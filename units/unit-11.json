          "content": "Pressure regulators are essential components in gas distribution systems, maintaining constant gas pressure at appliance inlets regardless of upstream pressure variations or downstream demand changes.\n\nRegulator Components:\n\nThree key elements in a pressure regulator:\n\n1. Restricting element (valve disc): Controls gas flow through the regulator\n2. Measuring element (diaphragm): Senses downstream pressure\n3. Loading element (spring): Provides the force to set desired outlet pressure\n\nForces in a Regulator:\n\nOpening force: Created by the adjustable spring above the diaphragm, pushing down to open the valve\nClosing force: Created by the pressure under the diaphragm (downstream pressure), pushing up to close the valve\n\nRegulator Equilibrium:\n\nA regulator is in equilibrium when the opening force of the spring equals the closing force of the downstream pressure. At this point, the valve disc maintains a position that delivers the exact pressure setpoint.\n\nAdjusting Downstream Pressure:\n\nTo increase downstream pressure: Screw down the adjusting screw (compresses spring, increases opening force)\nTo decrease downstream pressure: Screw out the adjusting screw (releases spring tension, decreases opening force)\n\nAtmospheric Vent:\n\nThe atmospheric vent allows air above the diaphragm to escape or enter as the diaphragm moves. This ensures the diaphragm can respond accurately to downstream pressure changes. A blocked vent port can cause incorrect regulator operation.\n\nInstalling Backward:\n\nIf a regulator is installed backward, the regulator will open completely because the high inlet pressure acts on the wrong side of the diaphragm, forcing it fully open.\n\nPressure Characteristics:\n\nDroop: The condition when outlet pressure is lower than the setpoint pressure during flow conditions. As flow increases through a regulator, downstream pressure decreases.\n\nLockup Pressure: The pressure downstream of a regulator under no flow conditions (static conditions). This is typically slightly higher than the flowing setpoint.\n\nPitot Tube:\n\nA pitot tube in a regulator increases upstream pressure sensing during flow conditions, keeping downstream pressure closer to the setpoint during flow. It provides more accurate pressure control under varying flow rates.\n\nRegulator Categories:\n\nService regulator: Reduces service line pressure to building line pressure at the gas meter set\nAppliance regulator: Reduces building line pressure to appliance manifold pressure\nFirst-stage regulator: Used in propane systems to reduce container pressure to intermediate pressure\nLine pressure regulator: Maintains building line pressure (typically 2 psig or 5 psig systems)\n\nSpecial Regulator Types:\n\nZero governor: Designed to deliver gas at zero gauge pressure in proportion to the suction pressure created by mechanical air flow to a premix burner\n\nAir/gas proportioning regulator: Delivers gas under pressure in proportion to the pressure created by mechanical air flow to a nozzle mix burner (not zero pressure like zero governor)\n\nTwo-stage regulators: Required in all permanent propane installations. First stage reduces container pressure to intermediate pressure (typically 10 psig), second stage reduces to appliance pressure (7 in w.c. or 11 in w.c.)\n\nAutomatic changeover regulator: Allows continuous gas flow when changing propane cylinders. Gas flow is NOT interrupted when changing a cylinder because the regulator automatically switches to the reserve cylinder.\n\nVent Requirements:\n\nPer CSA B149.1 Clause 5.2.1.7, regulators operating above 2 psig require properly sized vent piping. For a 5 psig line pressure regulator with a 3/4 in vent tapping running 65 ft, use 1 in pipe for the entire length and make the change at the vent tapping.\n\nException: A pressure regulator operating at 2 psig or less is exempt from vent piping requirements when equipped with a vent leak-limiting system.\n\nUndersized vent pipe may cause the regulator to respond slowly or sluggishly.\n\nReference Tube:\n\nThe purpose of a reference tube connected to combination gas valve regulator vent is to enable the regulator to automatically adjust for pressure changes in the burner enclosure (used in induced draft systems).\n\nHydrostatic Relief Valve:\n\nUsed in liquid propane systems to relieve pressure buildup from thermal expansion of trapped liquid propane.\n\nMaximum Propane Pressure:\n\nThe maximum allowed propane pressure in a single-family dwelling is 5 psig (except for specific appliances rated for 10 psig).\n\nFlow Rate Expression:\n\nFlow rate for a regulator is usually expressed in scf/h (standard cubic feet per hour).\n\nRegulator Sizing:\n\nWhen selecting a line pressure regulator for a 2 psig natural gas system sized for maximum allowable pressure drop, use the minimum operating inlet pressure (0.5 PSI) for capacity table selection to ensure adequate capacity under worst-case conditions.\n\nThe arrow on a regulator body should point downstream (in the direction of gas flow), not upstream.\n\nPropane Vapor Inlet Pressure:\n\nWhen sizing a propane regulator system, the cylinder outside temperature determines the lowest expected vapor inlet pressure. As temperature drops, propane vapor pressure decreases, reducing available inlet pressure to the regulator.",

          "content": "Overpressure protection devices prevent downstream pressure from exceeding the maximum safe operating pressure of system components. Several methods provide overpressure protection in gas systems.\n\nMaximum Allowable Pressure:\n\nThe maximum allowable pressure downstream of a pressure-controlling device is the lowest maximum pressure rating of any downstream component. All components must be protected to their lowest rated pressure.\n\nOverpressure Protection Methods:\n\n1. Pressure relief (venting excess gas)\n2. Pressure limiting (containment with regulator systems)\n3. Automatic shut-off (complete gas shut-off)\n\nDirect-Operated Relief Valves:\n\nDirect-operated relief valves measure system pressure with a diaphragm. The diaphragm senses downstream pressure and opens the relief valve when pressure exceeds the setpoint. A loading spring sets the relief pressure threshold.\n\nComponents:\n- Loading spring (sets relief pressure)\n- Diaphragm (measures system pressure)\n- Valve disk (restricting element)\n- Seat ring\n\nOperation: When system pressure overcomes spring force, the diaphragm lifts, opening the valve to vent excess pressure to atmosphere.\n\nPitot Tube Relief Valves:\n\nPitot tube-operated relief valves decrease pressure buildup over setpoint during high flow conditions. When the valve opens, high fluid velocity through the seat ring creates low pressure near the pitot tube end. This draws fluid from above the diaphragm, helping open the valve. Result: increased relief capacity with reduced pressure buildup.\n\nAdjusting Setpoint:\n\nRemove the cap and turn the adjusting nut:\n- Clockwise: Increases relief pressure\n- Counterclockwise: Decreases relief pressure\n\nApplication: Direct-operated relief valves are commonly used in natural gas systems supplying commercial enterprises such as restaurants, laundries, and industrial furnaces.\n\nInternal Relief Valves:\n\nRegulators with internal relief valves may eliminate the requirement for external overpressure protection. The internal relief valve shares the main measuring diaphragm and is located in the center of it.\n\nComponents:\n- Light-loading spring (for relief valve)\n- Main measuring diaphragm (shared)\n- Relief valve seat in center of main diaphragm\n- Pusher post\n\nOperation: During normal operation, both internal relief valve and main valve disc are closed. If overpressure develops (from dirt lodging or component failure), downstream pressure lifts the main diaphragm until the relief valve seat contacts the pusher post. Further pressure increase compresses both springs, separating the diaphragm and relief seat to vent gas through the center opening.\n\nNote: The loading force of the relief valve spring is NOT adjustable. This design generally requires significant pressure buildup to reach maximum relief flow rate.\n\nApplication: Internal relief valves are used in service regulators, line pressure regulators, and appliance regulators for industrial equipment.\n\nSizing Relief Valves:\n\nRelief valve size depends on:\n- System type\n- Pressure ranges\n- Application requirements\n- Manufacturer tables\n\nConsult manufacturer tables before choosing a relief valve. Set the relief valve pressure higher than the regulator setpoint, but within downstream pressure limitations.\n\nVenting Relief Valves:\n\nPer CSA B149.1 Clause 5.5 and manufacturer specifications:\n\nMinimum requirement: Relief valve vent must be at least the size of the vent outlet on the relief valve if termination point is less than 50 ft (15 m) away.\n\nFor additional length: For every additional 50 ft (15 m) or part thereof, increase vent outlet one size for its full length starting at the vent outlet.\n\nEquivalent length: A 90° elbow = 3 ft (1 m)\n\nFor long lengths, contact manufacturer or AHJ.\n\nPressure-Limiting Regulator Systems:\n\nPressure limiting is overpressure control by containment. Pressure-limiting regulators are acceptable overpressure protection devices.\n\nThree types:\n1. Wide-open monitor\n2. Series regulation\n3. Working monitor\n\nWide-Open Monitor:\n\nTwo regulators piped in series, both sensing downstream pressure after the second regulator.\n\nComponents:\n- Monitor regulator (setpoint slightly higher)\n- Worker regulator (setpoint slightly lower)\n\nOperation: Under normal conditions, monitor regulator is wide open. It only starts regulating if worker regulator fails.\n\nConfigurations:\n- Upstream monitor: Monitor regulator ahead of worker\n- Downstream monitor: Monitor regulator after worker\n\nDisadvantage: Monitor rarely exercised, may become bound, sluggish, or damaged.\n\nSeries Regulation (Two-Cut Systems):\n\nTwo regulators in series, each taking a pressure \"cut.\" The first unit maintains inlet pressure to the second valve within the maximum allowable operating pressure of the downstream system.\n\nAdvantage: If either regulator fails, the other maintains safe pressure downstream.\n\nWorking Monitors:\n\nCombines elements of series regulation and wide-open monitors. Both regulators work continuously as series regulators taking two pressure cuts.\n\nOperation:\n- Worker pilot controls intermediate pressure at intermediate value\n- Monitor pilot senses downstream pressure with setpoint slightly higher than required\n- When both work correctly, monitor is fully open trying to raise system pressure\n- Monitor allows worker pilot to control intermediate pressure\n- Both regulators respond to demand changes\n\nAdvantage: Both regulators continuously working, preventing clogging or sticking.\n\nAutomatic Shut-Off (OPSO/Slam-Shut):\n\nAccomplishes overpressure protection by complete containment - gas is shut off completely until malfunction is determined and device manually reset.\n\nApplication: Gas distribution companies use for places of public assembly (schools, hospitals, churches, shopping centers) as secondary overpressure protection. Also common in boiler combustion systems.\n\nToken Relief:\n\nThe regulator typically has a token internal relief to avoid nuisance trips of slam-shut mechanism due to small pressure increase from minor orifice damage or small obstruction.\n\nOperation: In overpressure conditions, safety plug is forced onto slam-shut seat, providing complete shutoff of gas flow. Some models also slam-shut on underpressure conditions (UPCO - Under Pressure Cut-Off).\n\nImportant: OPSO will NOT reset automatically - requires manual reset.\n\nEffect of Blocked Vent:\n\nIf a regulator vent becomes blocked while the regulator is in the open position, the regulator would remain open because air above the diaphragm cannot escape, preventing the diaphragm from moving to close the valve.\n\nLeast Obvious Failure Warning:\n\nOf commonly used overpressure protection methods, pressure limiting gives the least obvious failure warning because there is no venting or shutoff - one regulator fails and the other takes over silently.\n\nRelief Valve Effect on Capacity:\n\nA relief valve will NOT decrease the capacity of a regulator. Relief valves only activate during overpressure conditions and do not restrict normal gas flow.\n\nWide-Open Monitoring:\n\nIn wide-open monitoring systems, the monitor regulator is rarely exercised, which is a disadvantage because it may become bound or fail.",

          "content": "Gas meters measure the volume of gas flowing through them. Understanding meter types, reading methods, and calculation procedures is essential for verifying appliance inputs and system operation.\n\nDial-Type Meters:\n\nMost common type for residential installations. Two types of dials:\n\nConsumption dial: Indicates amount of gas consumed, provides information for billing purposes\n\nTest dial: Used to determine appliance input and detect downstream leaks. Shows immediate gas flow.\n\nEach meter displays \"PER REV\" showing volume measured per revolution (e.g., 1/2 ft³, 2 ft³, 5 ft³, or 0.05 m³, 0.5 m³).\n\nClocking a Meter:\n\n\"Clocking\" determines appliance input by timing test dial revolutions.\n\nProcedure:\n1. Ensure appliance being clocked is the ONLY appliance operating\n2. Allow appliance to fire continuously for about 5 minutes\n3. Take readings during stable operation\n4. Record time for one complete revolution of test dial\n5. Clock 2-3 times and use average\n6. Check meter's units of measurement\n7. Calculate volume per hour\n8. Convert to Btu/h (multiply by 1000 Btu/ft³ for natural gas or 2500 Btu/ft³ for propane)\n9. Compare to rated input on appliance rating plate\n\nImportant: Measured input should not exceed rated input or be less than 90% of rated input.\n\nFormulas:\n\nImperial: (3600 sec/hour ÷ seconds per revolution) × test dial size (ft³) × Btu/ft³ = Btu/h input\n\nMetric: (3600 sec/hour ÷ seconds per revolution) × test dial size (m³) × kW/m³ = kW input\n\nImperial and Metric Conversions:\n\nGas flow: 35.31 ft³ = 1 m³\nBurner input: 3412 Btu/h = 1 kW\nNatural gas CV: 1000 Btu/ft³ or 10.35 kW/m³\n\nFlow Rates with Pressure Compensation:\n\nWhen gas pressure exceeds 0.5 psig (3.5 kPa), flow rates require correction for pressure.\n\nFormula: Q = [3600 × V / t] × [(Pa + Pw) / Ps]\n\nWhere:\n- Q = Flow rate (ft³/h or m³/h)\n- V = Volume of test dial (ft³ or m³)\n- t = Time per revolution (seconds)\n- Pa = Local atmospheric pressure (psia or kPa)\n- Pw = Working pressure in meter (psig or kPa gauge)\n- Ps = Standard pressure (14.73 psia or 101.325 kPa)\n\nFlow Rates with Temperature Compensation:\n\nMost meters have temperature-compensating devices correcting to standardized temperature (60°F or 15.4°C).\n\nWhen meter is NOT temperature corrected and pressure exceeds 0.5 psig:\n\nFormula: Q = [3600 × V / t] × [(Pa + Pw) / Ps] × [Ts / T]\n\nWhere:\n- Ts = Base temperature (60°F or 15°C in absolute units)\n- T = Gas temperature at meter in absolute units\n\nNote: Gas heat values are based on temperature of 15°C.\n\nElectronic Correctors:\n\nTwo common types:\n\n1. TCI (Temperature Compensating Index):\n   - Converts volume from operating conditions to reference temperature conditions\n   - Temperature sensor in meter temperature well\n   - Displays UNC (uncorrected) and COR (corrected) volumes\n   - Correction factor typically close to 1.0 unless extreme temperatures\n\n2. EVC (Electronic Volume Corrector):\n   - Converts volume from operating to reference pressure AND temperature conditions\n   - Temperature sensor in temperature well\n   - Pressure transducer mounted in meter or separate connection\n   - Displays pressure correction factor, temperature correction factor\n   - May display live corrected flow rate\n\nElectronic metering features:\n- Continuous temperature/pressure readouts\n- Correction factor displays\n- Gas flow conditions indication\n- Load survey data storage\n- Computer connection capability (with software)\n\nUsing TCI/EVC for Clocking:\n\nLive flow rate display may show corrected or uncorrected flow depending on parameter settings. Contact utility or manufacturer to verify.\n\nIf displaying corrected flow rate in ft³/h: Simply multiply by appropriate CV of gas for that area (no clocking or calculations needed).\n\nBe aware: Utility can set display to ft³/h or m³/h.\n\nMeter Types for Different Applications:\n\nDiaphragm meter: Most common residential type, accurate at low flow rates, can be used for leak testing\n\nRotary meter: Used for higher flow commercial/industrial applications, NOT sufficiently accurate for leak testing small volumes\n\nElectronic volume corrector: Corrects for both temperature and pressure\n\nElectronic temperature compensating index: Corrects for temperature only\n\nUsing Meter to Leak Test:\n\nDiaphragm or bellows meters can leak test at working pressure. Rotary and orifice meters are NOT considered sufficiently accurate.\n\nProcedure:\n1. Turn off all gas-consuming devices (appliances and pilots) as close to appliance as possible\n2. Mark position of BOTH test dials using non-permanent marker\n3. Wait at least 10 minutes\n4. Check if either dial moved from marked position\n\nWhy mark both dials: Since they move at different speeds, unlikely both return to original position if leak exists. This catches the case where one dial completes a full revolution during test period.\n\nMovement indicates: Gas has passed through meter and is leaking from pipe (assuming all devices are shut off).\n\nTemperature and Pressure Effects:\n\nIf temperature of gas trapped in container increases: Pressure increases\n\nIf temperature of gas decreases in flexible container (diaphragm meter): Volume decreases",

          "content": "Propane fuel containers store liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and must be properly sized to provide adequate vapor or liquid supply to connected appliances under various operating conditions.\n\nCylinder Reinspection:\n\nA 100 lb propane cylinder must be reinspected and remarked every 10 years from the date of manufacture.\n\nVaporization Rate:\n\nVaporization rate is affected by:\n- Liquid level in container (1/4 full = lowest rate for sizing)\n- Temperature (lower temp = lower rate)\n- Humidity (higher humidity = higher rate)\n- Surface area (wetted surface transfers heat)\n- Container size and type\n\nThe level of liquid propane in a cylinder HAS a significant effect on vaporization rate. Containers are sized based on 25% full (1/4 full) to ensure adequate supply even when nearly empty.\n\nContainer Capacity:\n\nThe largest cylinder has 1000 lb water capacity. Maximum allowable liquid propane capacity is 420 lb (42% by weight, 80% by volume).\n\nMaximum fill level: 80% of water capacity by volume\n\nLoad Factors:\n\nAverage load factors for appliance types:\n- Domestic: 0.5 (appliances cycle on/off)\n- Commercial: 0.5\n- Industrial: 0.75\n- Agricultural: 1.0 (typically continuous operation)\n\nSpecific appliance load factors vary (see tables in textbook).\n\nEffective Load Calculation:\n\nFormula: Input rating × Load factor = Effective load\n\nFor multiple appliances:\n1. Determine input rating for each appliance\n2. Multiply each by proper load factor\n3. Add all effective loads together = Total effective load\n\nThis accounts for the fact that thermostat-controlled appliances don't operate continuously.\n\nWeather Conditions:\n\nAlways size containers for most trying weather conditions:\n1. Determine normal operating periods\n2. Determine lowest outside temperature during operation\n3. Use appropriate humidity level for area\n\nSizing Tables:\n\nThree tables for sizing containers:\n\nTable 4A-1: ASME aboveground tanks (three tables based on 50-60%, 60-70%, 70-80% humidity)\nTable 4A-2: ASME underground tanks (50°F constant)\nTable 4A-3: DOT/TC portable, exchange, and stationary cylinders\n\nAll ratings based on container 1/4 full and show vaporization rate in Btu/h.\n\nASME Aboveground Tanks:\n\nProcedure:\n1. Select humidity table (50-60%, 60-70%, or 70-80%)\n2. Select temperature column for lowest operating temperature\n3. Read down until finding Btu rating equal to or greater than effective load\n4. Read across to tank capacity (Gallons W.C.)\n\nASME Underground Tanks:\n\nUnderground tanks maintain approximately 50°F year-round due to earth temperature.\n\nProcedure:\n1. Read down 50°F column to find rating equal to or greater than effective load\n2. Read across to determine tank capacity\n\nImportant: Never undersize underground tank. If undersized, frost line develops and vaporization drops to zero, requiring tank replacement.\n\nDOT/TC Cylinders:\n\nFour vaporization rates per cylinder:\n- Winter high humidity (70%)\n- Winter low humidity (30%)\n- Summer high humidity (70%)\n- Summer low humidity (30%)\n\nProcedure:\n1. Select column for most severe weather conditions\n2. Determine cylinder type (portable, replaceable, stationary)\n3. Read down to find rating equal to or greater than effective load\n4. Read across to cylinder capacity\n\nNote: Exchange cylinder installations require one reserve cylinder for each supply cylinder (e.g., two supply = four total cylinders).\n\nPropane Vaporizers:\n\nDirect-fired vaporizers used when equipment demand exceeds natural vaporizing capacity and larger tank is not practical.\n\nOperation: Uses flame to directly heat liquid propane, accelerating vaporization. Essentially a boiler that doesn't build pressure.\n\nContainer Sizing for Liquid Withdrawal:\n\nBased on two considerations:\n1. Liquid withdrawal rate each day\n2. Minimizing gas delivery frequency\n\nConversion:\n- Effective load Btu/h ÷ 91,500 = gal/h\n- Effective load Btu/h ÷ 24,174 = L/h\n\nInstallation Clearances:\n\nCheck CSA B149.2 for complete requirements. Key distances:\n\nFrom property line/building openings (varies by tank size):\n- 125 USWG or less: 10 ft\n- Over 125 to 2,000 USWG: 10 ft\n- Over 2,000 to 5,000 USWG: 15 ft\n- Over 5,000 to 10,000 USWG: 25 ft\n\nFrom sources of ignition: 3 ft minimum (10 ft from fill connection)\n\nFrom building openings below relief valve: 5 ft horizontal\n\nDOT/TC cylinders:\n- 3 ft from building openings below relief valve\n- 10 ft from air intakes or ignition sources\n- Maximum 4 cylinders against a wall\n\nRelief Valve Settings:\n\nRelief valve setting of propane cylinder: 375 psig (for cylinders)\n\nSome references show 312 psig for ASME tanks.\n\nPurpose: Prevent tank/cylinder from rupturing due to overpressure.\n\nExcess Flow Valves:\n\nPurpose: Prevent excessive discharge of vapor or liquid in event of downstream line rupture.\n\nOperation: Automatically restricts flow when flow rate exceeds design threshold.\n\nFiller Valve:\n\nUsed to fill large stationary cylinders. Also acts as check valve to prevent excess flow (backflow).\n\nRelief Valve Service:\n\nA shut-off valve CAN be installed upstream of a relief valve to facilitate removal for servicing without emptying tank contents. However, during normal operation, this valve must be locked or sealed open.\n\nEmergency Procedures:\n\nIf leak occurs between first and second-stage regulators:\nFirst action: Shut off the propane container service valve\n\nIf relief valve on refillable propane container opens:\nFirst action: Shut off the propane container service valve\n\nAlternative if valve cannot be accessed: Cool tank with cold water to decrease pressure (reduces vapor pressure)\n\nOverfill Indicator:\n\nWhite fog or mist emitting from liquid level gauge indicates the maximum permitted filling level has been reached (80% full). This is caused by liquid propane venting and immediately vaporizing.\n\nVapor Pressure and Temperature:\n\nThe pressure in a propane container is directly related to the temperature of the liquid propane. As liquid temperature increases, vapor pressure increases.\n\nWhat happens when temperature increases: Vapor pressure increases\n\nSurface Area Effect:\n\nThe entire wetted surface of the container transfers heat and affects vaporization rate (not including top or bottom of horizontal cylinders in direct sun).\n\nCylinder Size Effect:\n\nLarger cylinders have higher vaporization rates. From the options provided (20 lb, 40 lb, 200 lb, 300 lb), assuming all 1/4 full, the 300 lb cylinder will have highest Btu/h vaporization rate.\n\nHumidity Effect:\n\nCylinders have LOWER vaporization rate when at higher humidity (this is opposite of what might be expected - the humidity comparison shows low humidity actually provides higher rates in the tables).",

For this reason, gas pressures must be controlled \nto fall within an appropriate pressure range, depending on the operating \ncharacteristics of installed appliances.\nPurpose of Gas Pressure \nRegulators\nReduce and maintain safe operating pressure\nFor the building and/or connected appliances regardless of \nchanges in the gas flow or upstream pressure.\nProvide means for pressure adjustment\nBy which the pressure to connected appliances or burners can be \nadjusted, set, and maintained.\nConsequences of Incorrect Gas \nPressure\nIf\nThen\nThe inlet pressure to the regulator is over 0.5 \npsi (3.5 kPa)\nThe requlator must provide an additional \nfunction to act as a positive shut-off device \nto ensure that downstream pressure does \nnot build up to unsafe levels under no flow \nconditions.\nA gas appliance receives too much fuel \nbecause the gas pressure is too great\nIt will overfire.\nIf the gas appliance receives too little fue\nIt will underfire.\nIf an appliance is overfired or underfired\n•\nIt will produce too much (overfired) and \ntoo little (underfired) heat.\n•\nCombustion characteristics could \nchange, resulting in carbon monoxide \ngeneration.\n•\nThe appliance may not work properly or \nefficiently.\nMain Categories of Gas Pressure Regulators\nCategory\nDescription\nFirst-stage regulators\n•\nUsed in all permanently installed propane systems to reduce the propane container pressure to service line pressure delivered \nto the second stage requlator\nSee Figure 1-1\nService regulators (commonly called second-stage regulators in propane systems)\n•\nUsed in both natural gas and propane systems to reduce the service line pressure to building line pressure at the gas meter set\nSee Figure 1-2\n•\nCommonly called second-stage regulators in line propane systems\nSee Figure 1-1\nLine pressure regulators\n•\nUsed to reduce the building line pressure in a branch line where the pressure required by appliances or equipment on that \nbranch line is less than the pressure in the main building line\nSee Figure 1-2\n•\nReferred as \"system regulators\" in CSA B149.1, prior to 2005\nNatural Gas Installation: \nService and Line Pressure \nRegulators\nFigure 1-2 Natural gas installation showing location of service regulator \nand line pressure regulators\nDirection of Flow in Pressure \nRegulators\nWhen installing a pressure regulator, the direction of gas flow is critical \nfor proper operation of the regulator. An arrow on the regulator casing \nindicates the direction of flow. Be certain that you install the regulator so \nthe flow arrow points in the direction of flow. (Direction of flow will be \ncovered in more detail later in this chapter.)\nUnderstanding Gas Flow \nTerminology\nKnowing these two commonly used terms is important since they are used \noften to explain where to place appliances. These refer to the placing of an \nitem in the system according to the flow of the gas:\n•\ndownstream; and\n•\nupstream.\nFlow\nDescription\nGas downstream of the regulator\nRefers to the gas flow after it has \npassed through the requlator\nGas upstream of the regulator\nRefers to the gas flow before it \npasses through the regulator\nPilot-Operated vs. Direct-\nOperated Regulators\nMost pressure regulators are either pilot-operated or direct-operated. \nPilot-operated regulators consist of two requlators with the same \nessential components as direct-operated units. The pilot can simply and \neffectively be considered a second requlator, providing additional control \nto the main regulator, improving overall sensitivity and, ultimately, \naccuracy. Pilot-operated regulators are used for high-capacity \napplications to supply gas to commercial, institutional, and industrial \nbuildings.\nThis level of training focuses on the operation of direct operated \nregulators, although, it covers servo regulation, which by definition is a \ntype of pilot operated control, as it applies to the appliance regulators \nbuilt into combination gas valves.\nBasic Operation of a Regulator\nMost service, system, and appliance regulators are direct-operated regulators that work in basically the same way.\nA direct-operated regulator is defined as any self-contained valve and actuator combination that automatically adjusts the \nflow in direct response to changes in downstream pressure, thereby matching the gas demand. Figure 1-3 illustrates a direct-\noperated regulator.\nEssential Elements of a \nDirect-Operated Regulator\nAs shown in Figure 1-3, these regulators have four essential elements.\nElement\nDescription\nLoading element\nUsually a spring\nMeasuring element\nUsually a diaphragm\nRestricting element\nAn orifice and valve seat\nAtmospheric vent\nA vent on the atmospheric side \nof the diaphragm\nHow a Regulator Works: \nAppliance Shut-off\nHere is how a regulator works:\n1. When the appliance shuts off, the pressure increases under the \ndiaphragm (or measuring element), pushing it up with greater force than \nthe spring (or loading element) is exerting downward. As a result, the \nvalve closes against the orifice (in a configuration known as the \nrestricting element). Air exiting the vent allows the diaphragm to move \nfreely.\nHow a Regulator Works: \nAppliance Start-up\n2. When the appliance starts, the loss in pressure downstream causes the \nspring to overcome the downstream pressure exerted on the measuring \nelement. As a result, the diaphragm moves downward, thus opening the \nvalve. Air entering the vent allows the diaphragm to move freely.\nHow a Regulator Works: \nEquilibrium\n3. The balancing of forces acting on the measuring element determines \nthe position of the valve in relation to the orifice. The diaphragm and \nvalve stabilize when the force under the diaphragm equals the force \nexerted by the spring. At this point, the regulator has found its point of \nequilibrium and the flow rate and pressure downstream match that which \nis required by the system.\nRegulator Response to Gas \nDemand Changes\nIf additional appliances start or an increase in firing rate occurs, the \ndiaphragm moves downward and the valve stabilizes in a new position to \nthe orifice, allowing more gas flow at the same pressure.\nIf gas demand decreases, the diaphragm moves upward and the valve \nstabilizes in a new position in relation to the orifice, allowing less gas flow \nat the same pressure. Air entering and exiting the vent allows the \ndiaphragm to move freely.\nNote: The closing force in a regulator is the downstream gas pressure.\nThe Loading Element: \nSpring\nThe loading element is used to counterbalance the downstream \npressure. It is usually a spring.\nThe amount of spring pressure on the diaphragm determines the \nposition of the restricting element.\nChanging the spring load can adjust the amount of flow through the \nregulator.\nFlow and Pressure Regulation Terminology\nFlow and pressure regulation\nDescription\nSetpoint\n•\nThe desired outlet pressure is known as the setpoint.\n•\nA perfect regulator could maintain downstream pressure equal to setpoint under all flow rates, but in reality, as flow rate \nincreases, the downstream pressure decreases.\nLockup\n•\nLockup is the pressure above setpoint that is used to shut the requlator off tight. In many requlators, the orifice has a machined \nedge, while the disk is made of a soft material. To make a tight seal, the requlator must increase the downstream pressure to \nforce the disk onto the machined edge. This extra amount of pressure required is called the lockup pressure.\n•\nRegulators that have an inlet pressure over 0.5 psi (3.5 kPa) must provide a positive shut-off when there is no gas demand \ndownstream. These regulators usually lock up to within 10% of the original outlet pressure setting.\nDroop and offset\n•\nDroop and offset describe the downstream pressure drop below setpoint. At this point, the valve is fully open, and there is an \nincreased gas demand downstream. Droop can be expressed as a percentage of setpoint pressure. Manufacturers publish \nregulator capacities according to their amounts of droop. These are generally for 10% droop and 20% droop. The accuracy of a \nregulator is determined by the amount of flow it can pass for a given amount of droop. The closer the requlator is to setpoint, \nthe more accurate it is.\n•\nIf the performance of a typical regulator is plotted on a graph, the graph will show how the flow rate of gas drops off drastically \nas the gas flo",

For this reason, gas pressures must be controlled to fall within an appropriate pressure range, depending on the operating characteristics of installed appliances.\nPurpose of Gas Pressure Regulators\nReduce and maintain safe operating pressure\nFor the building and/or connected appliances regardless of changes in the gas flow or upstream pressure.\nProvide means for pressure adjustment\nBy which the pressure to connected appliances or burners can be adjusted, set, and maintained.\nConsequences of Incorrect Gas Pressure\nIf\nThen\nThe inlet pressure to the regulator is over 0.5 psi (3.5 kPa)\nThe requlator must provide an additional function to act as a positive shut-off device to ensure that downstream pressure does not build up to unsafe levels under no flow conditions.\nA gas appliance receives too much fuel because the gas pressure is too great\nIt will overfire.\nIf the gas appliance receives too little fue\nIt will underfire.\nIf an appliance is overfired or underfired\nIt will produce too much (overfired) and too little (underfired) heat.\nCombustion characteristics could change, resulting in carbon monoxide generation.\nThe appliance may not work properly or efficiently.\nMain Categories of Gas Pressure Regulators\nCategory\nDescription\nFirst-stage regulators\nUsed in all permanently installed propane systems to reduce the propane container pressure to service line pressure delivered to the second stage requlator\nSee Figure 1-1\nService regulators (commonly called second-stage regulators in propane systems)\nUsed in both natural gas and propane systems to reduce the service line pressure to building line pressure at the gas meter set\nSee Figure 1-2\nCommonly called second-stage regulators in line propane systems\nSee Figure 1-1\nLine pressure regulators\nUsed to reduce the building line pressure in a branch line where the pressure required by appliances or equipment on that branch line is less than the pressure in the main building line\nSee Figure 1-2\nReferred as \"system regulators\" in CSA B149.1, prior to 2005\nAppliance regulators\nUsed to reduce low (max 0.5 psi) building or branch line pressure to the pressure required by the appliance\nOften built into a combination control\nAlso see the definitions provided in CSA B149.1.\nNatural Gas Installation: Service and Line Pressure Regulators\nFigure 1-2 Natural gas installation showing location of service regulator and line pressure regulators\nDirection of Flow in Pressure Regulators\nWhen installing a pressure regulator, the direction of gas flow is critical for proper operation of the regulator. An arrow on the regulator casing indicates the direction of flow. Be certain that you install the regulator so the flow arrow points in the direction of flow. (Direction of flow will be covered in more detail later in this chapter.)\nUnderstanding Gas Flow Terminology\nKnowing these two commonly used terms is important since they are used often to explain where to place appliances. These refer to the placing of an item in the system according to the flow of the gas:\ndownstream; and\nupstream.\nFlow\nDescription\nGas downstream of the regulator\nRefers to the gas flow after it has passed through the requlator\nGas upstream of the regulator\nRefers to the gas flow before it passes through the regulator\nPilot-Operated vs. Direct-Operated Regulators\nMost pressure regulators are either pilot-operated or direct-operated. Pilot-operated regulators consist of two requlators with the same essential components as direct-operated units. The pilot can simply and effectively be considered a second requlator, providing additional control to the main regulator, improving overall sensitivity and, ultimately, accuracy. Pilot-operated regulators are used for high-capacity applications to supply gas to commercial, institutional, and industrial buildings.\nThis level of training focuses on the operation of direct operated regulators, although, it covers servo regulation, which by definition is a type of pilot operated control, as it applies to the appliance regulators built into combination gas valves.\nBasic Operation of a Regulator\nMost service, system, and appliance regulators are direct-operated regulators that work in basically the same way.\nA direct-operated regulator is defined as any self-contained valve and actuator combination that automatically adjusts the flow in direct response to changes in downstream pressure, thereby matching the gas demand. Figure 1-3 illustrates a direct-operated regulator.\nEssential Elements of a Direct-Operated Regulator\nAs shown in Figure 1-3, these regulators have four essential elements.\nElement\nDescription\nLoading element\nUsually a spring\nMeasuring element\nUsually a diaphragm\nRestricting element\nAn orifice and valve seat\nAtmospheric vent\nA vent on the atmospheric side of the diaphragm\nHow a Regulator Works: Appliance Shut-off\nHere is how a regulator works:\n1. When the appliance shuts off, the pressure increases under the diaphragm (or measuring element), pushing it up with greater force than the spring (or loading element) is exerting downward. As a result, the valve closes against the orifice (in a configuration known as the restricting element). Air exiting the vent allows the diaphragm to move freely.\nHow a Regulator Works: Appliance Start-up\n2. When the appliance starts, the loss in pressure downstream causes the spring to overcome the downstream pressure exerted on the measuring element. As a result, the diaphragm moves downward, thus opening the valve. Air entering the vent allows the diaphragm to move freely.\nHow a Regulator Works: Equilibrium\n3. The balancing of forces acting on the measuring element determines the position of the valve in relation to the orifice. The diaphragm and valve stabilize when the force under the diaphragm equals the force exerted by the spring. At this point, the regulator has found its point of equilibrium and the flow rate and pressure downstream match that which is required by the system.\nRegulator Response to Gas Demand Changes\nIf additional appliances start or an increase in firing rate occurs, the diaphragm moves downward and the valve stabilizes in a new position to the orifice, allowing more gas flow at the same pressure.\nIf gas demand decreases, the diaphragm moves upward and the valve stabilizes in a new position in relation to the orifice, allowing less gas flow at the same pressure. Air entering and exiting the vent allows the diaphragm to move freely.\nNote: The closing force in a regulator is the downstream gas pressure.\nThe Loading Element: Spring\nThe loading element is used to counterbalance the downstream pressure. It is usually a spring.\nThe amount of spring pressure on the diaphragm determines the position of the restricting element.\nChanging the spring load can adjust the amount of flow through the regulator.\nFlow and Pressure Regulation Terminology\nFlow and pressure regulation\nDescription\nSetpoint\nThe desired outlet pressure is known as the setpoint.\nA perfect regulator could maintain downstream pressure equal to setpoint under all flow rates, but in reality, as flow rate increases, the downstream pressure decreases.\nLockup\nLockup is the pressure above setpoint that is used to shut the requlator off tight. In many requlators, the orifice has a machined edge, while the disk is made of a soft material. To make a tight seal, the requlator must increase the downstream pressure to force the disk onto the machined edge. This extra amount of pressure required is called the lockup pressure.\nRegulators that have an inlet pressure over 0.5 psi (3.5 kPa) must provide a positive shut-off when there is no gas demand downstream. These regulators usually lock up to within 10% of the original outlet pressure setting.\nDroop and offset\nDroop and offset describe the downstream pressure drop below setpoint. At this point, the valve is fully open, and there is an increased gas demand downstream. Droop can be expressed as a percentage of setpoint pressure. Manufacturers publish regulator capacities according to their amounts of droop. These are generally for 10% droop and 20% droop. The accuracy of a regulator is determined by the amount of flow it can pass for a given amount of droop. The closer the requlator is to setpoint, the more accurate it is.\nIf the performance of a typical regulator is plotted on a graph, the graph will show how the flow ",
