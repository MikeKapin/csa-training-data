          "content": "Basic electrical concepts for gas-fired equipment installations require understanding of voltage levels, wiring types, protection devices, and code requirements.\n\nLow-Voltage Control Circuits:\n\nThe CE Code defines low-voltage circuits as operating from 31V to 1000V AC inclusive. Motor-control circuits may operate at 600V, requiring conductors rated accordingly.\n\nExtra-Low-Voltage Circuits:\n\nExtra-low-voltage circuits operate at 30V or less. Residential thermostat, gas valve, and zone valve control circuits fall into this category. These circuits generally use cable No. 16 AWG or smaller.\n\nData Cabling:\n\nModern gas equipment often equipped with network interface devices for LAN connection. Three basic cable types:\n\n1. Twisted pair (most common for short/medium connections)\n2. Coaxial\n3. Fiber-optic\n\nUnshielded twisted-pair (UTP): Most common in computer networking. Twisting of conductor pairs provides shielding from electromagnetic interference.\n\nShielded twisted-pair (STP) and screened twisted-pair: Additional shielding from high-frequency signals using foil or braided metal fiber.\n\nConductor Colour Codes:\n\nWhite: Only for insulated neutral conductors or identified conductors\nGreen: Only for insulated grounding or bonding conductors\nRed, black, and blue: Typically identifies live (ungrounded) conductors\n\nNon-Metallic Sheathed Cable (NMSC/NMD):\n\nMost commonly used for branch circuit wiring. Usually has PVC or polyethylene plastic insulation serving as outer covering.\n\nCautions:\n- Can burn and transmit fire when ignited\n- Burning emits highly toxic gases with dense smoke\n- Acidic gas emissions may corrode metals\n\nArmoured Cable (BX):\n\nFlexible outer metal sheath protects insulated conductors. CE Code Rules 12-600 to 12-618 cover installation requirements.\n\nTypes:\n- Type AC: Dry locations only\n- Type ACL: Moisture resistance required (additional lead covering)\n- Type ACWU: Wet locations and underground (thermoplastic outer covering)\n- TECK: Exposed wiring and adverse service conditions (voltage ratings: 600V, 1kV, or 5kV)\n\nAluminum-Sheathed Cable (ASC):\n\nSeamless aluminum protective sheath with smooth or corrugated finish. Corrugated type called RA90 (trade name: Corflex). PVC outer covering allows use in adverse conditions. Common in industrial applications (600V to 5000V).\n\nCE Code Table D1 specifies ASC voltage ratings. Rules 12-700 to 12-718 cover installation requirements.\n\nMineral-Insulated Cable (MI):\n\nMagnesium oxide filler between uninsulated internal conductors and outer metallic sheath (usually copper tubing). Fire-resistant construction. Often called Pyrotenax.\n\nApplications: Where conductors may be exposed to mechanical damage, moisture, or high temperatures.\n\nRequirements: Special termination kits for uninsulated conductors\nRatings: Standard MI up to 600V, LWMI (lightweight) up to 300V\n\nFlexible Cord and Cable:\n\nNot allowed for permanent wiring installations. Used to connect appliances and equipment with attachment plugs.\n\nTypes:\n\nHeater cord: Portable electric heating units, 2-4 conductors, high-temperature jacket, 300V max, No. 18 to No. 14 AWG\n\nGeneral-service cord (cab tire): Portable appliances subject to hard usage\n- SJ: 300V rated\n- S: 600V rated\n- SJOW: 300V outdoor use\n- SOW: 600V outdoor use\n- Available 2-4 conductors, No. 18 to No. 10 AWG\n\nPower-supply cables: Similar to general-service cord, higher currents, up to 600V, 2-4 conductors, No. 8 to No. 2 AWG\n\nElectrical Service:\n\nElectrical service supplied to a building is measured in volts (voltage).\n\nElectric meter records kilowatt-hours (kWh) of energy consumption.\n\nGround Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI):\n\nProtects users from shock hazards in damp conditions. Detects ground faults and interrupts power.\n\nReset: Push button on receptacle (not at panel, not by replacing fuse, not by moving handle).\n\nBonding:\n\nDefinition: Permanently joining all non-current-carrying metal parts to ensure electrical continuity.\n\nMinimum conductor size for bonding gas piping systems to building's electrical grounding: No. 6 AWG\n\nOvercurrent Protection:\n\nMost common device in residential applications: Circuit breakers (not fuses, not GFCI, not transformers)\n\nMaximum ampacity values for overcurrent protection devices specified in: CSA C22.1 (CE Code)\n\nCauses of overcurrent:\n1. Short circuit (most likely)\n2. Motor startup (normal, brief overcurrent)\n\nElectrical overload: Does NOT occur very quickly (develops gradually as heat builds up)\n\nAdvantage of circuit breakers over fuses: Can be easily reset (not replaced, not lower failure rate, cannot be bypassed)\n\nWire Conductors:\n\nWire is the most common form of electrical conductor.\n\nStranded wire has nearly the same current-carrying capacity as solid wire of the same gauge.\n\nAWG sizing: Lower number = larger diameter = higher ampacity\n- No. 10 AWG has GREATER ampacity than No. 14 AWG\n\nInstallation with Steel Studs:\n\nFor installations with steel studs and joists as framing members: Use armoured cable (BX)\n- Not NMSC, not NMD, not SOW (flexible cord)\n\nInterrupting Capacity:\n\nDefinition: The maximum supply amperage that the breaker is rated for\n- Not the protected circuit amperage\n- Not when breaker begins to open\n- Not unbalanced current amount\n\nLow-Voltage AC Circuit Operation:\n\nLow-voltage AC circuits operate at: 31V to 1000V\n- Not 1000 mV or less (that's 1V)\n- Not 1V to 30V (that's extra-low)\n- Not 30V to 250V (incorrect range)\n\nAdverse Service Conditions:\n\nType of armoured cable for adverse service conditions: TECK (not AC, not ACL, not ACWU)",

          "content": "Proper use of electrical measuring instruments is essential for troubleshooting gas-fired equipment. The digital multimeter (DMM) is the primary tool for electrical measurements.\n\nDigital Multimeter (DMM):\n\nA multimeter incorporates all of the following basic electrical meters:\n- Voltmeter\n- Ammeter\n- Ohmmeter\n\nFunctions enable measurement of voltage, current, resistance, and often capacitance, frequency, and continuity.\n\nClamp-On Ammeter:\n\nCan measure current in a conductor WITHOUT being inserted into circuit. Useful for checking loads like electric motors without interrupting operation.\n\nProcedure:\n1. Open ammeter jaws by squeezing handle\n2. Close jaws over conductor\n3. Ensure ONLY ONE conductor enclosed (if both live and neutral enclosed, meter reads zero)\n4. Ensure jaws completely closed (dirty/obstructed jaws = inaccurate reading)\n5. Read current on ammeter display\n\nNote: In-line ammeter is connected in series with circuit, requires breaking circuit.\n\nAmmeter Connection:\n\nAn ammeter is connected in SERIES with circuit under test (not parallel).\n\nMeasuring Resistance:\n\nOhmmeter used to measure resistance.\n\nConnection: Across unpowered device or circuit\n\nImportant: Ohmmeter should NEVER be connected to live circuit - will damage meter and create safety hazard\n\nBest practice: Isolate devices being tested from circuit\n\nContinuity Check:\n\nA continuity check is a measurement of resistance. Low resistance indicates continuity (continuous path). High resistance or \"OL\" (overload/open circuit) indicates no continuity.\n\nWhen probes touched together in resistance test: Meter should read 0 (zero ohms)\n\nDMM Symbols:\n\nCommon symbols:\n- AC: Alternating current (wavy line ~)\n- DC: Direct current (solid/dashed lines)\n- Ω: Ohms (resistance)\n- V: Volts\n- A: Amperes\n- Hz: Hertz (frequency)\n- μF: Microfarad (capacitance)\n- Continuity: Speaker/sound wave symbol\n- +/- : Positive/negative polarity\n- Low battery indicator\n- OL: Overload/open circuit\n\nUnit Conversions:\n\nVoltage conversions:\n- 250 mV = 0.25 V (divide mV by 1000)\n- 1000 mV = 1 V\n\nResistance conversions:\n- 2.125 kΩ = 2125 Ω (multiply kΩ by 1000)\n- 1 kΩ = 1000 Ω\n\nTesting Furnace Fan Circuit:\n\nDMM should be set at voltage AC function when testing furnace fan circuit.\n\nStep 1 - Check appliance disconnect switch:\n- Verify disconnect wired into L1 (hot line)\n- Verify disconnect shuts off power supply\n\nStep 2 - Take readings for circuit voltages:\n- L1 to ground with disconnect closed: Should read 120V\n- N to ground with disconnect closed: Should read 0V\n\nStep 3 - Open disconnect and retake readings:\n- Verify L1 to ground: 0V\n- Verify N to ground: 0V\n- Confirms disconnect on L1 and shuts off power\n\nStep 4 - Retake reading with disconnect closed:\n- Between L1 and N: Should read 120V (source voltage)\n\nStep 5 - Take readings across fan switch:\n- Open fan switch: Should read 120V\n- Closed fan switch: Should read 0V\n\nStep 6 - Take readings across motor terminals:\n- Fan switch open: Should read 0V\n- Fan switch closed (motor energized): Should read 120V\n\nTesting Transformer Circuit:\n\n120V AC line voltage circuit to high limit and step-down transformer:\n\nMeter A (across L1 and N): Should read 120V (source voltage)\n\nMeter B (across high limit):\n- Closed high limit: Should read 0V\n- Open high limit: Should read 120V\n\nMeter C (secondary side of transformer): Should read 24V (or slightly higher with no load, 26-27V)\n\nTesting 24V Control Circuit:\n\nConsists of 24V AC power supply, gas valve, and thermostat:\n\nMeter A (across thermopile terminals):\n- Should read 24V with load\n- 26-27V with no load on transformer\n- Returns to 24V when control circuit energized\n\nMeter B (across thermostat terminals):\n- Thermostat open (no call for heat): Should read 24V\n- Thermostat closed (call for heat): Should read 0V\n\nMeter C (across gas valve coil):\n- Thermostat open: Should read 0V\n- Thermostat closed: Should read 24V\n\nSwitch State Diagnosis:\n\nIf you measure voltage across a switch in energized circuit: Switch is OPEN\n\nIf you measure correct voltage across a load but load does not work: The load has failed\n\nSeries Circuit Voltage:\n\nIf one component in series circuit is open: Voltage drop across open component will equal source voltage\n\nLocation B Reading:\n\nOn typical furnace diagram with 120V supply to 24V transformer:\n- Location B (secondary of transformer with no load): Would read approximately 24V AC (or slightly higher 26-27V with no load)\n\nAmpere vs Current:\n\nAmpere is also known as: Current (not power, not resistance, not electromotive force)\n\nSafety Requirements:\n\nTesting circuits may require working with live voltage. Use extreme caution.\n\nFollow CSA Z462 as minimum requirement for live work:\n- Only if trained\n- Only if authorized by employer\n- Using all recommended personal protective equipment\n- Consider arc flash hazards",

Used to control large currents and high voltages for industrial equipment.\n\nComponents:\n- Solenoid coil (typically 110V or 24V control circuit)\n- Armature with insulators\n- Conductive crossbars\n- Multiple sets of contacts\n\nOperation: Switch in coil circuit simultaneously activates high-voltage circuit (e.g., 208V three-phase to motor).\n\nDifference from relay: Contacts rated for large currents (heavy duty), can have multiple contact sets, magnetically operated\n\nThree-Phase Motor Starters:\n\nMagnetic motor starters required for three-phase motors to provide:\n- Overload sensing circuit\n- Protection from single-phase conditions\n- Protection from excessive current draw\n- Thermal overload protection\n\nComponents:\n- Contactor with multiple contacts (one per phase)\n- Thermal overload relays\n- START/STOP control buttons\n- Holding contacts\n\nOperation: START button energizes coil, closes all phase contacts simultaneously. Thermal overload trips if motor overheats or draws excessive current.\n\nResidential Distribution Panel:\n\nHot wires in service conductors: Two (in residential single-phase 120/240V service)\n\nBranch circuits start: At the distribution panel (not wall switch, not pole transformer, not appliance transformer)\n\nContinuous ground: Connects at each receptacle, each appliance, and each junction box\n\nTransformers:\n\nRated by: The amount of power the secondary windings can handle\n- Not by voltage supply alone\n- Not by connected circuit breaker\n- Not by ampacity of supply conductors\n\nRating expressed in VA (volt-amperes) or kVA (kilovolt-amperes)\n\nElectrical Connections:\n\nAll electrical connections should be made: In outlet or junction boxes\n- Not in conduit\n- Not in appliance (unless manufacturer-provided connection)\n- Not in distribution panel (except main connections)\n\nBonding Conductors:\n\nBonding conductors must NOT be soldered. Use mechanical connections (crimps, bolts, clamps).\n\nReason: Solder can melt in fault conditions, compromising ground.\n\nSwitches:\n\nLocation: Always located in hot leg of circuit (never in neutral)\n\nPosition to conduct current: Closed position (not open)\n\nOperation: Manually or by pressure, temperature, fluid flow (all of the above)\n\nToggle Motor Starters:\n\nDespite similarity to light switch contacts, toggle motor starter contacts are: HP-rated (horsepower-rated)\n- Not just current-rated\n- Not located on neutral leg\n- Not solder-only connections\n\nThis rating accounts for high inrush currents and sustained motor loads.\n\nRelays:\n\nOperate according to: Solenoid principle (electromagnet principle)\n- Not microwave principle\n- Not Bernoulli's principle\n- Not plasma principles\n\nControl relays: NOT best suited for controlling single-phase pumps of any size (limited to smaller loads)\n\nFor larger single-phase motors: Use motor starters or contactors\n\nBoxes:\n\nDevice Boxes:\n\nSupport switches and other devices. Two types:\n1. Gangable type (one side removable to add boxes)\n2. Non-gangable type\n\nCE Code requirements:\n- Gas appliances connected to electrical circuit must have disconnect switch\n- Switch mounted near appliance in approved box\n- Used to shut off power during emergencies or servicing\n- Must be accessible without passing close to furnace\n- Must be clearly marked\n\nJunction Boxes:\n\nOften mounted directly on gas appliance. Connections between branch circuit and appliance control system made in junction box.\n\nPurpose:\n- Meet CE Code requirements\n- Prevent short circuits\n- Prevent electric shock hazards\n\nOctagon boxes: Support lighting fixtures or junction points, can be switch/outlet boxes with special covers\n\nSquare boxes:\n- 4 in wide (most common) - can be fitted for switches, receptacles, pilot lights\n- 4 11/16 in square - generally for range or dryer receptacles\n\nGangable Box:\n\nDefinition: Multiple boxes that can be joined together (not switch-only, not receptacle-only, not octagonal-type)\n\nSockets and Plugs:\n\nSpecialty types can be locking or non-locking.\n\nNon-locking: Inserted straight, relies on contact friction, pulled straight out\n\nLocking: Inserted straight, rotated clockwise to lock, must be rotated counterclockwise to withdraw\n\nEach assembly has different configurations and voltage/current ratings based on application.\n\nCrimp-On Connectors:\n\nCrimp-on connectors are NOT convenient without special tools. They require crimping tools for proper installation.\n\nConduit and Tubing:\n\nUsed to contain and protect electrical conductors. Classified by wall thickness, mechanical stiffness, and material.\n\nTypes:\n- RMC (Rigid Metal Conduit): Made to same dimensions as standard pipe\n- EMT (Electrical Metallic Tubing): Thin-walled metal tubing\n- Rigid PVC conduit: Rigid non-metallic\n- FMC (Flexible Metallic Conduit): Easily bent without tools\n- LFMC (Liquid-tight Flexible Metallic Conduit): For wet locations\n\nCE Code covers installation requirements depending on equipment type, location, or hazard.",

With thermostat calling for heat, depress manual reset\n2. Light pilot, wait for 170 mV reading\n3. Release manual reset button\n4. If valve doesn't hold in, replace coil\n5. If holds in, blow out pilot and watch meter\n6. If coil drops out over 140 mV, replace coil\n\nTesting 500 mV Control Systems:\n\nFive test positions measure different voltage drops:\n\nPosition 1: Thermopile full output (254 mV typical)\nPosition 2: Valve coil voltage (140 mV typical, minimum 60 mV to open, safety margin to 150 mV)\nPosition 3: Thermostat and wire total loss (112 mV typical, max 50 mV without anticipator, 110 mV with anticipator)\nPosition 4: Thermostat loss (80 mV typical, max 8 mV without anticipator, 100 mV with anticipator)\nPosition 5: Limit and wire loss (2 mV typical, should be close to zero)\n\nWire loss calculation: Position 3 - Position 4 = Wire loss\nIf over 60 mV, check for poor splices\n\nVerification: Position 2 + Position 3 + Position 5 should equal Position 1 (within 15 mV)\n\nTroubleshooting Example 1:\n\nReadings: 1=269 mV, 2=77 mV, 3=190 mV, 4=30 mV, 5=2 mV\nProblem: Wire loss = 190 - 30 = 160 mV (too high)\nSolution: Bad wiring contacts or poor splice, clean terminals and solder splice\n\nTroubleshooting Example 2 (Circuit diagram with 5 positions):\n\nReading 1=500 mV, 2=500 mV, 3=0 mV, 4=0 mV, 5=0 mV\nProblem: Broken coil in gas valve\nAnalysis: Full voltage at position 1 and 2, but zero across thermostat circuit indicates valve coil open circuit\n\nReading 1=500 mV, 2=0 mV, 3=500 mV, 4=0 mV, 5=0 mV\nProblem: Faulty thermostat wiring\nAnalysis: Voltage present across thermostat/wire position but not reaching valve indicates wiring issue\n\n750 mV Systems:\n\nTwo circuits powered:\n1. Safety circuit: Pilotstat coil only\n2. Control circuit: Thermostat, limit switch, gas valve coil\n\nWired in parallel so safety circuit continuously energized.\n\nOpen-circuit voltage: 750 mV\nWith pilotstat connected: Drops to approximately 550 mV at position 1\nWith both circuits closed: Drops to 185 mV (no anticipator) or 240 mV (with anticipator)\n\nControl circuit test values same as 500 mV systems.\n\nMillivolt Thermostats:\n\nVoltage rating of dedicated millivolt thermostat: 0 to 1.5 V DC\n- Not 120 V AC\n- Not 20 to 30 V AC\n- Not 250 to 750 V DC\n\nImportant: Using 24V thermostat on millivolt system causes excessive resistance and voltage loss. Using millivolt thermostat on 24V AC system damages thermostat.\n\nMost digital thermostats rated for both 24V AC or millivolt systems (run on backup batteries when wired for millivolt).\n\nTotal System Resistance:\n\nTotal electrical resistance in control system includes: Heat anticipator in thermostat (statement is TRUE)\n\nSelf-Powered System Components:\n\n- Pilot burner\n- Thermopile or pilot generator\n- Diaphragm gas valve (includes safety shut-off)\n- Limit switch\n- Millivolt thermostat (may include heat anticipator)\n- Wire runs connecting devices\n\nWiring Requirements:\n\nManufacturer recommends maximum lengths (statement is TRUE)\n\nCorrect type and gauge critical for staying within system resistance limits.\n\nMaximum wire run lengths (typical, may vary by manufacturer):\n\nUp to 30 ft (9 m): Use No. 18 AWG minimum\nUp to 50 ft (15 m): Use No. 16 AWG minimum\nUp to 80 ft (24 m): Use No. 14 AWG minimum\n\nRecommended maximum length using typical LVT No. 18 AWG on millivolt system: 30 ft (9 m)\n- Not 5 ft\n- Not 50 ft (requires No. 16 AWG)\n- Not 80 ft (requires No. 14 AWG)\n\nGuidelines for two-wire control system cables.

          "content": "AC electric motors are critical components in gas-fired equipment, driving fans, blowers, and pumps. Understanding motor types, protection devices, and control systems is essential.\n\nMotor Nameplate Information:\n\nWhere found: On motor nameplate (not frame, not housing, not armature)\n\nInformation includes:\n- Rated horsepower (HP)\n- Speed (RPM)\n- Full load amperage (FLA)\n- Date code\n- Voltage rating\n- Service factor\n- Frame size\n\nMotor Main Parts:\n\nTwo main parts: Stator and rotor (not capacitor, not centrifugal switch - these are accessories)\n\nStator: Stationary part with coil windings creating rotating magnetic field\nRotor: Rotating part inside stator, turns due to magnetic field interaction\n\nWound Rotor vs Squirrel Cage:\n\nDifference: Wound rotor motor has insulated windings (with slip rings and brushes for external resistance connection)\n\nSquirrel cage induction motor: Does NOT have insulated windings (has cast aluminum or copper bars short-circuited by end rings), no slip rings or brushes\n\nSquirrel cage characteristics:\n- Simpler construction\n- Lower maintenance\n- No brushes to wear\n- Most common type\n\nThree-Phase Induction Motors:\n\nStator phase coils can be connected: Delta or Wye (not AC/DC, not in phase/out of phase, not synchronized/asynchronized)\n\nDelta: Coils connected in triangle\nWye: Coils connected in Y-shape with common center point\n\nSynchronous Motors:\n\nBiggest design difference from induction motor: DC electromagnetic rotor (not squirrel cage rotor, not start capacitor, not external start resistor)\n\nSynchronous motor rotor has DC electromagnets creating constant magnetic poles. Rotates in exact synchronization with rotating magnetic field (no slip).\n\nStarting Relays:\n\nThree types in common use:\n\n1. Current Relay:\n\nHas normally open contacts that close with high inrush current and open once motor reaches running speed.\n\nOperation:\n- Coil in series with run winding\n- Weight or spring holds start contacts open when idle\n- High starting current magnetizes coil, closes start contacts\n- As motor accelerates, current decreases, relay opens start contacts\n- Used on small capacitor-start induction-run motors\n\n2. Potential Relay:\n\nHas normally closed set of start winding contacts opened by relay coil after motor starts.\n\nOperation:\n- Contacts held closed by gravity or spring\n- Coil connected across start winding\n- As motor accelerates, voltage across start winding increases (back EMF)\n- Higher voltage energizes coil, opens normally closed contacts\n- No arcing when circuit initially closes (big advantage)\n- Used with larger capacitor-start motors\n\n3. Solid-State Relay:\n\nUses transistors, diodes, and triacs to break start windings circuit at correct time.\n\nOperation:\n- Senses voltage changes in motor as it starts\n- Opens start circuit at correct speed\n- Not as sensitive to motor size\n- Same relay can work for motors 1/12 to 1/3 HP\n\nCapacitors:\n\nTesting and Replacement:\n\nWhen removing or replacing capacitor: Always short out terminals to drain any stored charge (safety precaution)\n\nReplacement capacitor: Should be same voltage and capacity as old capacitor. If different, should be 5-10% over capacity rather than under.\n\nMost common cause of failure: Ground or open-circuit condition\n\nTesting: Most multimeters check for ground or open-circuit conditions\n\nOverload Protection Devices:\n\nPurpose: To protect motor from overheating\n\nTwo fundamental principles:\n\n1. Temperature-Sensing Device (Motor Thermostat):\n\nDirectly senses motor-winding temperature. Does NOT carry current (would give false reading if it did). Usually automatic reset type.\n\nReset time: 20 min to 1 hour (small motor), several hours (large motor). Prolonged if multiple trips in succession or motor already hot.\n\nInternal type: Better protection, faster response\nExternal type: Cannot sense changes as quickly\n\n2. Current-Sensing Device (Temperature Disc, Klixon Disc):\n\nCurrent flows through bimetal disc, heats it. Predetermined current causes disc to warp, opens contacts. After cooling, automatically resets.\n\nType: Replica protection\n\nMounting: Inside small motor housings or externally\n\nReplacement: Must use exact replacement for proper protection. Place where manufacturer designated.\n\nExternal Overload Protection:\n\nProvided by starter with overload devices calibrated to motor operating conditions. Can be manual or automatic.\n\nThermal overload: Trips starter and disengages circuit under excessive conditions.\n\nThree-phase motors require overload sensing for:\n- Single-phase conditions (phase loss)\n- Excessive current draw from high load demands\n\nMotor Insulation:\n\nPrimary cause of failure: Motor overheating\n\nFunctions:\n1. Separate electrical components from each other and structural parts\n2. Protect from contaminants and destructive forces\n\nHeat causes deterioration, resulting in breakdown, short circuits, and motor failure.\n\nAmbient Temperature:\n\nStandard ambient temperature for insulation rating: 40°C (104°F)\n\nMotor begins to overheat when air or contacting medium exceeds 40°C.\n\nBearings:\n\nTypes:\n- Sleeve bushing (requires periodic lubrication through grease fittings)\n- Ball bearing (sealed, self-lubricating)\n- Roller bearing (sealed, self-lubricating)\n\nDetermining lubrication needs: By presence of grease fittings (not rating plate, specifications, or power supply)\n\nWhen repaired: May replace with sealed-for-life bearings, remove grease fittings, plug holes\n\nMotor Direction of Rotation:\n\nViewed from: Drive end of motor (not top, not either end, not non-drive end)\n\nSpeed Control:\n\nDirect Drive Motors:\n\nPSC direct drive fan motor: Directly linked to fan wheel\n\nMultispeed PSC motor: Identified by number of wires at electrical connections\n\nDetermine speed tap wires: By wiring schematic color codes (not trial and error, not furnace specs, not control board schematic)\n\nSpeed control: More resistance = slower speed, less resistance = higher speed\n\nElectronically Commutated Motor (ECM):\n\nBest description: DC, three-phase motor with permanent magnet rotor (not split-phase induction, not shaded-pole induction, not PSC)\n\nConstruction:\n- Two separate components: motor and control section\n- Microprocessor calibrated at factory\n- Motor has permanent magnet rotor (no windings in rotor)\n- Control section includes microprocessor\n\nOperation:\n- Adapts speed to match system conditions\n- Maintains set CFM (like cruise control)\n- Monitors relationship between speed, torque, and airflow\n- As static pressure increases (dirty filter), increases RPM to maintain CFM\n- Efficiency range: 60-80% among all speeds\n- PSC motor: 10% efficiency at low speeds, 50% at high speeds\n\nCommunication: 16-pin harness from control board indicating desired CFM for operating state\n\nMotion Control Positioning Motors:\n\nTypes commonly referred to as:\n- Actuating motors\n- Motor operators\n- Modulating motors\n- Electronic actuators\n\nMethods:\n1. Powered fully open or closed\n2. Floating action\n3. Servo motors\n4. Stepper motors\n\nFloating Action:\n\nReceives powered voltage control signal to move valve. Controller provides power to drive motor open or closed, or no power to remain in position. Simple, cost-effective. Uses actuator timing to position valve.\n\nStepper Motors:\n\nOpen-loop positioning system converting digital pulses into mechanical shaft rotations. Brushless DC motor moving in increments (steps) rather than smooth rotation.\n\nOperation:\n- Internal rotor: magnetic wheel with salient poles\n- External magnets switched electronically\n- Coils switched on/off in specific sequence\n- Motor shaft turns one step at a time\n- Can operate clockwise or counterclockwise\n- Holds position until different coils energized\n- Steps per revolution: 4 to 500 (90° to 0.75° per step)\n\nApplication: Gas valves with stepper motor modulate servo regulator, fully modulating manifold pressure and firing rate.\n\nServo Motors:\n\nPart of closed-loop system. Includes positioning circuit accepting analogue control signal (0-10V or 4-20mA).\n\nFeatures:\n- Position sensor (potentiometer) feeds actual position back to positioning circuit\n- Can position along stroke in proportion to control signal\n- Used where high degree of accuracy and acceleration required\n\nActuator interprets control signal as valve position between limit switches.",

A three-phase system is generally \nmore economical than equivalent single-phase or two-\nphase systems at the same voltage.\nThree-phase, three- and four-wire systems are used for \nindustrial and commercial applications.\nFour-Wire System Components\n•\nThree hot line wires\n•\nA ground wire\n•\nA neutral may also be included, at times\nFour commonly supplied voltages are: 120/208 V, 240/416 \nV, 347/600 V, and 600 V.\nThree-Phase Wire Color \nCoding\nWire\nColour\nNeutral (when present)\nWhite or natural grey\nPhase A (phase wire A)\nRed\nPhase B (phase wire B)\nBlack\nPhase C (phase wire C)\nBlue\nThe neutral wire (the identified circuit conductor) must have the same \ncolour throughout the whole length of the circuit it services, for \nconductor sizes up to No. 2 AWG. Identified circuit conductors larger \nthan No. 2 AWG must be identified at both ends with white tape, unless \nthe conductor is white.\nResidential Service \nRequirements\nMinimum Requirements\nThe minimum requirement in most new residential construction is 100-\namp service\nOlder Homes\nMany older homes have 60-amp services\nElectric Heating\nHomes heated by electricity require a 200-amp service\nService Upgrades\nAs more appliances are added, the electrical service may need to be \nupgraded to a higher amperage rating\nElectrical Distribution System Components\nElectric Meter\nRecords the amount of electrical energy in kilowatt-hours consumed over a certain period\nMain Switch\nUsed to shut off the supply of electricity to the building\nDistribution Panel\nContains fuses or circuit breakers that connect the electrical supply to various loads\nFuses/Circuit Breakers\nProtect conductors from overloads and short circuits\nWire Conductors\nCarry electricity to various circuits throughout the building\nFuses and Circuit Breakers\nSizing\nFuses and circuit breakers are sized according to the wire they protect, and the wire is \nsized according to the load of the individual branch circuits.\nCircuit Limitations\n120 V branch circuits are limited to a maximum number of receptacles and fixtures to \navoid overloading. Some 120 V appliances, such as refrigerators and freezers, require \nseparate circuits and breakers.\nHeating Circuits\nIndividual heating circuits are limited to a maximum wattage rating and have separate \nfuses or breakers.\nHigh-Load Appliances\nElectric ranges, dryers, and hot waters are on separate circuits, protected by high-\namperage fuses or breakers.\nWire Conductors\nBranch Circuit Sizing\nIndividual branch circuits are sized according to the size of \nwire used in the circuit: as more circuits are added, the total \ncurrent increases.\nMost residential lighting and receptacle circuits and other \n120 V circuits are supplied by 14-2 AWG (14-gauge, 2-wire, \nplus bond) conductors. Heating circuits, including most hot \nwater heaters, generally use 12-2 AWG conductors, while \nranges and dryers require much heavier gauge conductors.\nAppliance Wiring\nWire used in the internal wiring of gas-fired appliances will \nfrequently be a lighter (smaller) gauge and is generally of \nthe multi-stranded type of design. Appliances are \nmanufactured in accordance with a particular standard and \nare certified for use with specific wiring. Any repairs to this \nwiring must conform to the same standard.\nExternal wiring must conform to the electrical code adopted \nin the province where the work is being performed.\nWire Size and Ratings\nWire size\nRating (amperage)\nBreaker size (amps)\n#14\n15 A\n15 A\n#12\n20 A\n20 A\n#10\n30 A\n30 A\n#8\n45 A\n40 A\n#6\n65 A\n60 A\n#3\n105 A\n100 A\nAlways refer to the Canadian Electrical Code, Part I (CE Code) and the manufacturer for the correct application of wire and ratings.\nGas Piping System Hazards\nFire and Shock Hazards\nThe gas piping system in a building can create fire and \nshock hazards throughout the building if it is not properly \nbonded to ground\nFault Current Path\nThe piping system can become a path for a fault current \nevent from the electrical system\nEquipotential Bonding\nBonding of conductive pipes and systems is provided to \nprevent them from carrying a voltage different from the \nelectrical system\nMetal Gas Tubing\nThe requirement to provide equipotential bonding to a \nmetal gas piping system is not intended to apply to metal \ngas tubing\nBenefits of Bonding and Grounding\nShock Protection\nProtect persons from electric shock hazards\nShort Circuit Path\nProvides a path for short circuit current\nProperty Protection\nProtect property from damage caused by short circuits and \nlightning\nCircuit Protection\nOpen fuses and circuit breakers when short circuits occur\nInterior gas piping systems are electrically bonded to ground at the electrical panel to prevent possible hazards. Bonding the gas piping \nsystem to ground prevents arcing (sparking) due to electrical potential difference between the piping and ground, reducing the risk of \naccidental ignition.\nPurpose of Fuses and Breakers\nProtection Devices\nThe fuse and the circuit breaker are the two most commonly \nused devices for the protection of electrical systems. The \npurpose of a protective device is to open the electrical \ncircuit, stopping current flow, before damage can be done to \nthe conductors and equipment connected to the circuit.\nKey Differences\nThe difference between fuses and circuit breakers is that:\n•\nFuses are one-time-use only devices and must be \nreplaced when they activate and open\n•\nCircuit breakers can be reset if they trip\nAll fuses and breakers are sized to protect the circuit \nconductors, not the appliances connected to the circuit. \nFuses and breakers must not be oversized.\nFuse and Breaker Applications\nTime-Delay Fuses\nTime-delay fuses should be used to protect inductive type circuits \n(motors) and where intermittent, momentarily high loads will be \nencountered, such as motor and air conditioning circuits.\nCode Specifications\nThe CE Code specifies maximum ampacity values for fuses, breakers, \nand other protective devices.\nManufacturer Details\nEach fuse or breaker manufacturer has specific details of the use and \napplication of electrical circuit protectors. Electrical safety and \nprotective devices are matched to the application to ensure the right \novercurrent protection.\nReplacement Guidelines\nWhen changing a circuit protector, replace it with the same type as \noriginally provided by the manufacturer or consult the manufacturer for \nthe correct replacement.\nSafety Warnings for Circuit \nProtection\nNever change a fuse with the power on!\nAlways disconnect power before replacing fuses to prevent \nelectrical shock\nNever work live unless you are authorized and \nsupervised!\nWorking on energized circuits requires special training and \nauthorization\nUnderstanding Overloads\nAn overload is a moderate increase in current beyond the rated current \nvalue and exposes conductors and equipment to more current than their \ndesign allows.\nA circuit becomes overloaded when the equipment connected to it draws \nmore current than that for which the circuit is designed or rated. The \nheat produced by an overload often causes electrical insulation \ndeterioration and failure. During an overload, t",

The turbine drives a generator, thus transforming its mechanical energy into electrical energy through electromagnetic induction.\nThree-Phase Generation\nAt the power station, an electrical generator converts mechanical power into a set of three alternating electric currents (AC), one from each coil (or winding) of the generator. Three-phase electric power is the most common method used by electrical grids worldwide to transfer power.\nTransmission\nAt the power station, transformers change the voltage from generators to a higher level suitable for transmission in order to minimize losses over long distances.\nDistribution\nOn arrival at a substation, the power is stepped down from transmission level voltage to distribution level voltage. Finally, upon arrival at the service location, the power is stepped down again to the required service voltage(s).\nElectrical Grid Components\nGenerating Stations\nPower plants that produce electrical power through various means such as hydroelectric, nuclear, coal, natural gas, wind, or solar.\nTransmission Lines\nHigh voltage lines that carry power from distant sources to demand centers, minimizing power loss over long distances.\nDistribution Lines\nLower voltage lines that connect individual customers to the grid, delivering power at usable voltages for homes and businesses.\nAn electrical grid is an interconnected network for delivering electricity from producers to consumers. Central power stations became economically practical with the development of AC power transmission, using power transformers to transmit power at high voltage and with low loss.\nBuilding Electrical Supply\nFrom Street Grid to Building\nThe electrical supply to a building comes from the street grid and runs through wire conductors from a transformer located on a utility pole or in another location such as an underground vault.\nConnection to Meter\nThe conductors (supply lines) connect to the building at a meter base installed on the exterior of the building or in a utility room.\nDistribution Within Building\nFrom the meter, power is distributed to various circuits through the main electrical panel, which contains circuit breakers or fuses to protect each circuit.\nUnderstanding Phase in Electrical Power\nPhase can be described as the difference in electrical degrees between two waveforms. Different types of electrical systems use different phase configurations.\nSingle-Phase Power\nSingle-phase electric power refers to the distribution of alternating current electric power using a system in which all the voltages of the supply vary in unison. If you were to graph the magnitude of current or voltage for AC single phase power, you would have a single-line sine wave.\nSingle-phase power comprises two independent voltages that are carried on two separate conductors. The two hot lines are called Line 1 and Line 2.\nThree-Phase Power\nThe power generating station produces three different phases of AC power simultaneously. The three coils within the AC generator are 120 mechanical degrees apart. When the coils are rotating, three different voltages are produced with equal magnitude and frequency values.\nThis allows for higher motor starting torque and lower amperage (current draw) than is possible with a single-phase supply as it is a more constant and consistent power supply.\nSingle-Phase Power System\nTransformer\nA neutral wire connected to the midpoint of the secondary 240 V winding divides it to provide two voltages (120 V and 240 V) on a three-wire system.\nThree-Wire System\nThe system consists of two hot lines (Line 1 and Line 2) and one neutral wire, which is grounded at the transformer and at the electrical panel.\nVoltage Distribution\n120 V supplies small appliances such as televisions, while 240 V supplies larger appliances such as electric ranges.\nResidential Application\nMost residential appliances operate on single-phase voltage, supplied by a transformer with primary and secondary windings.\nThree-Phase Power System\nGeneration\nThe power generating station produces three different phases of AC power simultaneously. The three coils within the AC generator are 120 mechanical degrees apart.\nWhen the coils are rotating, three different voltages are produced with equal magnitude and frequency values.\nAdvantages\nHigher motor starting torque\nLower amperage (current draw)\nMore constant and consistent power supply\nGenerally more economical than equivalent single-phase or two-phase systems at the same voltage\nApplications\nThree-phase power supply is used to power large motors and other heavy loads. Three-phase, three- and four-wire systems are used for industrial and commercial applications.\nThree-Phase System Configuration\nFour-Wire System Components\nThree hot line wires\nA ground wire\nA neutral may also be included, at times\nCommon Supplied Voltages\n120/208 V\n240/416 V\n347/600 V\n600 V\nColor-Coding\nNeutral (when present): White or natural grey\nPhase A (phase wire A): Red\nPhase B (phase wire B): Black\nPhase C (phase wire C): Blue\nPhase Sequence and Neutral Wire\nPhase Sequence\nThe phase sequence, or the phase rotation, is the order in which the three voltages of a three-phase circuit flow one another. The phase sequence can be changed in two ways:\nBy reversing the direction of rotation of the three-phase generator\nBy interchanging the connections of any two of the three hot wires (This method may be necessary to change/correct the rotation of a three-phase motor at initial commissioning)\nNeutral Wire Identification\nThe neutral wire (the identified circuit conductor) must have the same colour throughout the whole length of the circuit it services, for conductor sizes up to No. 2 AWG.\nIdentified circuit conductors larger than No. 2 AWG must be identified at both ends with white tape, unless the conductor is white.\nElectrical Service Rating\n100A\nMinimum New Construction\nThe minimum requirement in most new residential construction\n60A\nOlder Homes\nMany older homes have this service rating\n200A\nElectric Heat\nHomes heated by electricity require this service\nThe electrical service supplied to a building is measured in amps (amperes) or kilowatts, the unit of measurement for electrical current. The amperage rating of a service is the maximum total current draw of all electrical appliances in the building. As more appliances are added, the electrical service may need to be upgraded to a higher amperage rating. This often requires a new, larger capacity distribution panel and may require installation of larger capacity supply lines by the power supply authority.\nComponents of Electrical Service\nService Authority Responsibility\nThe local distribution power supply authority is responsible for the installation, maintenance, and servicing of supply conductors up to the meter base of the customer's building.\nUnderground supply lines enter the meter base through a protective conduit, eliminating the requirement for a service mast and its related hardware.\nThe components of a typical electrical service include the service entrance, meter base, main disconnect, and distribution panel. The configuration may vary between overhead and underground service connections.\nResidential Electrical Distribution System\nElectric Meter\nThe supply wires to a building first pass through an electric meter, which records the amount of electrical energy in kilowatt-hours consumed over a certain period.\nMain Switch\nThe m",

          "content": "Electrical Conductors and Wiring\nThis section explores the fundamentals of electrical conductors, wire types, insulation, and applications in electrical systems. Understanding these components is essential for proper electrical installation and maintenance in residential, commercial, and industrial settings.\nWire Conductors\nSolid Wire Conductors\nSolid copper wire is usually formed by drawing a soft copper rod through a series of doughnutshaped metal blocks called dies. Each successive die has a smaller diameter hole than the previous one. As the copper rod passes through the dies, it is reduced in diameter and becomes longer.\nStranded-Wire Conductors\nA stranded-wire conductor consists of a group of wires that are twisted or braided together, often around a central core. A stranded wire acts as a single conductor, with nearly the same currentcarrying capacity as a single solid wire of the same gauge.\nStranded-wire conductors are usually No. 8 AWG and larger. The wires making up a stranded conductor normally have the same size. The size of the wires depends on the flexibility required - the smaller the diameter of the wire strands, the more flexible the conductor.\nConductor Size (Gauge)\nAmerican Wire Gauge (AWG) Standard\nWire conductors are sized according to the American Wire Gauge (AWG) standard.\nSize Range\nSizes range from No. 44 AWG to No. 4/0 AWG (0000), as shown in the AWG wire conductor sizes table.\nInverse Relationship\nThe smaller the AWG number, the greater the diameter and cross-sectional area of the conductor.\nAWG Wire Conductor Sizes\nAWG No.\nDia.

Ampacity rating depends on the type of cable, its insulation, and the maximum temperature to which the cable will be exposed.\nAWG Size\n60°C (Type TW)\n75°C (Types RW75, TW75)\n90°C (Types R90, TW90, T90)\nConductor Insulation\nPurpose\nPrevent undesirable current flow and protect against electric shock\nCommon Materials\nRubber compounds, polyvinylchloride (PVC), and polyethylene plastic\nPerformance Requirements\nSuitable voltage rating, temperature rating, environmental protection, and mechanical protection\nConductor Insulation Requirements\nVoltage Rating\nA conductor's voltage rating is printed on the insulation.\nElectrical conductor insulation subjected to excessive voltage may break down and lose its insulating ability.\nThe ability of a conductor's insulation to resist breakdown due to voltage stress is its dielectric strength.\nTemperature Rating\nA conductor's temperature rating is printed on its outer surface.\nIf an electrical conductor is used in an application where it is exposed to excessive heat:\nIts insulation may melt or burn, leaving the wire conductors bare\nThe life expectancy of the insulation may be greatly reduced\nStove wire, for example, has a high-temperature-resistant fibre wrapping over the top of its rubber or thermoplastic insulation to protect it from the heat of the appliance it services.\nEnvironmental Considerations for Conductors\nMoisture Resistance\nThe presence of moisture can reduce an insulation's dielectric strength\nChemical Resistance\nCorrosive vapours can damage or destroy insulating materials\nMechanical Protection\nMust provide adequate protection against physical damage\nFire Resistance\nSome applications require special fire-resistant insulation\nCable Types for Different Locations\nCable\nLocation use\nNMD (non-metallic dry)\nFor exposed wiring in dry or damp locations\nFor concealed wiring in dry or damp locations\nNMW (non-metallic wet)\nFor exposed wiring in dry locations and in Category 1 and 2 locations, where not exposed to mechanical damage\nFor exposed wiring in wet locations\nFor concealed wiring in dry locations and in Category 1 and 2 locations where not exposed to mechanical damage\nUnsheathed conductors\nRun outdoors must be enclosed in a code-compliant raceway.\nMechanical Protection for Conductors\nIdentify Potential Hazards\nThe insulation of electrical conductors used in applications where they are exposed to possible physical damage must provide adequate protection.\nSelect Appropriate Protection\nSome conductors have an outer layer of flexible metallic sheathing to protect the conductor and its insulation from damage.\nFollow Code Requirements\nFor example, in order to prevent damage to conductors in locations where steel joists and studs are used as framing members, armoured cable (BX) is typically used however NMD cable is permitted when CE Code Rule 12-516, Protection for cable in concealed installations, is complied with.\nConductor Applications\nPower Circuit Wiring\nElectrical distribution conductors and cabling for residential, commercial, and industrial buildings\nFixture Wiring\nSpecial type of wire approved for use within electrical equipment such as lighting fixtures\nLow-Voltage Control Circuits\nCircuits operating from 31V to 750V inclusive, or extra-low voltage circuits operating at 30V or less\nData Cabling\nProvides sites telecommunication infrastructure, including twisted pair, coaxial, and fiber-optic\nPower Circuit Wiring\nService Equipment\nThe service equipment, which uses the largest conductors, is the main power source for all other circuit wiring in the building.\nService equipment conductors usually require special mechanical protection, in accordance with Section 6 of the CE Code, and any local bulletins.\nBranch Circuits\nBranch circuits supply power to receptacle outlets, lighting, heater units, dryers, ranges, and motorized equipment.\nDepending on the application and CE Code requirements, branch circuits use a variety of conductor types, including:\nNon-metallic sheathed cable\nArmoured cable\nMineral-insulated cable\nThermoplastic and rubber-coated cable\nConductors in conduit\nFixture Wiring\nDefinition\nFixture wire is a special type of wire approved for use within electrical equipment such as lighting fixtures. It is usually a stranded, flexible conductor with high-temperature rated insulation.\nUsage\nThis wire, also known as equipment wire, is used to connect internal fixtures to branch circuit conductors.\nCharacteristics\nTypically stranded for flexibility\nHigh temperature rating for use in lighting fixtures\nSpecialized insulation for specific applications\nLow Voltage Control Circuits\n1\nLow Voltage Circuits\nThe CE Code defines low voltage circuits as those operating from 31V to 750V inclusive\nMotor Control Circuits\nSome motor control circuits operate at 600V\nExtra-Low Voltage Circuits\nOperate at 30V or less\nResidential Applications\nThermostat, gas valve, and zone valve control circuits\nData Cabling\nData cables and associated hardware provide sites telecommunication infrastructure. Modern gas equipment is often equipped with network interface devices (NID) to enable them to connect to local area networks (LAN).\nTwisted Pair\nOften used in data networks for short and medium length connections because of its relatively lower costs compared to optical fibre and coaxial cable.\nCoaxial\nUsed for longer runs and applications requiring greater bandwidth and noise immunity.\nFibre-Optic\nUsed for high-speed, long-distance data transmission with complete electrical isolation.\nTwisted Pair Cabling\nUnshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)\nThe most common cable used in computer networking as the twisting of pair of conductors in the cable provide shielding from electromagnetic interference.\nShielded Twisted Pair (STP)\nAdditional shielding from high-frequency signals applied to individual pairs with foil and/or braided metal fibre.\nScreened Twisted Pair (ScTP)\nShield applied to a collection of pairs for protection against electromagnetic interference in high-noise environments.\nConductor Colour Codes\nThe wires of electrical conductors must be marked for easy identification so they can be correctly connected in circuits. There are several different methods used to differentiate wiring.\nCommon Marking Methods\nThe insulation of each wire is a different colour\nThe insulation of each conductor may have an attached label marker or wire number (larger cables have a coloured strip)\nStandard Colour Codes\nColour\nUse\nWhite or grey\nOnly for insulated, neutral conductors or identified conductors\nGreen\nOnly for insulated grounding or bonding conductors\nRed, black, and blue\nTypically identifies live (ungrounded) conductors\nNon-metallic Sheathed Cable (NMSC and NMD)\nDescription\nNon-metallic sheathed cable usually has PVC or polyethylene plastic insulation, which also serves as the outer covering of the cable. This type of cable is most commonly used for wiring branch circuits.\nCautions\nThe non-metallic covering of electric cables can burn and may transmit fire when ignited\nBurning non-metallic coverings may emit highly toxic gases that generate dense smoke\nAcidic gas emissions may corrode metals in the vicinity of the cable",

In many cases, \nthese problems will be electrical ones. Solving these problems requires a thorough knowledge of \nthe system and the tools required to determine where the problems lie. This means that the gas \ntechnician/fitter must be familiar with the various types of electrical measuring and test devices, \nas well as how and where they are applied. \nWhen working with electrical testing equipment, gas technicians/fitters must protect themselves \nfrom electrical hazards. Reviewing Unit 1 Safety is recommended. \nFor information on the basic selection, use, and maintenance of common electrical testing and \nmeasuring instruments, refer to Unit 5 Introduction to electricity, Chapter 7. Electrical measuring \ninstruments. \nObjectives \nAt the end of this chapter, you will be able to: \ndescribe the types and applications of measuring and test instruments; and \n• describe the safe operation and connection of measuring and test instruments. \nTerminology \nTenn \nAbbreviation Definition \n(Symbol) \nDigital multimeter \nDMM \nDigital electronic measuring instrument that \ncombines several functions in one unit \nVolt-0hm-milliammeter \nVOM \nElectronic measuring instrument that combines \nseveral functions in one unit \nTypes and applications of measuring and test \ninstruments \nElectrical measuring and test instruments include various types of meters. recorders, and \nanalyzers. These instruments may be analogue or digital-type units (Figure 3-1 ). \nAnalogue instruments indicate measured values with a scale and pointer display. The pointer's \nmovement is directly and continuously related to the measured quantity. \nDigital instruments interpret the measured quantity electronically in discrete numerical data \n(digits). They have a numerical display that is formed by light-€mitting diodes (LEDs) or liquid \ncrystal displays (LCDs).\nFigure 3-1 \nDigital and analog multimeters \nCourtesy of Camosun College, BC Campus Open Textbook, licenced under CC BY \nWe will focus on the digital multimeter (DMM) as it is the most common type in use today. \nAs discussed in Unit 2 Fasteners, tools, and testing instruments and in Unit 5 Introduction to \nelectricity, a digital multimeter (DMM) combines the functions of a voltmeter, an ammeter, and an \nohmmeter. Digital multimeters also have advanced features that vary among DMM models from \ndifferent manufacturers. \nFigure 3-2 \nField service gas technician's/fitter's multimeter \nCourtesy of Camosun College, BC Campus Open Textbook, licenced under CC BY \nOig~al display \nFunction dial \nInput jacks \nC:l \n---\n• --\n. .,.. -·-\n--\n-• \n.. \n· • -\n~ -\n...1.-• \n--\n' \n·-\n-: -\n-: -\nI \n,,. -\n/ \nProbe loads \nThe function dial normally has positions that will allow a technician to measure AC volts, DC \nvolts, DC amps, and resistance. In addition, some DMMs have function switch positions that will\nallow a technician to measure AC amps and to test diodes and capacitors. Some DMMs require \nmanual selling of ranges, and others have an autoranging feature. \nVoltage functions \nElectrical potential and voltage are measured in volts Mor millivolts (mV). \nThe voltage function measures the difference in electric potential between two points in a circuit. \nThere are two types of voltage sources, AC voltage and DC voltage. The current flow caused by \nan AC voltage source changes in both magnitude and direction at regular intervals. The current \nflow caused by a DC voltage source does not change direction. The AC voltage function is \ncommonly used to test and troubleshoot receptacles, gas appliance power supply, transformers, \nand other AC control circuits. A DMM set for the DC voltage function can be used to test battery \nbanks and to troubleshoot DC motors, DC generators and other DC circuits \nMillivolt function \nSome DMM may have a dedicated DC millivolt setting that is more accurate than the DC \nautorange voltage function. This function is useful for testing very low millivolt systems such as \nthermocouples. \nAmmeter function \nElectric current flow is measured in amperes (A), milliamperes (mA), or microamperes (µA). The \nword •ampere• is commonly shortened to •amp\". So, for example, a milliampere would be called \na milliamp. The DMM has a setting for AC and DC current. Most DMMs can measure DC or AC \ncurrents from the micro-amp range to a maximum of 10 amps. For higher amperage circuits, a \nclamp-on ammeter is recommended. \nClamp-on ammeter \nClamp-on ammeters (Figure 3-3) are designed to eliminate the need to interrupt circuit operation \nto measure current in the circuit. Clamp-0n meters are generally used to measure alternating \ncurrent or direct current only, but some digital clamp-on meters will measure ac and de, as well as \nvoltage and resistance. \nA clamp-on ammeter has the following advantages: \nIt causes minimal circuit loading because it is not connected in series with the load. \nIt does not require the use of external shunts, as some in-line ammeters do. \nIt is generally more rugged than an in-line ammeter.\nFigure 3-3 \nClamp meter \nCourtesy of The Industry Training Authority \nOhmmeter function \nAny circuit with an ability to conduct some electrical current is said to have electrical continuity. \nThe amount of resistance there is to current flow is measured in ohms (Q) or kilohms (kO). \nThe ohmmeter function can be used to measure both resistance and continuity in a circuit. \nAn ohmmeter function is powered by a small battery that causes current flow through the tested \ncircuit's resistance, therefore a DMM set for ohms must not be used on an energized circuit. A \nDMM set for ohms can be used to test the continuity of a fuse or a switch. The resistance of an \nopen switch or faulty fuse would indicate OL (infinity) on the display, and a closed switch or good \nfuse would indicate a very small resistance value on the display. \nSpecialized meters \nIn addition to the basic meters, gas technicians/fitters may often be required to use other \ninstruments such as: \n• megohmmeters (meggers) -for measuring insulation resistance; and \n• capacitor analyzers -\nfor measuring actual capacitance values. \nMegohmmeter \nAn Insulation resistance tester also called a megohmmeter (Figure 3-4) is used for measuring the \nresistance of electrical insulation in, for example, motor and transformer windings. It measures \nvalues in the 20 kilohm to 2000 megohm range. \nThe component or apparatus being tested is disconnected from the circuit and the megohmmeter \nleads connected (one to the frame and one to the windings). The instrument applies a de voltage \nto the component, and the insulation value is read at 30 seconds and again at 1 minute after\noeIng connecteo. Ir me InsuIauon Is in 9000 conomon, me vaIue wm increase sIowiy. 1 ne reaomg \ntaken at 1 minute should be higher than the one taken at 30 seconds. \nFigure 3-4 \nMegohm meter \nCourtesy of Megger ltd, licenced under CC BY \nCapacitor analyzer \nUnlike an ohmmeter, which only indicates if a capacitor has capacitance, a capacitor analyzer \ncan test actual capacitance. Its principal function is the detection of current leakage that would \nnormally only be obvious during circuit operation. It can also detect if a capacitor is open or \nshorted-out. \nCapacitor testers come in many different types and designs. Stand-alone testers may have a \ndigital read-out or bar graph, while some just have LED indicators. Frequently, digital multimeters \nnow have the ability to test most capacitors used with gas-fired equipment. \nOperation and connection of measuring and test \ninstruments \nA gas technician/fitter must be able to identify various electrical test and measuring instruments, \nselect the appropriate instrument for the job, and operate it correctly. This is covered in detail in \nUnit 5 Introduction to electricity, Chapter 7. Electrical measuring instruments. \nBefore a gas technician/fitter performs any tests on electrical equipment, he or she must have a \nthorough knowledge of electrical safety and the equipment being used. Nways read the \nmanufacturer's operation and maintenance instructions for testing instruments and equipment \nprior to use. It you are unsure of how to use them, contact your supervisor for clarification. \nImportant: \nSafety is the single most important concern when working on electrical equipment. \nAll workers must be trained to use the equipment in analyzing or troubleshooting problems with \ngas-fired systems. Never work on live electrical unless you have been trained and authorized \nby your employer. \nAlways wear the required personal protective equipment.\nBefore you begin \nYou must be aware of the following factors: \nthe presence of electricity: \n-\nNever trust that the power has been switched off. \n- Nways measure the voltage before working on any equipment or wiring. \n-\nEven electrical switches and disconnects can fail in the on (circuit closed) position when the \ntoggle or arm has been moved to the off (circuit open) position. \nlockout/tag out procedures; \ngrounding procedures; \nsystem potential energy or category of short-circuit current; \ncondition of electrical meter: \n-\nInspect for visible damage. \n-\nVisually inspect the test lead insulation, probe, and connection. \n-\nPerform a resistance test of the leads to confirm they are reliable and well connected. \ninspect condition of electrical meter: \n- Nways measure the voltage before. \nthe zero adjustment; and \ntesting of a meter and leads on a known source before using them to test a circuit or \ncomponent to ensure that the meter is working properly. \nUsingaDMM \nThe use of a digital multimeter (VOM) is detailed in Unit 5 Introduction to electricity, Chapter 7. \nElectrical measuring instruments. \nMeasuring voltage, current, and resistance \nMeasuring voltage \nTo measure voltage, a voltmeter must be connected across the two points in the circuit where the \nvoltage appears.

The service conductors consist of: \n-\ntwo (live) conductors or \"line wires\"; and \n-\na neutral conductor. \nThere is also a separate grounding conductor that connects the neutral and the metal distribution \npanel to a grounding electrode. The neutral is permitted to be grounded only once. \nBranch circuits \nThe 240 V supply coming into a building is divided into branch circuits at the distribution panel \n(Figure 4-1 ). \nBranch circuits are 240 V or 120 V, depending on the characteristics of the circuit they supply.\nAt the panel ... \nAre protected by ... \nBranch circuits have ... \nThe 240 V \nTwo-pole breakers \n- •A double overcurrent that feeds two ungrounded \ncircuits \n(live) branch circuit conductors coming into the \npanel \n- May or may not have a neutral conductor \n- A bonding conductor (cable or non-metallic \nraceway) connected to metallic panel box by \nmeans of a bonding bus \nThe 120V \nSingle-pole breakers - A single overcurrent that feeds an ungrounded \ncircuits \n(live) branch circuit conductor coming into the \npanel \n- An identified conductor from the neutral bar in the \npanel \n- A bonding conductor (cable or non-metallic \nraceway)connected to metallic panel box by \nmeans of a bonding bus \nAll line-voltage circuits must have a continuous bond running from the main distribution panel to \neach junction box, receptacle, and appliance. The CE Code states that non-current-carrying \nconductive parts of electrical equipment shall be connected to a bonding conductor. \n• As can be seen in Figure 4-1, 240 V branch circuits may have a neutral conductor included in the wiring \nrun. This is necessary if the equipment has any 120 V components (e.g., lights).\nFigure 4-1 \nCombination panel and schematic, showing branch circuit connections \n'Jon1t.\"'-'I j;i.11,d 1110U'llit!l(dc-,k(' \n-\nw \n@@©©©©@©~ \nl()Sf1t(nl \ncroundinc \"'I!<:~ \nfl(in(&\\&b•is \nControl circuit transformers \nJ \n' \ns \nI \n• \nu \nu ·~ \n17 .. \nflol~COtltl..:tor \njb.,1!,'(l!il\"'IU~) \n' ,-... __ 120V \n• \n• • \n'\" \n\" \n,..... : --),.,v \n,..... __ \n,. \n\" \n\" ,. \nSome gas appliance control circuits and other electrical devices operate at lower voltages than \n120 V. The voltage for control devices is usually 24 V AC (typical residential appliance control \nvoltage). A 240/24 or 120/24 step-down transformer is required to obtain the necessary 24 V \nsupply. \nA typical step-down transformer is shown in Figure 4-2.\nFigure 4-2 \nTypical step-down transformer and schematic \nCourtesy of Terry Bell \n:'/ :,: ,:_:_:_:_.-,:_:_:_.-/·, \n' 1 \n\" ' \n.,1, \n•11• \n.... \n. ... \n120 V \n' \"-\n;;;·, \nN.: \nPrimnry \nc;::::;: \npower \nwinding \n... \n\"\"'1CC \n-\n.. \n' \n'••· \nN (L2) \nI \n11 \nlot I \n-:-~:~ ~ ~ ~~~~ ~ £,:• ,' \nA transformer like the one shown in Figure 4-2 consists of: \na core of iron plates separated by insulation; \na primary winding; and \na secondary winding. \n,,.-Elccttomagnc:lie \nfield \nSecondary \nwinding \nl> \nIron \ncore \n2 4V \nThe 120 V supply is connected to the primary winding terminals of the transformer and the \nappliance control circuit connected to the 24 V secondary winding terminals. The 120 V \nalternating current flow through the primary winding induces a 24 V current in the secondary \nwinding to power the appliance control circuit. \nIt is important to make sure transformers are bonded by a bonding conductor to the cabinet bond. \nThis is critical for troubleshooting. \nT ransfonner ratings \nManufacturers always specify the voltage rating of a transformer's primary and secondary \nwindings. Secondary winding rated voltages are specified for full-load conditions with the rated \nprimary voltage.\nOperating a transformer's primary at higher than rated voltage may cause the transformer to \noverheat, damaging its insulation. Operating the primary at lower than rated voltage does no \nharm, but secondary voltages will be less than rated values. \nCurrent ratings are generally specified for secondary windings only. If the secondary current \nrating is not exceeded, the primary current capacity cannot be exceeded. \nTransformer ratings are based on the amount of power the secondary winding can handle. \nTransformer power ratings can be specified in two ways: \nby the volt-ampere (YA) rating; and \n-\nby the power rating in watts. \nThe volt-ampere rating of a transformer is the product of the voltage and amperage (YA = V x A). \nA power rating specified in watts is understood to be the power that a transformer can deliver to a \nresistive load. The power rating in watts is the product of the current rating and the voltage rating \nof the secondary winding (P = E x I). \nSome transformers are fused internally. If there is no indication of fusing, it is good practice to \ninclude fusing when replacing or installing new transformers. New equipment usually has the \ntransformer integral to the main circuit board, which may be equipped with a fuse. \nTransformers are indicated on electrical diagrams in two ways, as shown in Figure 4-3. \nFigure 4-3 \nElectrical diagram transformer symbols \nElectrical hardware \n-\nLI \nPrimary \n(hOl ) \n-\nN<Lz) \n-\n-\nSecond ary \nIn order to property install and service gas appliances and equipment, gas technicians/fitters \nmust be able to identify and use the following types of electrical hardware: \nconnection devices; \nswitches, relays, and contactors; \nboxes; \nsockets and plugs; \nfasteners; and \nconduit or raceways.\nConnection devices \nThe CE Code requires that all connections be made only in outlet or junction boxes. The \nelectrical connections used for the installation of gas appliances and equipment fall into two basic \ngroups: \nsolderless terminals and insulators; and \n• soldered connections. \nSolderless tenninals and insulators \nSolderless terminals and insulators include crimp-on-type and insulated cap-type connectors. \nCrimp-on connectors \nCrimp-on connectors are used to secure twisted and untwisted wire joints. This type of connector \ncan be a slip-on metal cap for pig-tail joints, or a metal sleeve for splicing two straight wires. The \ntwo-part connector (Figure 4-4) has a conductor retaining sleeve that is compressed by using \nspecial crimping pliers and an insulated screw cap into which the crimped retainer is inserted. \nFigure 4-4 \nCrimp-on connector and pliers \nCourtesy of Camosun College, BC Campus Open Textbook, licenced under CC BY \nInsulated cap connectors \nThere are several types of insulated-cap connectors. Also known as wire nut connectors or \nmarrettes by the manufacturer Marr. This type of connector is used for pig-tail joints of two or \nmore conductors. \nThe two most common insulated-cap connectors are the twist-on type and the set-screw type \n(Figure 4-5). They are both available in several colour coded sizes to accommodate a wide range \nof conductors. \nThe set-screw connectors consist of a brass connector body and an insulated cap. The twisted \nconductors are slid into the brass connector body and secured with the hold-down screw before \nthe plastic insulating cap is screwed in place. \nTwist-on connectors have a cone-shaped coiled wire insert that grips the twisted conductors to \nensure good electrical contact. When the connector is twisted onto the stripped end of the wires, \nthe wire is drawn and squeezed into the metal insert.\nFigure 4-5 \nInsulated cap connectors \nSet·screw insulated cap \nTwist-on insulated cap \nFollow the instructions that are included with each type of connector to ensure the connector is \ncorrectly joining the wire. \nIt is good practice to check these connectors periodically to tighten them if required since \nexpansion and contraction loosen them over time. \nModular connectors \nModular connectors were originally designed for use in telephone wiring but have since been \nused for many other purposes. Many applications that originally used a bulkier, more expensive \nconnector have converted to modular connectors. Probably the best-known applications of \nmodular connectors are for telephone and Ethernet. \nModular connectors are designed to latch together.

Millivolt systems \nOverview \nPurpose \nMany gas-fired appliances are considered self-contained or self-powered. It is very common to \nencounter appliances equipped with devices that generate electricity and that have components \nthat operate on direct current millivolt. This voltage is generated using heat from the gas flame \nand is used to operate minor control and safety circuits and extended systems, especially in off-\ngrid applications. \nThe gas technician/fitter must have complete knowledge of how this voltage is generated as well \nas the amount of voltage that is generated. The gas technician/fitter must also know how this \nvoltage is distributed through the circuit and the test procedures used to isolate problems when \nSeptember 2020 \n111\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 12 \nBasic electricity for gas-fired equipment \nthey arise. The electrical principles remain the same, but millivolt systems have very specific \napplications and restrictions. \nObjectives \nAt the end of this chapter, you will be able to: \n• explain the generation of de millivolt systems; \n• explain the procedure used to test control circuits; and \n• describe millivolt thermostats. \nTerminology \nTerm \nAbbreviation \nDefinition \n(Symbol) \nMillivolts \nmV \nA millivolt is 1/1000 of a volt \nPowerpile \nConsists of multiple thermocouples joined \ntogether at one end and connected in series to \ngenerate more voltage than a single \nThermocouple \nSensor used to measure temperature \nThermopile \nSee Powerpile. \nGeneration of small-value DC voltages \nUnlike alternating current (AC), direct current flows in one direction only. Direct current (DC) is \nused in many different applications in North America. \nIt is normally used to power electronic devices, control relays on most building automation \nsystems, small appliances, automotive electrical systems, and, recently, solar panels. DC is often \nsupplied by some form of battery or power supply converter. However, other means, such as \nheating a bimetallic device called a thermocouple, can generate small de voltages. \nThermocouple \nA simple thermocouple consists of two wires, made of dissimilar (different) metals joined together \nat one end. The end at which they are joined is called the hot junction, while the opposite end is \nthe cold junction. \nWhen sufficient heat is applied to the hot junction of a thermocouple, a small voltage is generated \nat the cold junction, causing a positive-to-negative direct current flow. If the cold junction is \nheated, current will flow in the opposite direction (negative-to-positive). The voltage generated is \nso small that it is measured in millivolts (mV). A millivolt is 1/1000 of a volt. Thermocouples \ngenerate voltages in the 0-30 mV range. \nSome thermocouples consist of a wire located in the centre of a small, circular metal tube. The \ntube and wire, which are made of dissimilar (different) metals, are joined at one end to form the \nhot junction (the opposite end is the cold junction). \n112 \nSeptember 2020\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 12 \nBasic electricity for gas-fired equipment \n'Thertnocouple application \nThermocouples are used as a flame detection device or flame safeguard on appliances that have \nconstant pilots. They are also used on appliances with manual reset controls. The thermocouple \nshown in Figure 5-1 is an integral part of a combustion safety circuit for a gas furnace. The \nthermocouple assembly is attached with a threaded male fitting, as shown in Figure 5-1. \nWhen the pilot burner heats the hot junction, the thermocouple generates a voltage to power the \nelectromagnet coil in the safety shut-off valve or safety switch. As long as the pilot remains lit, the \nspring-loaded solenoid shut-off valve or safety switch will remain open to allow the flow of gas to \nthe main and pilot burners. The pilot stays on constantly, but the main valve still requires a \nseparate control circuit and voltage to operate (i.e., a 24 V supply and thermostat). If the pilot light \ngoes out, the thermocouple will cool down, and the resulting drop in voltage will be unable to \nenergize the electromagnetic coil. The spring-loaded safety switch or shut off valve will then shut \noff the flow of gas. \nMost thermocouples supply only a small current in milliamps that is just enough to energize a \nvery small electromagnetic solenoid. \nFigure 5-1 \nCombustion safety circuit thermocouple \nII \nII \n11 \n11 \nI I \nDissimilar \n1 1 \nmetal strips \n1 1 \nCasing \nLeads \nWelded \nconstruction \nHot junction \nContact(+) \nInsulation \nconnection \nnut (male) \nIn order to meet the requirements of CSA B149.1, when a pilot fails (goes out), the thermocouple \nmust cool down and de-energize the safety shut-off valve or safety switch within 90 seconds. \nFor this reason, thermocouples are only approved for use with gas appliances with inputs up to \nand including 400 000 British thermal units per hour (Btu/h) (117 kW). \nHowever, there is an exception to this rule. A single thermocouple may be used to supervise \ninputs of natural gas appliances with inputs of up to 1 000 000 Btu/h (300 kW) if they have \nunrestricted vertical flue passes. Appliances with a specific gravity greater than air (such as \npropane) shall have a maximum flame response time of 20 seconds. These appliances will be \nequipped with fast response thermocouples (Figure 5-2). As many of these appliances, such as \nSeptember 2020 \n113\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 12 \nBasic electricity for gas-fired equipment \nfireplaces, are convertible for either fuel, this is the type of thermocouple that has become \nprevalent. \nFigure 5-2 \nFast response thermocouple \nHot junction \nThe thermocouple only generates a voltage if the temperature difference between the hot and \ncold junctions is at least 400°F (204 °C). \nThe greater the temperature difference, the greater the voltage generated. For this reason, it is \nimportant that the pilot flame heat only the first 0.375 to 0.5 inch (10 mm to 13 mm) of the hot \njunction -\nno other part of the thermocouple should be heated. \nCold junction \nOne of the ends of the cold junction is connected to the copper outer sleeve of the thermocouple, \ncreating one of the conductors of the supply circuit. While the other lead from the cold junction is \nconnected to an insulated wire enclosed in the copper sleeve, which terminates at a coaxial \nconnection that is connected to the safety switch or safety shut-off valve. \nPowerpile generator \nA powerpile, also known as a thermopile, consists of multiple thermocouples joined together at \none end and connected in series to generate more voltage than a single thermocouple (Figure 5-\n3). The total voltage generated by a thermopile is the sum of the voltages generated by each \nthermocouple it contains. \nMost modern thermopiles consist of 10 to 30 thermocouples connected in series. \nPowerpile output ranges from 250 to 750 mV, which allows the powerpile to power an appliance's \ncombustion safety circuit and its control circuit. \nPowerpile generators (Figure 5-4) are used on appliances with automatic-type controls. \nPilot/powerpile generators, as they are called, generate electrical direct current power from the \nflame of a single pilot source. This makes the appliance self-sufficient for stand-alone \napplications. \n114 \nSeptember 2020\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 12 \nBasic electricity for gas-fired equipment \nPo'\\verpile types \nTwo types of powerpile are shown in Figure 5-4: \n• coaxial (on the left); and \n• two wire (on the right). \nA coaxial powerpile looks like a thermocouple; however, its hot junction and contact end are \nlarger. A two-wire powerpile has two cold junction leads that are covered with protective armour. \nSome have the same connecting nut as a thermocouple. \nCol:! \njunctions \nTh1eaded \nbase --=-:1 \nInner \nw i1e \nlead \nSeptember 2020 \nCopper \nHot \njunctions \nFigure 5-3 \nPowerpile schematic \nHot junctions \nCold junctions \nLoad \nFigure 5-4 \nPowerpile generators \nThermopi le \ncontact \nCapillaiy \nHot -------\njunctions \nProtective \narmoured \ncoating \nThermopile leads \n115\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 12 \nBasic electricity for gas-fired equipment \nPilot flan--ie characteristics \nIn order for a powerpile to operate properly, the pilot flame must have certain characteristics.

This may include instructions \nfor connecting the motor to a source of supply, reversing the direction of rotation, lubricating the \nmotor, or operating it safely. \nConstruction and operation of electric motors \nAll electric motors have a similar basic structure. They have two main parts (Figure 6-2): \n• stator ( or frame); and \n• rotor. \nSeptember 2020 \n141\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 12 \nBasic electricity for gas-fired equipment \nFigure 6-2 \nStator and rotor of an electric motor \nStator \nRotor \nStator \nThe stator is stationary, consisting of two or more electromagnets and their windings. It is usually \ncylindrical in shape, with the field poles facing and projecting their magnetic fields into the centre \nspace of the cylinder. The windings are connected to a source of AC, which causes the poles to \nchange polarity in step with the changing direction of the AC. \nRotor \nThe rotor is mounted on a rotating shaft in the centre of the stator. It has a laminated iron core \ncontaining aluminum (sometimes copper) rods or bars along its outer surface. The rods or bars \nare almost parallel to the rotor shaft and serve as the conductors through which current flows. \n(Note that the rotors of most induction motors do not contain windings.) \nAt the ends of the rotor are rings connecting the rods or bars together, completing the current \npaths. The bars and rings look like a squirrel cage. The direction of current flow in some bars will \nbe opposite of that in others. As the rotor turns, the bars swing across magnetic fields created by \nthe stator poles, inducing current in them (Figure 6-3). \nFigure 6-4 shows how the current in each of the rotor's copper rod sets up a magnetic field \naround the wire that interacts with the magnetic field created by the stator poles. The direction of \ncurrent flow in the conductor is indicated by: \n• a cross sign (x) for current away from you (or the tail feathers of an arrow); and \n• a dot (•)for current towards you (the head of an arrow). \n142 \nSeptember 2020\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 12 \nBasic electricity for gas-fired equipment \nFigure 6-3 \nCurrent-carrying conductor in magnetic field \nFigure 6-4 \nCurrent-carrying conductor in magnetic field \nFlux anund conductor \nMotion up-\ncunent away from you \nField flux \nMotion down-\ncunent toward you \nThe magnetic lines of force set up by the current in the conductor will be in opposite directions \nabove and below the conductor. This magnetic field interacts with the magnetic field of the stator \npoles. Since \"like\" magnetic lines repel each other, and \"unlike\" fields attract each other, the rotor \nstarts to turn inside the stator. \nFigure 6-5 shows the forces produced by opposite currents in bars on both sides of the rotor, \ncausing the torque that makes the rotor rotate. The polarity changes when AC current is applied \nto the bars, constantly changing the attraction and repulsion forces causing a continuous rotation \nor spinning motion. \nSeptember 2020 \n143\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 12 \nBasic electricity for gas-fired equipment \nFigure 6-5 \nInteracting magnetic forces cause rotation \nRotar bar \nN \ns \nRo tar bar \nThe frequency of the current change determines the motor speed. Typical AC power is supplied \nat 60 hertz (Hz or cycles per second), so the rotor of a motor with two poles would turn 60 times \nevery second, or 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM). The more poles a motor has, the slower the \nmotor will turn. \nYou can use the following formula to determine the synchronous speed (without load) of motors \nin RPM: \nFrequency x 120 \nRPM=-----\nnumber of poles \nThis calculation would give theoretical motor speed. Internal motor friction and the mechanisms \nor drives to which the motor is connected would affect the actual speed, adding a certain amount \nof resistance to rotation. The difference between the motor-calculated speed and the actual \nspeed is referred to as motor slip. Excessive motor slip can indicate improper motor lubrication, \ndefective motor bearings, poorly adjusted belts (too tight), or an improperly selected motor for the \ndesired application (overload). \nOperation and application of three-phase motors \nThe electric motor changes electric energy into mechanical energy.

In a parallel circuit, components are connected across the same voltage source and can operate independently; failure of one doesn't affect others. In gas-fired equipment, parallel circuits allow independent control of components like fans and ignitors.\nSafety Switches: These are fail-safe mechanisms that shut off power or gas flow when unsafe conditions are detected (e.g., high temperature, blocked flue, or open blower door). They prevent system damage and hazards like fires or explosions.\nFlame Sensor: Detects the presence of a flame using flame rectification (the ability of flame to conduct current). Dirt, oxidation, or poor grounding can cause malfunction. Cleaning or replacing the sensor typically resolves issues.\nCommon Problems:\nLoose connections: Cause intermittent operation; fixed by inspecting and tightening terminals.\nBlown fuse: Stops the control circuit; diagnosed via multimeter and replaced.\nFaulty thermostat: Misreads temperature; tested by bypassing or substituting.\nPart C: Calculation\na) I=VR=24V48Ω=0.5AI = \\frac{V}{R} = \\frac{24V}{48\\Omega} = 0.5AI=RV​=48Ω24V​=0.5A\nb) Power = Voltage × Current ⇒ Current = Power / Voltage\nI=6W24V=0.25AI = \\frac{6W}{24V} = 0.25AI=24V6W​=0.25A\nTotal current draw = 0.5A + 0.25A = 0.75A",

The millivolt system and components may be checked with a voltmeter having a range of 0 – 1000 mV.\nNote: Each step must be signed off by the instructor before proceeding to the next question. Skipped sign offs will result in lost marks (5 per). Any damage to the systems components due to negligence or horseplay will result in a mark of zero for the practical.\nFollow all shop safety rules.\nNeatly, with components labeled, convert the below wiring diagram into a ladder diagram in the space provided (8 marks). Then wire your simulation board using the schematic you created. Verify with the instructor when completed. (4 marks)\nSign off: ____________________\nUsing the reference table and valve layout below, conduct each of the following measurements to the appropriate terminals and verify your readings.\nHave the thermostat contacts open and pilostat knob turned to the off position. Coil resistance should be around 2.25 ohms. If not, replace the valve.\nThe system resistance from the remote switch or thermostat and lead wires should not exceed 1.7 ohms. If greater, reduce the resistance by reducing the thermostat run length, use a larger gauge wire, or replace the thermostat.\nWith the pilostat knob turned to “Pilot” and the thermostat open, push down the pilot valve button and ignite the pilot flame with the piezo ignitor. There should be a minimum of 325 mV. If not, inspect the position of the thermopile in the flame and the cleanliness of thermopile. If both are adequate, replace the thermopile.\nWith the pilostat knob left in the “Pilot” position and pilot still burning, close the thermostat contacts. The thermopile should provide at least 100 mV. If not, replace the thermopile. If the input is at least 100 mV, the valve operator will make an audible click inside the valve when it engages. If the valve does not make a sound, replace it.\nIf you are unsure how to make the readings, ASK! Indicate your readings below: (4 marks)\nExplain how to perform an open-circuit, closed-circuit and drop-out test on a thermocouple. Also provide the expected measurements associated with each test.
