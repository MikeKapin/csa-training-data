The type of work conducted at a G.3 (GF-B1) level requires only a general understanding of venting systems and their components.\n\nTypes of gas vents\n\nSince there are many types of gas-fired appliances, a single type of gas vent is not suitable for all appliance types. CSA B149.1, engineering practices, and manufacturer specifications indicate the appropriate vent for each appliance.\n\nA thorough understanding of the following vent types ensures proper and safe venting:\n• Chimney\n• Type A vents\n• Type B vents (including BW and L vents)\n• Single-wall vent connectors (also known as Type C vents)\n• Type BH vents (special metallic or plastic pipe vents)\n\nThe first four vent types are mainly used for natural-draft venting systems, although some induced mechanical-draft venting systems employ Type B vents or Type C vents. Type BH vents are primarily used for mechanical-draft venting, but balanced-flue natural-draft appliances may also use special venting systems.\n\nChimneys\nChimneys are commonly used to vent oil, solid fuel, or gas appliances with flue temperatures exceeding 470 °F (243 °C). Due to the high temperatures, these vents are made of heat-resistant materials like masonry (brick or concrete) or insulated metal.\n\nChimney liners\nWhen solid-fuel or oil appliances are converted to gas-fired appliances that do not produce high flue temperatures, the chimney may need to be modified.\n\nSolid-fuel or oil appliances produce high-temperature flue gases and a strong draft, with the cold brick walls offering little resistance to this high-temperature draft. However, the flue gas temperature produced by gas-fired appliances is not as hot, and the draft is drastically reduced. In some cases, these flue gases may stop and collect in the chimney, even to the point where a backdraft is produced.\n\nAn additional challenge when converting appliances is the risk of condensation and the vent corrosion it causes. Large cold chimneys require large amounts of heat to warm them enough to stop condensation. Gas-fired appliances may not provide enough heat to restrict condensation.\n\nCorrosion occurs when condensed H2O mixes with CO2 and forms carbonic acid, which attacks the brick, chimney liner, and concrete, accelerating their deterioration.\n\nFor these reasons, you may need to modify unlined chimneys (as per CSA B149.1 — all chimneys must be lined for use with gas-fired appliances) and chimneys with clay tile liners with a liner that both reduces the inside diameter and restricts condensation. Liners are made of rigid materials such as clay or ceramic tile, rigid metal, or flexible metal.\n\nType A vent\nIn the oil and solid fuel industries, a Type A vent is known as a chimney suitable for flue temperatures up to 1000 °F (540 °C). Also known as triple-wall, all-fuel, solid pack, or insulated vent pipe, it is used for venting appliances that burn wood, pellets, coal, oil, propane, and natural gas. When installed on the exterior of a building, it helps to retain the heat in the venting system.\n\nA Type A vent is constructed with a stainless steel interior, a stainless or galvanized steel exterior, and insulation between the walls.\n\nType B vent\nType B vents are only approved for handling low-temperature gases from gas appliances. They have a double-wall construction that encloses an insulating (\"dead air\") space. The outer wall is galvanized metal, and the inner wall is aluminum.\n\nSince the insulating quality of a Type B vent is less than that of a Type A vent, it must be placed inside an insulated structure up to the roofline to avoid low outdoor temperatures that can reduce the temperature of flue gases and reduce the effectiveness of venting action. Additionally, a Type B vent must be placed at least 1 in (2.5 mm) away from combustible materials, following the manufacturer's instructions and the CSA B149.1 code.\n\nType BW vent\nA Type BW vent is similar in construction to a Type B vent, except that it is oval, not round. A Type BW vent is approved for recessed wall furnaces where you can install the oval shape inside a 2 × 4 stud wall.\n\nType L vent\nA Type L vent is very similar to a Type B vent, except the inner wall is made of stainless steel, which makes the vent more resistant to heat and corrosion.\n\nYou may use a Type L vent instead of a Type B vent; however, Type L is more expensive. As a consequence, they are usually only installed when specified by the manufacturer (for example, in a combination gas or oil appliance where heat or corrosion may be a problem).\n\nSingle-wall vent\nSingle-wall vents are constructed from a single layer of galvanized steel. Sections must be secured with three screws, positioned 120° apart, at each joint.\n\nBecause they are not insulated, single-wall vents must not pass through floors, ceilings, or any concealed areas within a building structure. CSA B149.1 specifies the minimum clearance requirements for combustibles.\n\nType BH vent\nGas technicians/fitters use Type BH vents with high-efficiency appliances that produce low flue temperatures and positive vent pressures, or appliances approved for \"BH only\" venting. The low flue temperatures create abundant H2O, so the venting system must be made of corrosion-resistant, leak-proof materials. A thin wall of flexible stainless steel pipe or plastic piping certified to ULC S636 can withstand the condensation of H2O and a positive vent pressure.\n\nBefore the regulatory acceptance of ULC S636 in 2007, venting materials included ABS and \"ordinary\" PVC/CPVC, which were not tested or certified to any specific standard. Although some existing installations of non-certified plastic venting remain in use, new plastic piping installations must employ certified ULC S636 venting systems.\n\nDirect vent\nDirect-vent appliances, also known as sealed combustion appliances, draw combustion air from the outside and vent all flue gases directly outdoors. Many direct-vent appliances operate on the natural-draft principle, where the draft from the combustion process is strong enough to vent the combustion products and draw in combustion air into through the vent/air intake system.\n\nBoth the vent and combustion air intakes are integral parts of the appliance, and must be installed in accordance with manufacturer instructions. Some direct-vent systems use concentric air intake/exhaust vents, while others have separate air intake and exhaust pipes.\n\nUsing a direct-vent appliance can be beneficial in buildings that experience negative pressure, have a hazardous atmosphere, or in other situations when it is not favourable to use a natural-draft vent.",

          "content": "[Content covers various types of atmospheric burners including monoport, upshot, multiport, drilled-port, drilled-pipe, slotted-port, ribbon-port, radiant-head, and pulse-combustion burners. Detailed descriptions of construction, operation, and uses for each type.]\n\nInshot monoport burner\nGas → Disc → Throat → Spud → Entrained primary air → Secondary air → Flame → Venturi-like body\n\nUpshot burners\nIn an upshot burner, the air/gas mixture flows through a bend and into a riser tube, where it burns vertically. Again, a flame spreader is sometimes mounted above the port to spread the flame.\n\nMultiport burners\nMultiport burners are the most common atmospheric burner in appliances. The basic components are the same as a monoport upshot burner with the addition of a multiport burner head.\n\nMultiple burner ports:\n• distribute flames to provide good heat transfer to the heat exchanger;\n• spread the flames so they can be reached by secondary air; and\n• provide stable blue flames.\n\n(Multiport burners are susceptible to internal clogging from lint.)\n\nSome of the more common types of multiport burners are drilled port, drilled pipe, slotted port, and ribbon port.\n\nDrilled-port burners\nClassified as multiport burners, drilled-port burners are iron castings that can be shaped like stars, wheels, ring segments, concentric rings, and rectangular and single or multiple bars.\n\nSome cast-iron, drilled-port burners have a small raised boss for each port. These bosses increase the port length, which reduces flashback, and allows better secondary air coverage to surround the flame jet. The cast sections also provide open areas for proper air distribution.\n\nTo overcome the small turndown on low-mixture pressures, these burners, in large capacity, are often divided into units, such as the separate rings in concentric ring burners, each with individual mixers. This allows you to completely turn off part of the burner while still maintaining the turndown.\n\nUsing smaller drill sizes for the burner ports results in a more even distribution of flames. Ports should not be larger than a No. 29 drill, but to avoid plugging, they should not be smaller than a No. 42.\n\nUses: Drilled-port burners spread heat at a low intensity over a relatively large area for relatively low-temperature operations (such as heating small solution tanks, cooking kettles, candy furnaces, stovetop ovens, and broiler burners).\n\nDrilled-pipe burners\nManufacturers make drilled-pipe burners from standard pipes with either one row of holes on top or two rows at 30° each side of vertical.\n\nThe critical measurements are:\n• port size;\n• total port area;\n• ratio of port area to cross-section;\n• total length; and\n• distance from the mixer to the first port.\n\nUses: The drilled-pipe burner is used in applications that require a long, narrow heat band, as in large solution tanks. Often, several parallel pipe burners make a simpler installation than several cast-head burners.\n\nSlotted-port burners\nIn slotted-port burners, the sawed slots (rather than drilled holes) in the pipe are a modification of the drilled pipe burner. The slots must be kept quite narrow, however, which makes them prone to clogging. In addition, the slot length can lead to warping in hot locations.\n\nUses: Slotted-port burners are frequently used in ovens and broiler burners as well as some industrial applications.\n\nRibbon-port burners\nSimilar to a drilled-pipe burner, a ribbon-port burner is often made from standard pipes. Instead of drilled holes, though, the combustion ports are lengthwise slots with an assembly of crimped and straight metal strips pressed into them.\n\nThe spaces created by the crimped metal provide individual ports, which results in a continuous flame instead of individual jets. Because of the solid flame, the slot width must be narrow enough to allow secondary air to reach the centre of the flame. (As a rule, the continuous flame is generally shorter for the same Btu release of heat in the ribbon-port burner than it is in the drilled-pipe burner.)\n\nUses: Ribbon-port burners are widely used in large bakery ovens, solder pots, and textile singeing and shrinking machines. They are also used in tentering frames for stretching and drying fabrics.\n\nRadiant-head atmospheric burners\nThe basic atmospheric burner design can be adapted to supply a partial premix of air and gas to a catalytic burner head, which then creates a radiant heat surface. The catalytic burner head may be made of ceramic or a porous matrix with a catalytic agent coating, such as platinum.\n\nPulse-combustion atmospheric burners\nA pulse-combustion burner is a unique type of atmospheric burner that enables burning the fuel-air mixture in separate pulses (rather than continuously as occurs in a standard gas burner). Since the air supply does not require a mechanical device, the pulse burner falls within the atmospheric burner category. Notice that the use of a blower is for pre-purge and post-purge only.\n\nA pulse-combustion atmospheric burner operates as follows:\n1) Gas and air enter and mix in the combustion chamber.\n2) To start the cycle, the burner uses a spark to ignite the gas and air mixture (this is one \"pulse\").\n3) The positive pressure from combustion closes flapper valves and forces the exhaust gases down a tailpipe.\n4) Exhaust gases leaving the chamber create negative pressure which opens the flapper valve, drawing in gas and air.\n5) At the same time, part of the pulse is reflected from the tailpipe, causing the new gas and air mixture to ignite. No spark is needed here (this is another \"pulse\").\n6) Steps 4 and 5 repeat 60 to 70 times per second, forming consecutive \"pulses\" of ¼ to ½ Btu/h each.\n7) Latent heat is removed from combustion products, and condensate (water) forms in the condensate coil.",

          "content": "Flame detectors are discussed in detail in the next section of this Chapter, \"Flame-sensing devices\".\n\nTypes of initial ignition sources\nThe initial ignition source for automatic ignition systems may be spark ignition, direct-spark ignition, or hot-surface ignition.\n\nSource - Description\n- Spark ignition: Spark ignition is an automatic ignition system that uses an ignition spark to light a pilot burner\n- Direct-spark ignition: Direct-spark ignition is an automatic ignition system that uses an ignition spark to light the main burner. Direct-spark ignition applies to burners not using a pilot\n- Hot-surface ignition: Hot-surface ignition is an ignition system in which a hot surface, such as a glow bar, automatically ignites the pilot or main burner flame upon each call for heat (Older systems were designed to provide a relight function for continuous pilots.)\n\nThe hot-surface igniter (HSI) is likely the most commonly used electronic ignition system today. HSI systems are reliable and inexpensive (as are the electronic controls they require).\n\nThe HSI works like a light bulb filament. It is typically made from a material like silicon carbide or nitride, and when electricity (120 V ac) passes through it, it glows white hot.\n\nMost HSI systems have the following sequence of operations:\n1) The thermostat calls for heat.\n2) The draft inducer motor starts.\n3) The pressure switch attached (by a small tube) to the draft motor will sense the negative pressure created by the draft inducer.\n4) The draft inducer motor runs for 30 to 60 sec.\n5) The flame sensor senses heat from the pilot or HSI and allows gas to flow to the burners.\n6) The hot-surface igniter (or intermittent) pilot ignites the gas burner.\n\nThe electronic controls that regulate this sequence of operations are discussed in Chapter 4 of this unit.\n\nFlame-sensing devices\n\nFlame detectors respond to the establishment of a flame during the trial for ignition of a pilot flame or main flame, and to the loss of an established flame. This (response time) is referred to as the \"flame failure response time\" or FFRT. The maximum allowable FFRT is determined by the standard to which the appliance is certified and the type of flame detection used.\n\nThe flame detector responds either by shutting off the gas flow for all burners (as in a thermocouple flame detection system), or by sending an electrical signal to a flame safeguard control that acts upon the gas valve(s).\n\nThe seven most common types of flame-sensing methods that residential or light commercial appliances employ are:\n• constant supervision;\n• bimetal heat sensors;\n• bulb-and-bellows heat sensors;\n• thermocouple or thermopile heat sensors;\n• thermistor heat sensors;\n• flame rod current rectification sensors;\n• optical light sensors; and\n• ultraviolet and infrared scanners.\n\nConstant supervision\nThe most basic (and least reliable) means of detecting the presence or absence of a flame is to have a knowledgeable person observe the flame (and take appropriate action during flame ignition and flame failure).\n\nThis is the \"flame detection method\" for portable torches and barbecues — with constant supervision being as reliable and fast-acting (or not) as the person tending the flame.\n\nBimetal flame sensor\nA bimetal strip is formed by welding two dissimilar (different) metals together. Due to the different temperature coefficients of expansion of the metals, the strip bevels (or curves) as the temperature changes. This principle can be used to sense heat radiation from a flame and function to activate an electrical circuit.\n\nSome modern appliances (such as clothes dryers) employ highly sensitive bimetal flame sensors.\n\nBulb-and-bellows flame sensors\nBulb-and-bellows flame sensors consist of a bulb, capillary tube, and bellows that contain a temperature-expansive liquid, such as mercury, toluene, or silicone. When exposed to heat, this liquid expands, causing a hydraulic action on the bellows, which then acts upon a switch to complete an electrical circuit, allowing current flow to the gas valve(s). Conversely, if the flame fails, the liquid contracts, opening the circuit and closing the valve.\n\nThe size and appearance of the bulb-and-bellows flame detector are similar to those of a thermocouple flame detector, but the response time is much quicker (usually less than 15 sec). Bulb-and-bellows flame sensors are commonly found on some residential gas fireplaces.\n\nThermocouple and thermopile flame sensors\nThermocouples help power combustion safety circuits with constant pilots and are used on appliances with manual reset controls. The thermocouple is the power supply for the combustion safety circuit of a gas furnace. The thermocouple assembly is attached with a threaded male fitting.\n\nWhen the pilot burner heats the hot junction, the thermocouple generates a voltage to power the electromagnet in the safety shut-off valve or switch. As long as the pilot remains lit, the shut-off valve remains energized and open, which allows gas flow to the main and pilot burners. Conversely, if the pilot light goes out, the thermocouple cools down, and the resulting drop in voltage causes the safety valve to shut off the flow of gas.\n\nA thermopile (also known as a powerpile) consists of multiple thermocouples joined together at one end and connected in series to generate more voltage than a single thermocouple. The higher voltage produced allows a powerpile to power the combustion safety and control circuits of an appliance. Powerpile generators are used on appliances with automatic controls.\n\nThermistor flame sensors\nA thermistor is a solid-state device in which the electrical resistance decreases with temperature. This reaction can be used to monitor flame status by immersing the thermistor in the pilot, main flame, or both, with a flame ignition control monitoring the current flow through the thermistor.\n\nSome HSIs both ignite a pilot or main burner and detect the presence or absence of a flame by employing the principles of a thermistor. Then, if the flame is established and maintained after the HSI has completed its function as an igniter, it remains hot and allows current to pass through the igniter.\n\nFlame rod sensors\nFlame rod sensors are the most common type of flame sensors on modern gas-fired appliances. These systems rely on a flame's ability to conduct current when a voltage is applied across two electrodes within the flame. The heat from the flame causes molecules between the electrodes to forcibly collide, knocking electrons out of atoms and producing ions — a process known as \"flame ionization\".\n\nAn electric control applies an ac (alternating current) voltage to the flame rod; however, a pulsating dc (direct current) passes through the flame since the flame rod is at least four times smaller than the grounding surface or electrode (here, the burner).\n\nIn some cases, the flame rod also serves as the spark-igniter rod until a flame is established (and then acts as a flame sensor). This system is often called a \"unirod\".\n\nOptical flame sensors\nLight is a product of combustion that can be detected by an optical flame sensor. Optical flame sensors can detect specific bands and frequencies of light waves emitted by a gas flame, to quickly and reliably inform a flame safeguard control about the establishment (or disappearance) of a flame.\n\nThe three major types of light waves in a gas flame are visible light waves, infrared (IR) light waves, and ultraviolet (UV) light waves. (Only the final two are safe to monitor a gas flame since there are too many sources of visible light that could fool a visible light detector.)\n\nInfrared scanners utilize a lead sulphide cell to sense infrared light invisible to the human eye. Lead sulphide is a semiconductor that decreases in electrical resistance when exposed to infrared light.\n\nUltraviolet scanners consist of two electrodes sealed in a gas-filled quartz glass tube filled with a special gas. After a high enough voltage is applied across the electrodes and the special gas exposed to a UV source, the cathode emits electrons, which ionize the special gas sealed in the tube, making the tube conductive, and current flow through it.\n\nOptical flame sensors can usually be found on higher-input appliances.",

          "content": "High-limit pressure switches\n\nA high-limit pressuretrol works exactly like an operating pressuretrol, except that it is set to a higher-pressure setting. Some high-limit pressuretrol models come with a manual reset device.\n\nPressure relief valves\nA pressure relief valve is a mechanical valve that controls pressure in water boilers. A pressure relief valve operates as follows: if the pressure in the system rises above the setpoint, the valve opens and dumps water, continuing to do this until the pressure drops to an acceptable level.\n\nCombination pressure-temperature relief valves\nSome codes require storage water heaters to be installed with a combination pressure-temperature relief valve. If so, the sensing stem of this valve extends into the water up to 6 in from the top of the tank, and the valve opens to release water when (if) the tank pressure or water temperature becomes excessively high. Whenever these water heaters are replaced, make sure to install a new valve (and discard the old one).\n\nImportant: The discharge piping for relief valves must not have any restrictions or reductions in diameter and the discharge of relief valves must be directed to an air gap as per local building codes.\n\nThe piping material must also be suitable (i.e., able to withstand discharge temperatures).\n\nLow-water cut-off switches\nA low-water cut-off switch is used on all steam boilers and water boilers with a capacity over 400 000 Btu/h, and when any part of the heating system is located under the boiler. A low-water cut-off switch responds to fluid loss by opening its contacts and cutting off power to the main gas valve if the water level in the boiler falls below the minimum level.\n\nThere are two types of low-water cut-off switches: float and probe.\n\nType - Description\n- Float: For this type of low-water cut-off switch, a float is connected to a normally open switch. The operation occurs as follows: when the float is elevated by the water level, it holds closed the contacts (of the normally open switch). Then, if the water level falls below a predetermined point, the float mechanism lowers and breaks the electrical contacts.\n- Probe: This type of low-water cut-off switch also uses a normally open switch. The probe has electronic circuitry that utilizes boiler water to conduct current between the terminals on the end of the probe. Then, if the water falls below the level of the probe, the electronic circuit between the terminals is broken. In response to the broken circuit, the low-water cut-off switch opens, cutting off power to the main gas valve.\n\nFlow switches\nA flow switch responds to water movement. They ensure, before the main burner can fire, that the pumps are circulating water in the piping system and the boiler. (Boilers that require flow switches have small water capacities, and their water may turn to steam if the water flow is inadequate.)\n\nAirflow switches\nThere are two common types of airflow switches, as detailed below.\n• A sail switch works similarly to a flow switch, except that it acts in response to the movement of air rather than water.\n• A pressure differential switch senses, across its sensing mechanism, airflow by the pressure differential.\n\nAirflow switches are used in applications that require proof of airflow (for example, by sensing combustion air or flue gas flow in an appliance that incorporates a fan or blower). In the case of a pressure differential switch, an airflow switch is used to sense the venting action of a high-efficiency furnace.\n\nA blocked vent, faulty heat exchanger (or even a blocked drain tube) can cause the pressure switch to activate, shutting furnace operation down.\n\nFlame rollout switches\nA flame rollout switch is a high-temperature limit switch that is wired to the burner ignition control. If the flame rollout switch senses flame rollout, it will open and de-energize the gas valve. A flame rollout switch requires manual reset.\n\nFlame rollout usually results from the failure to vent flue products from the combustion chamber(s) or a heat exchanger failure. If the burner flame becomes trapped or disturbed inside a heat exchanger, it may flash back or roll outside the combustion chamber area, potentially causing a CO or fire hazard.\n\nBlocked-vent shut-off systems\nFurnaces with a draft hood may be equipped with a blocked vent shut-off system that automatically turns off the main burner when the vent is completely blocked. These shut-off systems are commonly (but incorrectly) known as \"spill switches\". Test methods for these systems are specified in furnace certification standards. Similar to the flame rollout switch, these shut-off systems are temperature-sensing, and have manual reset switches wired in series with the gas valve function.\n\nElectronic control modules\nElectronic control modules are the \"brain\" of most modern furnace electronic ignition systems. They use an integrated circuit board to control many sophisticated processes, including self-diagnostics (with failure codes).\n\nThe operation occurs as follows. The integrated circuit continuously monitors a furnace's operation (as well as its own operation), and if a failure occurs, LED lights will indicate a specific failure code (the meaning of which can be found in the owner manual and on the furnace door).\n\nThese controllers are always found on higher-efficiency furnaces which include many sophisticated design features to reach their high AFUE ratings (over 90%).\n\nThe control module monitors the operation of the furnace, and if the safety circuits open, it will be detected by the gas furnace control board and the system locked out for a specific amount of time. After this time, the control board will try again for ignition (unless the safety circuit is still open, in which case the board will remain in lockout mode until a gas technician/fitter has resolved the problem).\n\nGas control valves\nGas control valves come in different models for different applications. Constant-pilot, intermittent-pilot, and direct-ignition models control the pilot and main burner gas to appliances, ensuring safe ignition and the control of gas delivery to burners.\n\nA gas control valve consists of\n• a regulator or a zero governor which reduces gas pressure or controls gas flow;\n• one or two automatic gas shut-off valves;\n• a manual shut-off valve (which may, if so equipped, direct gas flow to the pilot line only);\n• a means, if so equipped, of controlling the flow rate to the pilot line usually through a needle valve; and\n• test ports to measure inlet and outlet pressure.\n\nWireless controls\nHard-wired connections between thermostats and furnaces have several limitations — which wireless technology can now overcome. For example, wireless thermostats can enable temperature control in one or more locations during retrofits or new construction projects. Most wireless systems include a remote sensor thermostat and sensor and come with the option to add multiple remote controllers.",

          "content": "Tankless water heaters typically have substantially higher firing rates than tank-type water heaters, so have far better recovery rates. Since these systems function on an on-demand basis, they do not require a holding tank to store pre-warmed water.\n\nThe fact that they have no storage or holding reserve means that tankless water heaters have a lifespan potentially twice as long as traditional systems. This is because, with proper maintenance, the risk of rust and corrosion can drop significantly. The installer is responsible for carefully adhering to the manufacturer's installation requirements, and correct installation is essential for their proper functionality.\n\nFigure 5-22 shows a storage-type hot water heater tank. Although typical, this unit is limited in its recovery due to its significantly lower firing rates. The advantage of a storage-type hot water heater tank (over tankless-type water heaters) lies in its initial capacity and in its negligible pressure drop at high flow rates.\n\nA gas technician/fitter often receives questions comparing tank-type and tankless water heaters, but the \"best choice\" may not always be straightforward.\n\nInstead, by analyzing potential system variables (gpm requirements, water hardness, output/input temperatures, etc.), you can assess potential changes to gas/potable pipe sizing, and supply water pressure. Following this analysis, you will be better able to advise a customer on the advantages and disadvantages of both types of water heater. (It is essential to consider the application and site conditions when making recommendations.)\n\nFigure 5-23 shows another version of a storage water heater in which one tank houses water that is heating while a larger tank provides storage for the heated water. Water is circulated through the heater by way of gravity or a circulating pump.\n\nThis system allows the storage of large amounts of water for intermittent draw and the use of a smaller tank for heating. In addition, in this system the large storage tank can supply water at a temperature different from the temperature of the water in the heating tank.\n\nClause 7.27 of CSA B149.1 contains general installation requirements for water heaters.\n\nWater heaters\nItem - Description\n- Heat transfer: Conduction\n- Ignition: Standing pilot, spark-ignited pilot, direct-spark ignition, or hot-surface ignition\n- Burner control: Aquastat\n- Non-electric valves: Safeties\n- Safeties: Temperature and pressure-relief valves, High-limit aquastat, FVIR design\n\nFlammable vapour ignition resistance water heater design\nFlammable vapour ignition resistance (FVIR) technology was developed for gas-fired water heaters to resist the ignition of flammable vapours outside of/near the heater (this is typically a problem when flammable products are mishandled). FVIR helps reduce the risk of these incidents, which means the water heater is less likely to ignite flammable products.\n\nDecorative gas appliances\nClause 7.25 of CSA B149.1 contains general installation requirements for decorative gas appliances, such as gas logs.\n\nDecorative gas appliances\nItem - Description\n- Heat transfer: (Predominantly) radiation\n- Ignition: Standing pilot\n- Burner control: None\n- Safeties: None\n- Venting: Chimney, chimney liner, and Type B vent\n\nVented gas fireplaces\nVented gas fireplaces (previously, \"decorative gas appliances\") include fireplace inserts, freestanding stoves, and zero-clearance units.\n\nClause 7.25 of CSA B149.1 contains general installation requirements for decorative gas appliances, including vented gas fireplaces.\n\nVented gas fireplaces\nItem - Description\n- Heat transfer: Convection, radiation\n- Ignition: Standing pilot, piezo igniter, or hot-surface ignition\n- Burner control: Thermostat or manual switch\n- Safeties: Blocked-vent safety shut-off switch\n- Venting: Direct vent, Type B vent, flexible liners\n\nVarious heaters\nClauses 7.17 and 7.24 of CSA B149.1 contain general installation requirements for space heaters, recessed wall furnaces, and baseboard heaters.\n\nRoom space heaters\nA room space heater is a freestanding, self-contained unit installed in a room in which heat is necessary. Room space heaters must be under thermostatic control and vented to the outside atmosphere. The venting system can be either gravity or forced air (i.e., fan-assisted).\n\nRoom space heaters\nItem - Description\n- Heat transfer: Convection, radiation\n- Ignition: Standing pilot and spark igniter\n- Burner control: Thermostat or manual switch\n- Safeties: High-temperature limit switch\n- Venting: Direct vent, Type B vent\n\nRecessed wall furnaces\nA recessed wall furnace takes up less space and is easier to install than other room heaters. Wall furnaces were once recessed into the wall between the wall studs but are now mounted directly on the wall. Recessed wall furnaces are self-contained and available with or without a fan; they are often found in small houses, room additions, garages, cabins, or motel rooms.\n\nRecessed wall furnaces\nItem - Description\n- Heat transfer: Conduction\n- Ignition: Standing pilot, spark-ignited pilot, direct-spark ignition, or hot-surface ignition\n- Burner control: Thermostat\n- Safeties: High-temperature limit switch\n- Venting: Type BW vent\n\nBaseboard heaters\nBaseboard heaters operate independently from other heat sources, so can be installed as required throughout a building. Baseboard heaters are usually vented through an outside wall rather than through the ceiling. They are a low-input heating appliance that heats a certain area within a room.\n\nItem - Description\n- Heat transfer: Conduction, convection\n- Ignition: Standing pilot, spark-igniter pilot, direct-spark ignition, or hot-surface ignition\n- Burner control: Manual switch or thermostat\n- Safeties: High-temperature limit switch\n- Venting: Direct vent\n\nRooftop units\nRooftop units combine heating and cooling functions within a self-contained unit mounted on the roof of a building. Rooftop units are primarily used for low-rise commercial and industrial applications, such as commercial shopping centres and industrial parks.\n\nRooftop units\nItem - Description\n- Heat transfer: Conduction\n- Ignition: Spark-ignited pilot, direct-spark ignition, hot-surface ignition\n- Burner control: Thermostat\n- Safeties: High-temperature limit switch, gas pressure, and mercury pilot proving switches\n\nGenerators\nHome generator systems can be installed to run on a home's natural gas or propane supply. When a power failure occurs, the electric load automatically transfers to the generator.\n\nOnce commercial power is restored, the electric load transfers back to the utility line, and because this process is completely automatic, a ready supply of electric power can be assured (for lighting, heating, air conditioning, etc.).\n\nMost appliance manufacturers offer training on their products and appliances. In some cases, the validation of a warranty may not be possible if equipment was not initiated and/or installed by a licensed, factory-trained gas technician/fitter. Consequently, it is in the best interests of every gas technician to continuously upgrade his or her skills with available training. Doing so with continuously improve their prospects of employment as well as add further value to their clients.\n\nImportant: Connections made to gas appliances, including potable, hydronic, refrigerant, duct work, and electrical connections that exceed the essential components affecting the safe operation of the appliance, though potentially not mentioned within the Code, must meet local provincial and municipal code requirements and may fall outside a gas technician's/fitter's scope of practice.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the gas technician/fitter to comply with all codes as well as their local trade regulations.",

          "content": "Appliance conversions\n\nConversions between natural gas and propane occur for various reasons. In some cases, propane appliances are converted to natural gas when natural gas becomes available in a given region. Another common reason for conversion is propane barbecues that will be connected to a natural gas supply. Similarly, a natural gas appliance may be converted to propane after purchase if a buyer installs it in an area in which only propane is available.\n\nConsequently, each instance of conversion involves different criteria and aspects to consider.\n\nIn every case, the installer must perform a combustion analysis to\n• determine the completeness of combustion;\n• test for toxic gases; and\n• verify the proper operation of the burners.\n\nInstaller's responsibilities\n\nThe conversion of an appliance from one fuel type to another requires specialized knowledge and procedures. Indeed, if done incorrectly, the appliance will not function properly and could potentially be dangerous. A gas technician/fitter must perform all conversion procedures properly and, in some cases, must arrange for inspection of the converted appliance by the inspection authority (or an agency authorized by the inspection authority).\n\nOnly authorized individuals may perform fuel conversions on appliances with inputs of 400 000 Btu/h or less. Check local regulations for the required qualifications.\n\nSome jurisdictions may require you to have a permit before converting an appliance to an alternative fuel. Always adhere to a manufacturer's certified conversion instructions and/or obtain information from the manufacturer.\n\nBefore performing a conversion, check the following:\n\nAppliance\nInspect the appliance and its heat exchanger to ensure they are safe for continued use. Usually, this inspection involves removing burners, blowers, humidifiers, etc., and checking for scale, holes, cracks, water leaks, and seals. Existing appliances must be approved for conversion.\n\nInput\nWhen converting an appliance, the input must remain the same, and the new gas marked on the rating plate. (For the same orifice diameter and gas pressure, propane provides a higher input than natural gas.)\n\nThe supply pipe size may need to be replaced during conversion. When converting from propane (11 in w.c.) to natural gas (7 in w.c.), new gas piping or tubing will likely be required to meet sizing requirements. In reverse, when converting from natural gas (7 in w.c.) to propane (11 in w.c.), unless the original piping or tubing was undersized, it is unlikely that new piping or tubing will be required. If new piping is required, it is essential that the old piping is removed safely and disposed of properly.\n\nIf a propane tank will no longer be used,\n1) shut off all valves;\n2) disconnect the pipe or tubing; and\n3) plug the openings.\n\nVenting and air requirements\nVenting and combustion air requirements are based on input and do not normally undergo modification. However, it is essential to inspect venting and air supply ducting to confirm they are in good condition and ensure their compliance with code requirements.\n\nRequirements for conversion\n\nHere are CSA B149.1 requirements governing conversions.\n\n4.5.3 When an appliance is converted from the gas or fuel specified on the rating plate, the conversion shall be in accordance with the manufacturer's certified instructions. If there are no manufacturer's instructions for conversion of the appliance, the converted appliance shall be approved.\n\n4.5.4 If an appliance is converted from one gas to another, the gas to which it is converted shall be marked on the appliance rating plate by the fitter making the conversion.\n\nConversion criteria\n\nConversions from natural gas to propane\nThere are three possible scenarios a gas technician/fitter may face when converting from natural gas to propane.\n\nConversion scenario - Action steps - Other considerations\n1. A certified conversion kit is available: Under these circumstances, an authorized gas technician/fitter may perform the conversion according to the manufacturer's certified conversion instructions (i.e., no additional approval is required). In this scenario, the manufacturer should have included a label or sticker for the rating plate stating that 1) the conversion is complete; and 2) the appliance is now operating on propane gas.\n\n2. A similar appliance model has received certification for propane, but a certified conversion kit is unavailable: In this scenario, an authorized gas technician/fitter will 1) contact the appliance manufacturer and obtain the parts necessary to convert the appliance; 2) complete the conversion; and 3) contact the agency certifying the appliance to request an inspection and a new rating plate. In this scenario, before deciding to proceed with a conversion, a technician/fitter should consider the costs of recertifying the appliance.\n\n3. The appliance is certified only for natural gas, and no conversion kit is available: In this scenario, the conversion must be tested and labelled (field-approved) by the inspection authority or an agency authorized by the inspection authority. In this scenario, before deciding to proceed with a conversion, a technician/fitter should consider the costs of recertifying the appliance.\n\nConversions from propane to natural gas\nThere are three possible scenarios a gas technician/fitter may face when converting from propane to natural gas.\n\n[Similar three scenarios as above, but for propane to natural gas conversion]\n\nBurner orifice sizing\n\nConverting appliances means purchasing and installing properly sized gas orifices.\n\nA gas orifice is a hole or opening that controls the direction and amount of gas discharged into a burner. Burner orifices come in different shapes and sizes, with the actual size and configuration of each orifice dependent on the following factors:\n\nFactor - Description\n- The type of gas: The type of gas is the most important factor to consider when choosing an orifice. Although propane has a higher specific gravity than natural gas (a property which limits its flow through an orifice), its heat capacity is higher — which means that a smaller volume of propane (than natural gas) is required for the same production of heat. Consequently, for the same heat output, an orifice for propane will always be smaller than an orifice for natural gas.\n\n- Appliance input: The size of an orifice directly affects the consumption rate of an appliance: the larger the appliance capacity, the larger the orifice must be.\n\n- Manifold pressure: Manifold pressure influences the size of the orifice that is required because the greater the pressure, the greater the volumetric flow. When an orifice size is changed during a fuel conversion, it is often necessary to adjust the manifold. In any case, it is always a \"must\" to check this.\n\nAlways keep the appliance input rate the same as that specified by the appliance manufacturer on the appliance rating plate (and/or the certified conversion instructions).\n\nImproper adjustment of the input rate can lead to serious issues such as poor burner flame characteristics, CO production, or both. Also, overfiring poses a potential fire hazard and overheating can damage or destroy a heat exchanger.\n\nManufacturers provide data on orifice size relative to input capacity for natural gas and propane. For more information about orifice sizing, refer to \"Annex I — General information\" in CSA B149.1 and CSA B149.2.\n\nManifold pressure\n\nIn addition to changing the size of the orifice, the appliance's manifold pressure requires adjusting — a procedure that requires you to use pressure-measuring equipment (a manometer) to confirm that the correct manifold pressure has been achieved.\n\n1) In the case of certified conversion kits, the appliance manufacturer indicates whether or not adjustments to the manifold pressure are required. (In all cases, check that the gas supply pressure, immediately upstream of the manifold, falls within the recommended range for the appliance.)\n2) When no certified conversion kits are available but the appliance has received certification for both fuels, get the original testing data from the agency certifying the appliance and adjust the manifold pressure accordingly.\n\nAlways keep the manifold pressure within the range specified by the appliance manufacturer because adjustments beyond this range can adversely affect the operation of the burner.\n• Pressures that are too low may not entrain enough air into the burner.\n• Pressures that are too high may entrain too much air.\n(In both cases, poor burner flame characteristics can occur, which may result in CO production.)\n\nTo avoid problems and save time, always consult the manufacturer of the appliance before attempting unusual conversions.",

          "content": "In most jurisdictions where a G.3 (GF-B1) is recognized, a G.3 certificate holder may reactivate a gas appliance under the supervision of a higher-licensed gas technician/fitter. Gas technicians/fitters should be familiar with local regulations to determine which qualifications are required to perform various activities associated with installing, servicing, and reactivating natural gas and propane equipment.\n\nBefore lighting an appliance, a series of checks must be performed to ensure safe reactivation and the proper and efficient operation of the appliance.\n\nVenting system checklist\n\nThe first system to check before reactivating an appliance is the venting system. In fact, the most common cause of CO poisoning from gas equipment can be found in venting system problems.\n\nBelow is an outline of a complete venting system examination.\n\nStep 1 — Check the vents\n1) Check that the vent area meets code requirements for the appliance input.\n2) Ensure that the venting material meets code requirements for – the appliance type; and – the expected flue temperatures.\n\nStep 2 — Check the exterior venting system\n1) Visually check the inside of the vent or chimney to ensure there are no obstructions, soot, creosote, or deterioration.\n2) Examine the exterior portion of the venting to ensure that it is in an acceptable condition. With a masonry chimney: Check for eroded or cracked mortar. With a metal chimney: Check for corrosion.\n3) Check the termination height and required distances from other vertical surfaces.\n4) Check for proper termination caps. If a masonry chimney has a metal liner, ensure the top seal plate is in place to prevent airflow through the chimney (as this can result in condensation and corrosion of the metal liner).\n\nStep 3 — Check the interior venting system\n1) Visually check the inside of the vent or chimney to make sure there are no blockages. a) Use a mirror to check the condition of the liner for obstructions, soot, creosote, or deterioration. b) Examine and empty any debris from the chimney cleanout opening and ensure that the door is tight-fitting.\n2) Examine the interior portion of the venting to ensure that it is in an acceptable condition. With a masonry chimney: Check for the type of lining tile and its condition. With a metal chimney: Check for corrosion.\n3) Check for unapproved dampers and other devices.\n4) Inspect the draft hood for any signs of carbon (black powder). (Carbon deposits can indicate incomplete combustion, and the need to make burner adjustments.)\n5) For plastic venting systems, inspect for leaks at joints and cracks or distortion along the vent length.\n\nAdditional checklist\n\nOnce you are satisfied that the venting system has adequate sizing and is in good condition, perform other checks before reactivation.\n\n1) Check that combustion and ventilation air openings meet code requirements.\n2) Check the appliance combustion chamber and surrounding area for the following:\n   - Scorching: Indicates overheating → Check if the appliance is overfiring, Check for restrictions in flue and vent passages\n   - Sooting: Indicates incomplete combustion → Check appliance input rate and burner operation to ensure an adequate air supply, Check for restrictions in the flue or vent passages\n   - Scaling: Indicates corrosion → If rust flakes build up inside the top section of a heat exchanger, incomplete combustion and CO can result (If advanced, flame rollout can also occur)\n   - Burnt wiring: Indicates overheating → May result from flame rollout\n   - Heat exchanger cracks, etc.: Visual inspection and/or other methods (there are many methods to test; in general, you can perform a combination of tests in order to confirm the situation before you proceed further)\n\n3) If any of the above conditions exist, you must correct them (whether before or after reactivation), depending on the specific condition.\n4) Check the available gas pressure and pipe size.\n5) Connect the gas supply to the appliance.\n6) Test and purge the gas supply according to code requirements. (See the unit, \"Introduction to piping and tubing systems\").\n\nFurnace cleaning\n\nIn a furnace, you should clean the filter system, blower, and motor (as outlined below).\n\nCaution! Always ensure the power supply is turned off before starting these furnace cleaning steps.\n\nStep 1 — Clean the filter system\n1) To check the filter: a) Take the filter out and hold it up to the light. b) If the filter looks clogged (regardless of the length of time that it has been in use), replace it with a new one of the same type and size.\n\nFilter type - Description\n- Disposable furnace filter: A disposable furnace filter consists of fibre mesh in a cardboard frame, with the size of the filter printed on the edge of the frame. An arrow on the edge of the frame indicates the correct direction of airflow through the filter. • Air flows from the return air duct toward the blower. • The arrow on the filter should point away from the return air duct, toward the blower.\n- Permanent filter: A permanent filter is usually sprayed with a special filter-coating chemical found at hardware stores and home centres. Clean the filter according to manufacturer instructions (which are usually attached to the furnace housing). To replace a filter, an electronic air cleaner should have • cartridges cleaned per the manufacturer's instructions; and • permanent screen filters removed and cleaned.\n\nStep 2 — Clean the blower\nThe blower assembly, belts and pulleys to the blower, and motor housing must be cleaned. Cleaning the blower is critical if the furnace has a squirrel-cage fan because openings in the blower often get clogged with dirt in this situation.\n\nTo clean the blower, first remove the panel that covers the filter to gain access to the blower or panel on the front of the furnace. (This panel may be slip-fit on hooks or held by a series of retaining screws. Sliding out the fan unit, which is held on tracks by screws, may help you gain access to the inside of the blower.)\n\nStep 3 — Clean the motor\n1) On a high-efficiency unit, it may be necessary to remove or relocate an electrical panel or control module.\n2) If equipped with a fan belt, check its condition.\n3) Treat the fan motor with oil (if advised to do so by the manufacturer).\n4) Other areas of concern include the inlet side of air-conditioning evaporator coils (as these can become clogged with dirt and function like a dirty filter). a) In addition, on high-efficiency units, the secondary heat exchanger (which you can access after the blower assembly has been removed), may require cleaning to remove dirt buildup on the coil surface. b) Clean the condensate drain tubing and, specifically on high-efficiency units, confirm it to be free-running to the floor drain (to ensure trouble-free drainage).\n\nReactivating gas appliances\n\nWhen the appliance is ready for reactivation, you must recheck the system after gasification and before it is lit.\n\nIn all cases, you must perform a combustion analysis (to determine the completeness of combustion) and test for toxic gases before the appliance is left in operation.\n\nImportant: When reactivating a natural gas system, slowly turn on the main valve to a regulator/meter set. (If it is turned on too quickly, the regulator will not have time to react, which could cause overpressure damage to the meter diaphragm, regulator, and other downstream gas controls.)\n\nChecking the system once gasified\n1) Visually check the piping to ensure there are no openings in the system from which gas could escape.\n2) Check for shut-off valve seepage (see the unit, \"Introduction to piping and tubing systems\").\n3) Shut off the appliance.\n4) Install a manometer or pressure gauge at the gas meter outlet.\n5) Introduce gas into the system. a) Listen for the gas flow to stop. b) Monitor the gas meter test dial to ensure the gas does not escape.\n6) Turn off the meter valve. (The system will now contain gas under pressure.)\n7) Maintain the gas pressure indicated on the manometer or pressure test gauge for a minimum of 10 min (for a situation when the manometer or pressure gauge decreases, indicating a leak, refer to the unit, \"Introduction to piping and tubing systems\").\n8) Upon completing the system gas pressure test, use an approved leak check soap solution to perform a leak test of all control valves and appliance piping (not previously tested) under normal operating pressure to confirm that they are gastight.\n\nAdditional procedures when reactivating a tank or cylinder\n1) Do a valve-seepage test on each stage (see the unit, \"Introduction to piping and tubing systems\").\n2) Place a pressure gauge on each stage.\n3) Turn off the manual shut-off valve at the appliance.\n4) Pressurize the system with the gas.\n5) Shut off the supply valve.\n6) Monitor gauges for a decrease in pressure, which indicates external leakage.\n\nLighting up the appliance\n\nUpon completing all necessary checks, light up the appliance, following manufacturer instructions.\n\nWith the main burner in operation, do the following:\n1) Check the manifold gas pressure with a manometer. Adjust the regulator if necessary.\n2) Observe the main flame. a) Check for flame stability. b) Check for flame impingement, flame lift-off, and flame rollout.\n3) Check the venting action to ensure a) proper draft; and b) no spillage.\n4) Always analyze flue products to check for complete, efficient combustion.\n5) Check and confirm the proper operation of all safety controls on the unit, such as a) high limits and flame safeguards; b) pressure switches; and c) auxiliary limits.\n6) Before leaving the appliance, check the input.\n\nIf a meter is available: Check the input by measuring the flow rate through the meter by monitoring the test dial (known as \"clocking the meter\").\nIf a meter is not available: Make sure the installation of the proper orifice and the maintenance of the manifold pressure are in accordance with the manufacturer's specified rating.",

The vented products vary from innocuous \ngases that result from complete combustion to toxic gases that result \nfrom incomplete combustion. The most important use for venting is to \nexhaust the combustion products safely to the outside atmosphere \nwithout spillage and without water vapour condensing in the appliance or \nvent unless they are designed for condensing. The use of natural draft, \nmechanical draft, or a combination of both may help achieve venting.\nMK by Mike Kapin\nCreated\nCopywrite 2025\nPurpose of a Venting System\nRemoval of Flue Gas\nSafely removes products of combustion to the outside atmosphere, including \ncarbon dioxide, water vapor, nitrogen, and carbon monoxide.\nPrevention of Condensation Damage\nPrevents corrosion inside heat exchangers, flue passages, and vent pipes when \nwater vapor condenses at low temperatures.\nProtection from Fire Hazard\nEnsures proper vent material, installation method, and clearance to \ncombustibles to prevent fires from high-temperature flue gases.\nSupply of Fresh Air\nProvides essential fresh air to the burner for proper combustion and venting as \nflue gases exit the appliance.\nHistorical Context of Venting\n1\nEarly Dwellings\nEarly peoples built fires at the center of their dwellings and \nventilated smoke through a hole in the roof.

The \ndifference in pressure causes the hot gases to rise, thus \nproducing a suction effect in the heat exchanger. This is \nsometimes what you call thermal draft.\nCategory 1 appliances that have a negative vent pressure \nand are less than 83% efficient most commonly use natural \ndraft. These appliances are vented into properly lined \nchimneys or factory-built vents.\nConventional natural draft venting principles rely on the \nnatural tendency of hot gases to rise. This creates a pressure \ndifferential that draws combustion products up through the \nventing system.\nBalanced Flue Natural Draft Appliances\nBalanced flue, direct vent appliances vented into special venting systems that are \ndesigned and approved for use with the specific appliance also employ natural draft \nventing. Although the vent pressure may be slightly negative, the flue gas \ntemperature is well above the dew point temperature (approximately 127-130°F) that \nwould otherwise cause the water vapour to condense.\nIn both the conventional and balanced flue types of natural draft venting systems, \nthe use of a mechanical device is not necessary to remove flue gases from the \nappliance to the outdoors\nFactors Affecting Natural Draft Venting Systems\nStack Temperature\nHigher average stack temperature increases draft\nOutdoor Air Temperature\nLower outdoor temperature increases draft\nStack Height\nGreater stack height increases draft\nThe quantity of theoretical draft in a stack, measured in inches of water column or in pascals, is directly proportional to the \nabsolute temperature difference between the stack gas and its surroundings, and to the height of the stack. Note that draft \ndoes not directly depend on the diameter of the stack.\nFactors Under Technician Control\nHeat Transfer Efficiency\nAffected by excess air, heated medium temperature, flow rate, and heat exchanger cleanliness\nVent Material\nHigher insulating value maintains stack temperature throughout travel to outdoors\nVent Diameter\nProper sizing ensures effective removal of flue gases while maintaining temperature\nVent Configuration\nMinimizing resistance to flow by reducing lateral lengths and changes in direction\nVent Location\nProper placement minimizes heat transfer through vent material\nDraft Control Equipment\nFor proper venting and combustion efficiency, you must control the amount, and force, of the draft. A draft that is too strong pulls in too much combustion air, thus \nreducing efficiency. A draft that is too weak smothers the flame and reduces the combustion efficiency. Draft control equipment is therefore an essential part of a natural \ndraft venting system.\nDraft Hood\nMany domestic gas burners are of the atmospheric type and require a neutral over \nfire draft in the combustion chamber. The draft hood maintains this neutral \npressure over the fire by allowing dilution air into the venting system.\nBarometric Damper\nUsed on gas appliances that operate with a controlled negative over fire draft in the \ncombustion chamber. They regulate dilution air, down-draft, and spillage.\nDraft Hood Function\nThe draft hood serves several important functions in a natural draft venting system:\n•\nMaintains neutral pressure over the fire\n•\nPrevents excessive negative pressure in the combustion chamber\n•\nAllows dilution air into the venting system\n•\nDecouples the venting system from the appliance\nWhen there is no draft, a back draft, or a blockage beyond the draft hood, the flue gases exit \nout of the draft hood, causing spillage. When there is an updraft in the venting system, the \ndraft hood permits dilution air to enter the draft hood.\nA hood is either built into the gas appliance or is part of the vent connector.

          "content": "Gas Appliance Venting Systems\nThis comprehensive course explores the critical aspects of venting systems for gas appliances. You'll learn about the purpose of venting, different types of venting systems including natural draft and mechanical draft, and the various components that ensure safe and efficient operation. Understanding proper venting is essential for gas technicians to prevent hazards such as carbon monoxide poisoning, condensation damage, and fire risks.\nMK\nby Mike Kapin\nPurpose of Venting Systems\nRemoval of Combustion Gases\nVenting systems safely remove combustion gases and excess air from an appliance to the outdoors while supplying fresh air to the burner to replace the exhausted air.\nPrevention of Condensation Damage\nProper venting prevents water vapor from condensing in the appliance or vent unless they are specifically designed for condensing operation.\nProtection from Fire Hazards\nVenting systems protect building structures from fire hazards by safely containing and directing hot combustion gases away from combustible materials.\nSupply of Fresh Air\nVenting creates negative pressure that draws fresh outside air to the burner, ensuring proper combustion and efficient operation.\nCourse Learning Objectives\nExplain Venting System Purpose\nUnderstand the fundamental reasons why venting systems are essential for gas appliance operation and safety.\nUnderstand Natural Draft Venting\nLearn the principles behind natural draft venting systems and how they utilize thermal differences to remove combustion products.\nComprehend Mechanical Draft Venting\nExplore mechanical draft venting systems that use fans or blowers to forcibly move combustion gases through the venting system.\nIdentify Gas Vent Types\nRecognize different types of gas vents and understand their appropriate applications for various gas appliances.\nKey Terminology\nTerm\nDefinition\nProducts of combustion\nGases and vapors resulting from the burning of fuel in an appliance\nNatural draft\nPressure difference between hot air/gases in a chimney or vent and the cooler, heavier air outside, causing hot gases to rise\nMechanical draft\nDraft that a mechanical device such as a fan or blower produces\nThermal draft\nSame as Natural draft - relies on temperature differences to create upward flow\nHistorical Context of Venting\nEarly Dwellings\nEarly peoples built fires at the center of their dwellings and ventilated smoke through a hole in the roof. Ventilation air entered and exited through doors, windows, and other unsealed openings.\nDevelopment of Chimneys\nAs buildings became more sophisticated, dedicated venting systems like chimneys were developed to channel smoke and combustion gases outside.\nModern Airtight Buildings\nToday, people spend more time indoors in virtually airtight buildings, requiring more sophisticated heating systems and venting solutions.\nAdvanced Venting Technology\nModern venting systems incorporate specialized materials and designs to handle different types of appliances and ensure safety in energy-efficient buildings.\nFunctions of a Venting System\nRemoval of Flue Gas\nA venting system safely removes products of combustion (flue gas) to the outside atmosphere, preventing dangerous accumulation inside the building.\nPrevention of Condensation Damage\nProper venting prevents water vapor from condensing in the appliance or vent, which could cause corrosion and damage unless specifically designed for condensing operation.\nProtection from Fire Hazard\nVenting systems protect building structures from fire hazards by safely containing and directing hot combustion gases away from combustible materials.\nSupply of Fresh Air\nAs flue gases leave the appliance, negative pressure draws fresh outside air to the burner, ensuring proper combustion and efficient operation.\nFlue Gas Components\nFlue Gas\nDescription\nCarbon dioxide (CO₂)\nDoes not support combustion; when dissolved in water vapor, forms carbonic acid which corrodes steel venting pipes\nWater vapor (H₂O)\nA 100,000 Btu/h furnace produces approximately 200 ft³/h of water vapor\nNitrogen (N₂)\nColorless, odorless gas that constitutes 78% of the atmosphere; not harmful nor used for heating purposes\nCarbon monoxide (CO)\nProduct of incomplete combustion; remains combustible; must be vented from the building because it is deadly\nCondensation in Venting Systems\nThe Condensation Problem\nWhen flue gas temperature is low, water vapor in the combustion products condenses. This condensation can cause serious corrosion inside the heat exchanger, flue passages, and vent pipes.\nCondensed water vapor mixes with carbon dioxide to form carbonic acid, which attacks metal components and accelerates their deterioration.\nStandard appliances and venting systems are not designed to handle condensation. Only appliances and vents specifically designed for condensing operation can safely manage this moisture.\nFire Hazard Protection\nTemperature Considerations\nFlue gas temperature in the vent can range from 100°F (40°C) for properly setup high-efficiency appliances (condensing appliances) to 500°F (260°C) for low-efficiency or improperly setup appliances.\nThe vent material, installation method, and clearance to combustibles must meet the requirements of CSA B149.1 and the manufacturer's certified instructions to prevent fires.\nProper clearances between hot vent components and combustible building materials are essential to prevent fires. These clearances vary based on the type of vent and the maximum temperatures it may reach.\nSupply of Air to the Burner\nNegative Pressure Creation\nAs flue gases leave the appliance via the venting system, pressure at the inlet drops\nFresh Air Drawn In\nThe negative pressure draws fresh outside air to the burner\nProper Combustion\nFresh air ensures complete combustion and efficient operation\nContinuous Process\nThis cycle continues as long as the appliance operates\nProblems with Venting System Failures\nCO₂ Spillage\nSpillage of CO₂ inside the building can result in potentially serious health effects for occupants due to reduced levels of oxygen.\nWater Vapor Damage\nSpillage of water vapor inside the building can result in damage to the building structure through mold and rot.\nCarbon Monoxide Poisoning\nSpillage of CO, if incomplete combustion is occurring in the appliance, can result in CO poisoning of the occupants.\nCombustion Problems\nFailure to remove products of combustion from around the flame prevents fresh combustion air from entering, resulting in incomplete combustion.\nMore Venting System Failure Risks\nCondensation Damage\nCondensation of acidic water vapor inside the appliance and/or vent can result in damage to the equipment if not designed for condensation.\nReduced Efficiency\nImproper venting can reduce heat transfer efficiency, resulting in longer cycles and higher heating costs.\nFlame Roll-out\nFire hazards can result from flame roll-out from the combustion chamber due to failure to provide proper flow of air and flue gases.\nIgnition of Combustibles\nFire hazards can result from vent material raising the temperature of combustible material to the point of ignition.\nRisk Levels by Venting System Type\nNatural Draft Systems\nNatural draft venting systems are more susceptible to all the previously mentioned problems compared to mechanical draft systems due to their principles of operation and the need to rely on the installer to make decisions.\nThese systems depend on temperature differences and stack effect, making them vulnerable to external factors like weather conditions and building pressures.\nMechanical Draft Systems\nMechanical draft systems can also fail. Their advantages, however, are that they usually have more safety devices monitoring venting action, and more explicit installation instructions are available to the installer.\nThese systems typically include pressure switches and other safety controls that shut down the appliance if venting problems occur.\nRole of Gas Technician 3\nIdentify Problems\nRecognize venting issues during inspection\nNotify Qualified Personnel\nAlert higher-level technicians about issues\nAssist with Corrections\nHelp qualified technicians implement solutions\nPrevent Problems\nInstall venting systems properly from the start\nNatural Draft Venting Principles\nHow Natural Draft Works\nNatural draft primarily occurs due to the pressure difference between the hot air and gases in a chimney or vent and the cooler, heavier air outside the chimney or vent.\nThe difference in pressure causes the hot gases to rise, thus producing a suction effect in the heat exchanger. This is sometimes called thermal draft.\nThis pressure difference is usually quite small—measured in 1/100ths of an inch of water column pressure. It can be reversed by pressures as low as 0.02 in w.c. (5 Pa).\nThe \"U-tube\" effect creates venting action in a natural draft system. Hot, light flue gases rise while cooler, denser air outside the appliance pushes the flue gases upward.\nConventional Natural Draft Venting\nCombustion\nFuel burns in the appliance, creating hot combustion gases\nHeat Exchange\nHeat transfers to the medium (air or water) while gases remain hot\nNatural Rise\nHot gases naturally rise through the vent due to buoyancy\nOutdoor Release\nCombustion products safely exit through the vent terminal\nCategory 1 Appliances\nCharacteristics\nCategory 1 appliances have a negative vent pressure and are less than 83% efficient. These appliances most commonly use natural draft venting.\nThey are vented into properly lined chimneys or factory-built vents. This is what you often call a conventional natural draft venting system.\nThe negative pressure in the vent helps draw combustion products away from the appliance. This system relies entirely on the natural buoyancy of hot gases to function properly.\nBalanced Flue Natural Draft Appliances\nSystem Design\nBalanced flue, direct vent appliances are vented into special venting systems that are designed and approved for use with the specific appliance.\nAlthough the vent pressure may be",

          "content": "HVAC Venting Systems: Principles and Practices\nWelcome to our comprehensive exploration of venting systems used in heating and cooling applications. This course is designed for HVAC technicians and students who want to understand the fundamental principles, components, and installation practices of proper venting systems. Throughout these lessons, we'll examine how venting systems safely remove combustion products while ensuring efficient appliance operation.\nBy the end of this course, you'll be able to identify different venting types, understand natural and mechanical draft systems, diagnose common venting problems, and implement proper installation techniques that comply with industry codes and standards.\nMK\nby Mike Kapin\nUnderstanding the Purpose of Venting Systems\nRemoval of Combustion Products\nVenting systems safely channel combustion gases from appliances to the outside atmosphere, preventing dangerous buildup of carbon dioxide, water vapor, nitrogen, and potentially carbon monoxide within occupied spaces.\nPreventing Condensation Damage\nProperly designed venting prevents water vapor in flue gases from condensing inside heat exchangers and vent pipes, which can cause corrosion and premature equipment failure unless specifically designed for condensate management.\nFire Hazard Protection\nVenting systems protect building structures from fire hazards by safely containing and directing hot flue gases away from combustible materials, using proper clearances and materials rated for high temperatures.\nFresh Air Supply\nAs combustion gases exit through the venting system, negative pressure draws fresh air to the burner, ensuring proper combustion and efficient appliance operation.\nThe History and Evolution of Venting Systems\n1\nAncient Venting\nEarly peoples built fires at the center of their dwellings, allowing smoke to exit through holes in the roof. Ventilation air entered through doors, windows, and unsealed openings, creating a primitive but functional draft system.\n2\nChimney Development\nThe development of chimneys represented a significant advancement, providing a dedicated pathway for smoke and combustion products while improving indoor air quality and reducing fire risks.\n3\nModern Sealed Buildings\nToday's virtually airtight buildings create new venting challenges. Modern HVAC systems require sophisticated venting designs to ensure proper air exchange while maintaining energy efficiency.\n4\nAdvanced Venting Technology\nContemporary venting systems integrate mechanical draft technologies, specialized materials, and engineered designs to maximize safety, efficiency, and performance in modern buildings.\nFlue Gas Composition and Properties\nFlue Gas Component\nProperties and Concerns\nCarbon Dioxide (CO₂)\nDoes not support combustion. When dissolved in water vapor, forms carbonic acid that can corrode steel venting pipes, requiring corrosion-resistant materials.\nWater Vapor (H₂O)\nProduced in significant quantities (a 100,000 BTU/h furnace produces approximately 200 ft³/h of water vapor). Can condense and cause corrosion when flue gas temperatures drop.\nNitrogen (N₂)\nColorless, odorless gas constituting 78% of atmosphere. Not harmful nor used for heating purposes, but takes up volume in the venting system.\nCarbon Monoxide (CO)\nProduct of incomplete combustion. Remains combustible and is deadly toxic, making proper venting essential for occupant safety.\nVenting System Failure Consequences\nOccupant Health Risks\nSpillage of CO₂ reduces oxygen levels, while CO spillage can cause poisoning. Both create potentially life-threatening conditions for building occupants.\nStructural Damage\nWater vapor spillage and condensation can damage building materials, leading to rot, mold, and deterioration of structural components.\nEquipment Damage\nAcidic condensation inside non-condensing appliances and vents causes premature equipment failure, reducing system lifespan and increasing maintenance costs.\nFire Hazards\nFlame rollout from combustion chambers and overheated vents near combustible materials create significant fire risks that can threaten the entire structure.\nIntroduction to Natural Draft Venting\nNatural draft venting harnesses the fundamental principle of thermal buoyancy to remove combustion products. This process, sometimes called thermal draft, occurs when hot, lighter flue gases rise through the venting system while cooler, denser air outside creates pressure that pushes the flue gases upward in a \"U-tube\" effect.\nCategory I appliances (those with negative vent pressure and efficiency less than 83%) typically use natural draft venting with properly lined chimneys or factory-built vents. Balanced flue, direct vent appliances also employ natural draft principles, allowing for effective venting without mechanical devices.\nThe pressure difference driving natural draft is quite small—measured in 1/100ths of an inch of water column pressure—making these systems sensitive to external factors. Understanding these factors is crucial for proper installation and troubleshooting.\nFactors Affecting Natural Draft Venting\nStack Temperature\nHigher average stack temperature increases draft\nOutdoor Temperature\nLower outdoor temperature increases draft\nStack Height\nGreater stack height increases draft\nThe theoretical draft in a stack is directly proportional to the absolute temperature difference between stack gas and surroundings, and to the height of the stack. Notably, draft does not directly depend on the stack diameter, though diameter affects flow resistance and velocity.\nTechnicians can influence stack temperature through several factors: controlling excess air entering the combustion chamber, maintaining proper heat exchange efficiency, ensuring appropriate flow rates of heated medium, and keeping heat exchangers clean. Vent material, diameter, configuration, and location also significantly impact venting effectiveness.\nComponents Affecting Stack Temperature\nHeat Transfer Efficiency\nThe efficiency of heat transfer from combustion gases to the heated medium (water or air) directly affects stack temperature. Higher efficiency appliances extract more heat, resulting in lower stack temperatures that may require special venting considerations.\nExcess Air Control\nThe amount of excess air entering the combustion chamber affects flame temperature and flow rate of flue gases. Lower excess air creates higher flame temperatures and improved heat transfer, but must be balanced with complete combustion requirements.\nHeat Medium Conditions\nThe temperature and flow rate of the heated medium (water or air) entering the heat transfer system affects the temperature differential driving heat exchange. Too cool a medium can rob flue gases of heat required for effective venting.\nHeat Exchanger Condition\nA clean heat exchanger, both inside and outside, maintains effective heat transfer. Dirt and deposits reduce heat transfer, resulting in elevated stack temperatures that waste energy and potentially create safety issues.\nVent System Design Factors\nVent Material Insulation\nMaterials with higher insulating value maintain stack temperature throughout the vent's travel to outdoors. This helps preserve venting action, especially in cold climates or long vent runs.\nProper vent caps also help retain heat in the system while preventing cold air infiltration, maintaining the thermal differential that drives natural draft.\nVent Diameter\nProper vent sizing is critical to maintain appropriate flue gas velocity and temperature. Undersized vents restrict flow, while oversized vents reduce velocity and temperature, inhibiting proper venting action.\nSizing must consider appliance input, vent height, lateral runs, and number of fittings to ensure optimal performance under all operating conditions.\nConfiguration and Location\nVent configuration should minimize resistance to flow by reducing lateral runs, directional changes, and restrictive fittings. Tall vertical vents with minimal elbows maximize draft.\nLocation matters too—vents exposed to outdoor temperatures lose heat more rapidly, reducing stack temperature and venting effectiveness. Interior installation is preferred when possible.\nDraft Control Equipment: Draft Hoods\nPurpose and Function\nMany domestic gas burners are atmospheric type and require a neutral over-fire draft in the combustion chamber. Draft hoods maintain this neutral pressure by allowing dilution air into the venting system, preventing excessive negative pressure.\nSystem Decoupling\nDraft hoods effectively decouple the venting system from the appliance, preventing venting conditions from directly affecting burner performance. This helps maintain stable combustion under varying draft conditions.\nSpillage Response\nWhen there's no draft, a backdraft, or blockage beyond the draft hood, flue gases exit out of the draft hood instead of entering the appliance. This \"spillage\" acts as a safety feature, preventing products of combustion from being forced back into the heat exchanger.\nInstallation Considerations\nDraft hoods are either built into gas appliances or installed as part of the vent connector. They should never be altered or modified, as changing the hood or skirt length affects the burner neutral pressure point, potentially causing incomplete combustion and carbon monoxide production.\nDraft Control Equipment: Barometric Dampers\nType and Application\nBarometric draft controls are used on gas appliances operating with controlled negative over-fire draft, typically converted boilers or furnaces fired by fan-assist or power conversion burners.\nSingle vs. Double Acting\nSingle-acting dampers swing in only to regulate stack draft and are generally not used for gas equipment except in some jurisdictions for gas-fired incinerators.\nDouble-Acting Function\nDouble-acting barometric dampers open both inward to regulate dilution air and outward to relieve down-draft and spillage, providing comprehensive draft control.\nAdjustment Requirements\nAdjustments depend on burne",
