          "content": "Chapter 1 covers the installation, operation, and types of water heaters and combination systems. Tankless water heaters are available in three main types: indoor power vent (uses fan to push flue gases, combustion air from inside space), indoor direct vent (combustion air from outdoors to sealed chamber, two pipes or concentric pipe through wall/roof), and outdoor (combustion air from immediate environment). Indoor units are Category 3 or Category 4 appliances with positive vent static pressure, utilizing stainless steel or plastic venting. Venting systems must be sized and installed per manufacturer literature with minimum number of fittings, and terminations per manufacturer, local codes, and CSA B149.1.\n\nRemoval and installation procedures are performed in three stages: obtaining permits, removal (shutdown/disconnection/removal of old unit), and installation (installation/start-up/adjustment of replacement unit). The removal procedure includes turning off gas and cold-water supply, opening hot-water faucet and drain valve, allowing heater to cool, disconnecting gas supply piping, disconnecting plumbing piping when drained, and removing heater.\n\nInstallation must be per manufacturer instructions and all applicable codes, referring to Clause 7.27 of CSA B149.1. Unless direct-vent type, water heaters shall not be installed in bedrooms, bathrooms, or sleeping areas. Installation clearances for underfired storage-type must be minimum 2 in (50 mm) at rear and sides, with ample clearance at front for lighting, servicing, cleaning, and adjustment. Drain valve, thermostat, and burners must be accessible for removal.\n\nCombustion air and venting requirements include adequate ventilation for oxygen consumption. For naturally-drafted units (except direct-vent), if installed in enclosed area, ventilation openings or air inlet must be provided per code. When water heater is used in combo heating system (except direct-vent), return-air inlets shall not be installed in same enclosure containing both air-handling unit and water heater. Return air ducts must be sealed to prevent infiltration from enclosure.\n\nDraft hood must be installed without alteration with relief openings unobstructed. Vent pipe run should be short with slight upward slope and few elbows. Clearances to combustible surfaces: single-wall vent 6 in (150 mm), Type B vent 1 in (25 mm), Type BH per venting manufacturer, sides of water heater at least 2 in (50 mm).\n\nWater heater should not be installed where water damage can result from leakage (especially multi-storey buildings). Installation must include means of directing leakage to suitable drain via pan. If supply water pressure exceeds code maximum or working pressure of tank, pressure-reducing valve must be installed on inlet supply line.\n\nWater-piping installation includes leveling heater, closing main water supply, releasing pressure and draining by opening faucets, installing fittings for cold/hot connections (markings identify inlet/outlet), checking cold-water inlet contains factory-furnished dip tube, and not soldering supply pipe directly to cold-water inlet. Cold-water inlet line must contain shut-off valve with union provided. NPC requires vacuum-relief valve in cold-water supply line between shut-off valve and cold-water inlet to prevent vacuum from imploding tank (storage tanks susceptible to external pressures, may collapse if internal pressure drops below 0 psig). If plastic piping used for water distribution, manufacturers recommend not connecting within 18 in (450 mm) of water heater; use minimum 18 in metallic piping.\n\nGas-piping installation per CSA B149.1 for type and size. Rating plate indicates gas type and maximum rated input. Remove burrs, oil, pipe compound, and contamination from pipe interior (foreign material can damage gas-control valve). Cut piping per good practices, ensure all connections gas-tight, avoid stressing gas control valve by supporting with wrench when attaching supply pipe. Slowly open gas shut-off valve and check all gas piping (including factory piping) for leaks using appropriate liquid solution or leak-detection device.\n\nVenting installation per Clause 8 of CSA B149.1 and manufacturer instructions. Filling procedure: close drain valve, open cold-water supply valve, open nearby hot-water faucet (remove aerator to avoid clogging) to allow air to escape, when steady stream flows tank is full, close faucet and replace aerator, check all water piping for leaks.\n\nInstallation checklist includes gas leak check (turn on main gas supply, relight other pilots, turn on heater shut-off valve, do not light pilot, do not use match or open flame, use liquid solution or leak-detection device, apply soap mixture to all joints, observe for soap bubbles indicating leaks, repair as necessary) and general installation check (at least 2 in clearance to combustibles, no water leakage, adequate ventilation, heater completely filled with all air expelled, gas piping conforms to codes, draft hood and vent pipe properly installed).\n\nPilot lighting instructions typically include turning pilot on-off dial to off, waiting five minutes when relighting, turning dial to pilot position, applying open flame to pilot opening and depressing pilot reset button for one minute until flame remains constant, turning dial to on position, and adjusting thermostat to desired temperature.\n\nDirect-fired storage heaters are most common for residential and low-demand commercial installations. Indirect-fired systems heat stored water using secondary heat-transfer fluid. Direct-fired storage heaters heat water via gas flame's hot products of combustion. Tankless water heaters provide water heated on demand, less space required, and greater efficiency (but not operation at lower firing rates). Not all fin-tube boilers suitable for heating potable water.\n\nDirect-vent water heaters differentiated by combustion air vented directly to unit from outdoors. Power-vent water heaters use motor-driven fan to remove products of combustion. Intermittent pilot used with power-vented units. Plastic venting material must meet ULC S636 standard. Condensing water heaters achieve high efficiencies by capturing latent heat.\n\nCombination systems provide domestic water heating and space heating. Water should be stored at minimum 140 °F (60 °C) to eliminate Legionella bacteria growth. At 140 °F, third-degree burn occurs in 4 seconds. Rod and tube aquastat maintains typical differential of 10 to 15 °F. ECO stands for Energy cut-off. FVIR (Flammable Vapour Ignition Resistant) technology makes residential storage-type heaters more resistant to accidents from mishandling gasoline or flammable materials. Pumps for circulating domestic (potable) water must be stainless steel or bronze. When connecting to water heater, minimum 18 in (450 mm) metallic piping should be installed before connecting to plastic water distribution piping.",

          "content": "Chapter 2 covers temperature and flow control devices used in combination heating systems. Closed-loop systems use non-potable water as heat transfer medium that cannot be released to atmosphere by opening faucet. Open systems have contact with atmosphere at some point.\n\nTemperature and flow-control devices include properly sized temperature and pressure-relief valve, expansion tank, check valve, vacuum-relief valve, mixing valve, circulating pump, and approved backflow preventer (in closed systems).\n\nTemperature and pressure-relief valve (T&P) is code requirement for all plumbing systems. T&P valve opens to safely discharge fluid before excessive pressures develop. Expansion tank contains increased volume of fluid when heated. Diaphragm-type expansion tank has internal diaphragm dividing tank into two chambers: lower chamber contains compressed air pre-pressurized by manufacturer (must be adjusted to match system-design pressure), upper chamber accommodates expanded volume of heated system fluid. Fluid entering tank causes diaphragm to flex, further compressing air in lower chamber. When fluid volume reduces due to cooling, fluid in expansion tank forced back into system by pressure exerted on diaphragm by compressed air.\n\nCheck valves prevent reverse flow but should not be confused with or substituted for approved backflow prevention assemblies (not designed or approved for cross-contamination prevention, backflow-prevention assemblies more elaborate, often require annual testing and maintenance). Most common type is swing check valve with hinged disc that swings open to allow flow in desired direction (works best in upright horizontal position only). Vertical check valve commonly called lift check. Other types incorporate spring and can be installed in any position. When fluid flow reverses, disc closes onto valve seat preventing backwards flow.\n\nVacuum-relief valves are normally open valves installed on cold-water inlet lines to storage tanks. Not a backflow device - purpose is to allow air to enter water system to prevent negative pressure in water heater storage tank. Any vacuum created opens vacuum-relief valve to draw in outside air to maintain pressure balance. At atmospheric pressure, water boils at 212 °F (100 °C); if pressure lower than atmospheric (as in vacuum), it boils and changes state to steam at lower temperature.\n\nMixing valve is thermostatic type used to blend cold water with hot water from tank to achieve lower temperature for domestic use. Circulating pump (circulator) moves fluid through hydronic system. Centrifugal-type pump most commonly used. Circulation pump control may be simple on-off switch for domestic hot water recirculating system or relay-type device. Relay operation: on call for heat, thermostat contacts close energizing coil of 24-V relay, normally open contacts of relay close to complete 110-V pump operating circuit; when desired temperature reached, thermostat contacts open, relay contacts open, and pump stops.\n\nAdditional requirements include no chemical additives in system, no water heater to replace existing boiler, water conditioning may be required in hard-water areas, backflow preventer required wherever potential for cross-contamination of potable and non-potable systems exists. Qualified installer/tester must install vacuum-relief valve and ensure provisions alleviate potential for bacterial growth within potable water system.\n\nSystem layouts show combination systems with storage-type water heater and tankless water heater for domestic water and fan-coil space heating. Notes specify all piping and components approved for potable use, all copper tubing type K or L, all plastic piping approved for potable use, if hot water above 140 °F (60 °C) mixing valve conforming to CSA B125.3 required to supply domestic hot water at 140 °F, for single or multiple space heating units/zones/loops cycle timer must circulate all water in space heating system once every 24 hours, other accessories or components may be used for different controls or required per local codes.\n\nStorage-type system includes hot water supply, cold water supply, return water, fan coil unit with hot water coil and hot water pump with cycle timer, thermometer, CGA approved combo hot water heater, connections for space heating for water heaters without side tappings (note: many municipalities do not allow optional piping method), water heater with side tappings for space heating, check valves, hot supply air duct for space heating, return air duct.\n\nTankless system includes tankless water heater, hot water supply, cold water supply, return water, fan coil unit with hot water coil and hot water pump with cycle timer, thermometer, domestic hot water 140 °F (60 °C), optional hot water storage tank, space heating thermostat, check valve, bronze body recirculating pump for storage tank with internal check valves, hot supply air duct, return air duct.\n\nWiring procedures for combination systems per manufacturer instructions and wiring diagrams. Wiring covered in detail in Hydronic heating systems unit. Low-voltage connections made to low-voltage wiring harness. Use insulated butt splices instead of wire nuts for neater, more reliable connections for low-voltage devices such as thermostats.",

          "content": "Chapter 3 covers systems sizing for water heaters and combination systems. Gas technicians do not design potable water systems (typically plumbers' work), but when sizing domestic hot-water heaters and allowing for combination system requirements, must consider several factors to ensure application needs are met. Important design considerations include accurate calculation of space-heating heat-loss requirements and proper sizing of water heaters and pumps.\n\nWater heater sizing information is basic guide for combination potable-water heating and space-heating applications. Each building's domestic hot-water requirements vary. Proper sizing considers capacity of water heater in gallons and Btu input of water heater.\n\nDetermining water heater capacity uses minimum 40 imp gal/48 US gal (180 L) featuring high-recovery or high-efficiency gas-fired water heater. Table 3-1 indicates air handler and water heater combinations adequate for most areas: 600-800 CFM (280-380 L/sec) requires 40 imp gal/48 US gal (180 L); 1000-1200 CFM (470-570 L/sec) requires 50 imp gal/60 US gal (225 L); 1400-1600 CFM (660-755 L/sec) requires two 40 imp gal (180 L) twinned, or one high-input 50 imp gal (225 L), or one 72-75 imp gal/90 US gal (327-341 L); 2000 CFM (940 L/sec) requires any combination having at least 105 000 Btu/h (30.8 kW) output.\n\nDetermining water heater input based on calculated heat loss of building and water heater recovery efficiency rating. Perform heat loss calculation per approved industry engineering practices (importance cannot be overstated). Local climate and temperature variations influence building heat loss and input calculations. Water heater in area with long cold winters requires more energy than one in milder climate. Multiplication factor reflecting local climatic conditions factored into calculation. Always consult local information sources for proper climate multiplication factors. Examples for reference only: mild climates Input = calculated heat loss × 1.51, colder climates Input = calculated heat loss × 1.58.\n\nSpace heating requirements: minimum capacity of appliance or portion used for space heating based on calculated heat loss of building. Where air handler is only heat source, size accordingly. Design and installation per approved industry engineering practices or manuals published by HRAI, American Society of Heating Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), or Air Conditioning Contractors of America (ACCA).\n\nSelect air handler with heating output exceeding calculated space-heating loss of building and cooling coil sized to match outdoor condensing unit. Heating output of air handler or hot-water coil less than hot-water heater. If water heater undersized, heating capacity of air handler less than rated output.\n\nDomestic hot-water heating: minimum capacity of appliance or portion for supplying domestic hot water based on approved industry engineering practices or publication from ASHRAE, HRAI, or American Society of Plumbing Engineers (ASPE).\n\nCombination space and domestic hot-water heating capacities calculated using worksheet \"Combo-system HWT/FAN coil sizing\". Design and installation per approved industry engineering practices. Designer may use basic drawings in approved publications showing basic principles of proposed combination system. Other accessories or components may be required per local codes.\n\nCSA B149.1 has two stipulations for location and operation of water heater in combo heating system. Clause 7.27.6 (Return and combustion air): Except for direct-vent water heaters, when water heater used in combo heating system, return-air inlets shall not be installed in same enclosure containing both air-handling unit and water heater; adequate combustion air provided for water heater. Clause 7.27.7 (Return air infiltration): When return air duct(s) of air-handling unit in combo heating system installed in enclosure where any spillage-susceptible appliances located, shall be sealed to air-handling unit casing, and joints in ducting sealed to prevent infiltration of air from enclosure into return-air ducting.\n\nFan-coil combination systems may have storage-type water heater or tankless water heater. Sample combination-system sizing based on dwelling with two bedrooms, two bathrooms, and 21 000 Btu/h heat loss (typical domestic hot water usage rates). If dwelling has additional hot-water requirements (such as hot tub), system must be designed to meet those requirements.\n\nSample water heater specification: 50 gal (225 L) storage capacity, 50 000 Btu/h (15 kW) input, 76% recovery efficiency, 38 000 Btu/h (11 kW) output. Referring to worksheet, designed domestic draw of 60 gal (273 L) satisfied by selected conventional combination hot-water heater providing 29 700 Btu/h (8.7 kW) for fan coil to meet 24 150 Btu/h (7.1 kW) space heat-loss requirement.\n\nPump sizing: most combination systems require circulation pump to move water through system. Installation per applicable codes and air handler manufacturer's installation instructions. Circulation pumps should be stainless or bronze-body centrifugal-type pumps designed for hydronic heating systems and sized to meet system requirements. Two factors determine properly sized pump selection: flow rate and pressure loss. After determining system flow rate and pressure loss, use manufacturer's pump performance curve data to select proper circulator. Pump performance curve shows relationship between flow rate and pressure loss. Pump sizing covered in greater detail in Hydronic heating system unit.\n\nCirculators generally sized per rule-of-thumb: flow rate of pump should be one USGPM per 10 000 Btu/h heat output required, allowing 1 ft of friction pressure loss per 40 ft of pipe run.\n\nFlow rate refers to amount of water circulated through system. Determined by heat required and temperature difference between water leaving heater and water returning after releasing heat. Required heat measured in Btu/h per heat-loss calculation for building. Flow rate traditionally measured in USGPM.\n\nPressure loss: flow of water through piping system must overcome resistance due to friction. Pump must overcome this resistance (pressure loss) to maintain required flow rate. After determining flow rate, piping size, and run length, calculate pressure loss. Pressure loss normally measured in feet of head water column (ft. hd. w.c.). To select appropriate pump, must know how much pressure pump develops for given gpm flow rate. Information found on manufacturers' pump curve charts.\n\nEach pump has own pump curve, although more than one pump model may appear on single chart. All circulator manufacturers publish these curves for circulator models offered. To reduce number of circulator models needed while covering wide range of performance requirements, most manufacturers offer circulators capable of operating at three different speeds. Desired speed selected using external switch on circulator's junction box. Each operating speed has corresponding pump curve.",

          "content": "Chapter 4 covers troubleshooting and servicing of water heaters and combination systems. All tankless water heaters have flow switch or flow sensor in cold-water supply. Purpose is to ensure sufficient water flow to appliance to prevent damage. Depending on make and model, flow rate to activate flow switch can be as low as 0.4 USGPM (1.5 L/min) or as high as 0.9 USGPM (3.4 L/min).\n\nTo test flow switch, check switch closes contacts at minimum flow rate per manufacturer literature by viewing display screen if model displays flow rates or performing flow test and slowly opening hot water faucet. Flow test procedure: use graduated container and time fill rate, once minimum flow rate established ensure sufficient voltage at both terminals of flow switch (consult manufacturer as voltage can be AC or DC depending on make and model), if voltage correct de-energize appliance and test resistance through flow switch by disconnecting wires and connecting ohmmeter (should be no resistance through switch when water flowing).\n\nNon-electrical problems and servicing: gas manifold pressure problems can lead to stacking, poor burner flame, and condensation, which cause further problems. Use manometer to check manifold pressure (U-tube type and digital manometers most accurate). Rating plate lists correct manifold pressure. Connect manometer to manifold for pressure test.\n\nMain gas pressure regulator forms part of water heater control unit, adjusted per manufacturer specifications at factory. Adjustment screw in centre of control unit dial. Some control units have sealed adjustment (not possible to change; if out of calibration, replace). If adjustable, remove regulator adjustment screw cap by inserting screwdriver into screw slot rotating counterclockwise, use small screwdriver to remove sealant from adjustment screw top, connect manometer to test outlet of control unit, with burner operating adjust gas pressure as necessary (turn adjustment screw clockwise to increase pressure, counterclockwise to decrease), replace adjustment screw cap when finished. If manifold pressure correct and input clocked and incorrect, check if orifice correct size per rating plate. If incorrect size, change it.\n\nStacking check procedure: turn off cold-water supply, draw small amount of water from drain valve and check/note temperature, turn on cold-water supply, draw water from any hot-water faucet and let run for minute or two then check/note temperature. If temperature difference greater than 25 °F (14 °C), stacking condition exists. Five causes of stacking and corrections: too long dip tube (remove and check length per manufacturer specifications, correct length or replace), excessive liming of tank (covered later), leaky faucets from water tank (repair faucet, leaks may not be visible such as in drain line, remove drain line to check), frequent draws of hot water (limit number of times hot water drawn), repeated short-cycling of control unit (replace control unit).\n\nRemoving dip tube method: turn off cold-water supply (do not use any water until repair finished), turn control unit to pilot position, open hot-water faucet and wait for water to stop flowing (very important), close faucet, draw 4-5 buckets of water off system through drain cock, cut copper tubing between shut-off valve and cold-water inlet to tank, remove dip tube, make any soldered connections required on tubing before attaching new or resized dip tube to system, cut dip tube to manufacturer's recommended length or replace with longer one, apply Teflon tape or non-metallic pipe dope to dip tube threads and install in tank, resolder copper (when soldering last joint wrap wet rag around pipe to prevent heat reaching dip tube), turn on cold-water supply, turn on hot-water faucet until water flows continuously, check for water leaks, turn control unit to on position (if replacing anode use same procedure).\n\nRelief-valve discharge: problems causing combination temperature and pressure (T&P) relief valve to discharge include stacking (refer to previous section), too high temperature setting for off position on control unit (recalibrate control unit, if doesn't work replace), control unit sticking in on position (check by rotating dial on and off few times, if sticking in on position replace), lime buildup on T&P relief valve (replace relief valve).\n\nRelief-valve replacement: turn main gas valve off, draw off enough hot water to ensure water at control unit location is cold, turn cold-water inlet valve off, open hot-water faucet until no water flows (very important), close hot-water faucet, apply non-metallic pipe dope to thread of replacement valve, place bucket under point working at to prevent water damage, remove faulty valve, insert new valve into tapping and tighten, turn on cold-water supply, turn on hot-water faucet until water starts to flow, turn on gas and check for leaks, relight pilot and check manifold pressure (also use this method to replace control unit or drain valve).\n\nLow water temperature (not same as lack or absence of hot water): factors and solutions include burner may be clogged (clean burner), orifice may be too small (check recommended size on rating plate and resize), gas pressure may be too low (increase gas pressure), temperature setting on control unit set too low (should have been checked first, increase temperature setting), too many people using water tank (water not getting enough time to reach desired temperature, recommend replace with bigger tank if possible in space), control unit may be out of calibration (check if out, recalibrate per procedure below).\n\nRecalibrating control unit: check calibration by drawing off enough hot water to ensure burner operating, allow thermostat to cycle burner off, manually turn thermostat dial to 130 °F (54 °C) mark, turn off cold-water supply, check hot-water temperature at drain valve. If thermostat more than 20 °F (8 °C) out of calibration, need to recalibrate.\n\nCalibration procedure: turn temperature dial to 130 °F (54 °C) mark (if water temperature so high burner doesn't come on, run enough hot water from faucet to cause thermostat to turn burner on, allow burner to operate until thermostat shuts off), close off cold-water supply, open nearest hot-water faucet to break air lock, slowly open drain valve until flow just sufficient to cover thermometer bulb, wait for temperature on thermometer to stabilize and note, close drain valve, close hot-water faucet and turn cold-water supply back on, turn temperature dial to correspond to measured temperature (note 140 °F mark, each notch on rim of dial corresponds to 10 °F/4 °C in either direction), remove temperature dial and mark location of stop and replace dial (careful not to turn dial when removing and replacing), turn dial clockwise until control snaps on, turn dial counterclockwise slowly until control just snaps off, remove temperature dial while holding stop to prevent rotation and carefully loosen stop adjustment nut, taking care not to move temperature-adjusting screw turn stop until corresponds with reference mark made, replace temperature dial (actual water temperature should now be indicated, good procedure to check water temperature again by repeating steps 2-7).\n\nCheck with AHJ for maximum domestic water temperature. At 140 °F (60 °C) water temperature, risk of scalding can occur in less than 5 sec, whereas at 120 °F (49 °C) risk reduced.\n\nInsufficient hot water: some causes same as water not hot enough. Reasons and solutions include temperature dial set below required temperature (set dial to required temperature), control unit out of calibration (recalibrate control unit), manifold pressure lower than rating on plate (adjust manifold pressure), tank excessively limed (replace tank), dip tube broken or cracked (replace dip tube), dip tube installed incorrectly (reinstall dip tube), dip tube has incorrect length (install per manufacturer specifications), heater capacity insufficient for number of people (recommend larger tank), second dip tube installed on hot water outlet (remove this dip tube), hot and cold-water lines crossed (repipe these lines), main burner flame dirty or carboned (clean burner or correct venting and gas-input deficiencies by adjusting gas pressure or orifice size, may also need to clean orifice), heat loss from long runs of uninsulated pipe (insulate long runs), differential on control unit out of range (replace control unit).\n\nVenting spillage of fumes can result from problem in venting system. If appliance naturally drafted, check: draft hood required and in place (if not add to system, ensure not damaged or altered), vent working by ensuring burner on at least 10 min, light smoke generator and hold at draft hood opening (smoke should be drawn into draft hood, if not check for blockage in draft hood and remove, negative pressure in building may also prevent venting due to lack of makeup air), venting pipes may be broken or have too many bends (needs fixing, consult manufacturer literature for correct venting layout), venting system may not be terminated properly leading to positive pressure in vent (may happen only occasionally such as windy days, if problem termination requires fixing), water heater may not be hot enough (warm air unable to rise naturally through system, advise customer to avoid intermittent use of appliance or increase system temperature).\n\nIf system temperature must be increased to correct cold flue situation, temperature-control valve may have to be installed. Problems with venting system can be very serious leading to spillage of toxic gases including carbon monoxide. Category 3 and 4 positive-pressure venting systems can also experience venting problems requiring careful consideration for safe installations (covered in detail in Venting practices unit).\n\nWater leaks: ten main areas to check include anode rod fitting (use cotton swab between jacket opening and fitting to wipe area, if leak indicated remove valve and repair with pipe joint compound using same procedure as removing drain valve), draft hood and flue (water can be result of rainwater leaking in, also check for condensation which may cause further problems), piping connections and fittings (if leak turn off water and gas supplies and drain tank properly, disconnect piping, apply pipe joint compound, and replace), drain valve outlet (leak can be from bad gasket, loose packing nut, or valve slightly open, tighten handle first, if persists valve faulty and needs replacement similar to T&P relief valve except must completely drain tank), drain valve at tank (insert cotton swab between jacket opening and fitting to wipe area), water at relief outlet of T&P relief valve (often results from T&P relief valve operating properly, may also be dirt on valve seat needing cleaning, if valve not piped to open drain water can be mistaken for leaking heater), water pipe (often condensation and dripping water seen on pipes in humid weather not result of leak, if pipes leaking need fixing or replacement), heater bottom and floor (if water first check all possible leaking devices such as humidifiers then check for leaking water lines and ground seepage, water may also be result of condensation, loose connections, or relief valve, must find cause before replacing heater), combustion chamber (water usually result of condensation of flue gases, not leak).\n\nAnalyzing malfunctions: condensation (scaling or corrosion indicator of condensation forming). Causes of unwanted condensation and resolutions: manifold pressure too low (check manifold pressure, if measured pressure lower than stated on rating plate adjust), main burner orifice blocked or smaller than recommended size (if blocked clean, check recommended size on rating plate, if smaller install correct-sized orifice), flue has obstruction (if found remove, ensure draft adequate and perform flue-gas analysis). When storage-type water heater initially activated and water in tank cold, condensation may form, but once most water heated condensation should cease.\n\nLiming: water contains impurities. As more heat applied, more minerals (calcium and magnesium) removed from water. Minerals build up as calcium carbonate (limescale) on tank bottom. Buildup acts as insulator and reduces efficiency causing higher stack (vent) temperatures. One sign of liming is rumbling and crackling noise from tank caused by water penetrating limescale layer and meeting hot surface (small amounts of water heat quickly and flash to steam, small \"explosion\" causes rumbling and crackling sound). Water softener can prevent limescale formation (reduces hardness minerals in water).\n\nMeasures to resolve lime buildup: if lime buildup not excessive can clean, if tank excessively limed must replace. Deliming procedure: shut off power, gas, and water supply to tank, completely drain tank, remove drain valve and install 6-in nipple in place, remove anode, if no other apparent opening remove either hot or cold-water nipple, use small pressure washer to flush out as much scale and lime as possible by inserting through one hole and shining light through other hole to see, once removed as much as possible plug nipple at drain valve and add muriatic acid or pickling vinegar to tank and allow to stand, after deliming solution stood unplug nipple and allow tank to drain, use pressure washer again to flush tank (as drain about one inch off tank bottom cannot get all lime out but should get most), once finished washing flush tank with 3-5 gallons water to remove all traces of deliming solution, replace drain valve, anode, and any other removed parts, turn on water, fill tank with water, turn on power and gas, start water heater, remove faucet aerators, flush out hot-water lines, replace faucet aerators.\n\nCorrosion: use anode to prevent corrosion in tank. If tank corroding, possible that water softener with incorrect pH added to tank (removing too many impurities, must replace with water softener with correct pH) or anode not working (need to replace). Flue and vent system may also experience corrosion. If air for combustion contains certain chemical vapours that break down into acids during combustion process and bond with water vapour of fuel gas, these acids corrode flue and vent systems. Common chemicals: spray-can repellents, cleaning solvents, bleaches, refrigerants, swimming pool chemicals, calcium, sodium chloride (salt), waxes, and process chemicals. Make every effort to prevent these substances from contacting flue and vent system or air for combustion.\n\nProduction of carbon monoxide: carbon monoxide is colourless toxic gas. If inhaled in high enough concentration can cause death. One problem is invisible with no taste or odour, extremely hard to detect. Most common circumstance of carbon monoxide formation is when insufficient oxygen to completely burn fuel gas, leaving some fuel in flue gas. Figure 4-12 shows simple diagram of incomplete combustion forming carbon monoxide.\n\nAnother circumstance leading to carbon monoxide formation is when combustion temperature of fuel gas too low. For natural gas, combustion process must maintain temperature of approximately 1200 °F (649 °C). If flame quenched below that temperature (e.g., cooled due to too much excess air or contact with cooler surface), results in incomplete combustion and production of carbon monoxide.\n\nIf venting blocked in any way or gases not properly vented, flue gases unable to reach outdoors and remain in room. Flue gas spillage can recirculate through combustion chamber resulting in lack of combustion air. There is incomplete combustion of fuel gas and thus further buildup of carbon monoxide (problems with venting systems discussed earlier). Improperly vented appliance requires immediate correction to venting system, or appliance needs decommissioning, replacing (or both).\n\nAssignment questions cover electrical testing: thermocouple open-circuit test expected reading 30 mV, thermocouple must deenergize pilotstat coil within 60 seconds, water heater equipped with ECO activates when temperature exceeds 200 °F (94 °C), water heaters equipped with rod-and-tube-type thermostatic gas controls have TCO and ECO wired in series with safety shut-off valve, closed-limit switch should have no resistance, to determine integrity of flammable vapour sensor measure resistance, if temperature of NTC thermistor decreases its resistance increases, to ensure adequate (minimum) flow of water through heat exchanger tankless water heaters use flow sensor, to measure manifold pressure use manometer, hardness contributes to lime scale formation, muriatic acid used to remove limescale.",

          "content": "CSA Unit 18 - Water Heaters \nand Combination Systems \nChapter 1\nInstallation of new and replacement gas water heaters is a normal part of \na gas technician's/fitter's duties. The types of heaters, controls, \ncomponents, and piping systems vary greatly as do the installation \nrequirements for each type. It is important for the gas technician/fitter to \nbe able to identify and select the proper water heater and related \nequipment required for an application and perform the work in \naccordance with applicable Codes and manufacturer's instructions.\nMK by Mike Kapin\nCreated\nCopywrite 2025\nInstallation Requirements\nCSA B149.1\nThe Natural Gas and \nPropane Installation Code \nspecifies requirements for \nwater heaters in Clause 7 \n(Installation of specific \ntypes of appliances) and \nClause 8 (Venting systems \nand air supply for \nappliances).\nNational Plumbing \nCode of Canada\nThe NPC specifies the \nrequirements for hot water \ntank installations, \nparticularly regarding shut-\noff valves, relief valves, and \nthermal expansion.\nManufacturer's Instructions\nCompliance with manufacturer's recommendations and \ninstructions is a code requirement and is necessary for safe and \nefficient water heater installation and servicing.\nCode Requirements for Water Heaters\nLocation Requirements\nA water heater, unless of the direct-vent \ntype, shall not be installed in a \nbathroom, bedroom, or any enclosure \nwhere sleeping accommodation is \nprovided.\nRelief Valve Requirements\nThe temperature and pressure relief \ndevice on a tank type water heater shall \nhave a discharge pipe of a size at least \nequal to the nominal size of the device \noutlet. The discharge pipe shall \nterminate not more than 12 in (300 mm) \nabove the floor.\nClearance Requirements\nThe minimum clearance from \ncombustible material for an underfired \nstorage-type water heater shall be 2 in \n(50 mm), and the minimum clearance \nfor any other type of water heater shall \nbe 6 in (150 mm).\nAir Supply Requirements\nSmall Water Heaters\nAn outdoor air supply shall not be required for a single water heater with an input of 50,000 Btuh (15 kW) or less within an \nenclosure or structure where there are no other appliances that require an air supply.\nEnclosed Heaters\nWhen an appliance is located within an enclosure, permanent openings must be provided to allow communication \nbetween the enclosure and the rest of the structure.\nOpening Size\nAn opening shall have a free area of not less than 1 in² per 1000 Btu/h (2225 mm² per kW) of the total input of all \nappliances within the enclosure.\nOpening Location\nThe opening shall be located not more than 18 in (450 mm) or less than 6 in (150 mm) above floor level.\nNational Plumbing Code Requirements\nClause 2.6.1.3 (7)\nEvery pipe that supplies water to a hot water tank shall be \nprovided with a shut-off valve located close to the tank.\nClause 2.6.1.7 (1)\nA storage-type service water heater must be equipped with a \npressure relief valve designed to open when the water pressure in \nthe tank reaches the rated working pressure.\nClause 2.6.1.7 (2)\nStorage-type service water heaters must be equipped with a \ntemperature relief valve with a temperature sensing element \nlocated within the top 150 mm of the tank.\nClause 2.6.1.7 (3)\nA pressure-relief valve and temperature-relief valve may be \ncombined (commonly referred to as a \"T & P\" Valve).\nClause 2.6.1.7 (7)\nA shut-off valve is not permitted on the pipe between any tank \nand the relief valves or on the discharge lines from such relief \nvalves.\nTypes of Water Heaters\nDirect-Fired Heaters\nHeat from the gas flame's hot products \nof combustion are in direct contact with \na tank or pipe containing the water to be \nheated.\nIndirect Water Heating\nHeat from the gas flame's hot products \nof combustion does not heat the water \ndirectly. A fluid (heat transfer fluid) \nheated by a secondary appliance heats \nthe stored water.\nUnder-Fired Storage\nThe most common type of gas-fired \nwater heater, where the burner, storage \ntank, outer jacket, insulation, and \ncontrols are combined into one unit.\nTankless (On-Demand)\nThese appliances heat water on demand \ninstead of storing heated water in a tank, \noffering continuous hot water supply \nwithin their rated capacity.\nMore Water Heater Types\nDirect-Vent\nCombustion air is supplied directly from the outdoors by enclosed ductwork \nconnected directly to the heater. The heater's combustion products are also \nvented directly to the outdoors.\nPower-Vented\nUsed for installations where higher efficiencies are desired or when adequate \nvertical venting through a chimney or B vent is impractical. An electric motor-\ndriven exhaust fan is typically connected to a certified venting system.\nCondensing\nDesigned to achieve very high levels of thermal efficiency by reclaiming latent \nheat, allowing these appliances to achieve efficiencies well over 90%.\nCombination Units\nDesigned to provide both domestic water heating and space heating, consisting \nof a heat source, space heating unit, circulating equipment, and control devices.\nUnder-Fired Storage Water Heaters\nConstruction\nIn a direct-fired storage heater, the gas flame's hot products \nof combustion heat the water by conduction through the \ntank bottom and flue surfaces. The flue acts as a heat \nexchanger and as a vent for the products of combustion.\nFeatures\n•\nMost common type of gas-fired water heater\n•\nBurner, storage tank, outer jacket, insulation, and \ncontrols combined into one unit\n•\nStorage tank serves as a heat exchanger\n•\nTypically available in sizes up to 75 US gallons (300 L) for \nresidential use\nTankless (On-Demand) Water \nHeaters\nOperation Sequence\nWhen a hot water tap is opened, water flow through the tankless water heater detects \nthe call for hot water.\nControl Response\nThe water flow sensor sends a signal to the control board, which monitors incoming \nwater temperature, desired water temperature, and the calculated difference \nbetween the two.\nHeating Process\nThe gas flow into the burner assembly is modulated, the electronic ignition \nsequence begins, and water is heated to the desired temperature as it circulates \nthrough the heat exchanger.\nShutdown\nWhen the hot water tap is turned off, the tankless water heater sequentially \nshuts down and is placed in a standby mode pending the next call for hot \nwater.\nTankless Water Heater Benefits\nEnergy Efficiency\nThey have the potential to be 25-30% more energy efficient than storage \nheaters.\nLonger Lifespan\nWorking life has the potential to be longer than a tank-type hot water heater, \nand they are repairable.\nContinuous Hot Water\nThey provide a continuous supply of hot water within their design capacity.\nSpace Saving\nThey take up less space and can be wall mounted.\nTankless Water Heater Considerations\nFlow Rate Limitations\nOn-demand production of hot water directly depends on \nthe temperature rise required for the installation. The colder \nthe inlet water temperature from the source, the lower the \nrate of production available from tankless water heaters.\nFor example, a 70°F water temperature rise may be possible \nat a flow rate of 5 gallons per minute. Higher flow rates or \ncolder groundwater temperatures require higher input \ncapacity water heaters.\nGas Supply Requirements\nTankless water heaters have a very high firing rate (normally \n100,000 to 200,000 Btu/h) compared to under-fired \nstorage water heaters (normally 35,000 to 80,000 Btu/h). \nAs a result, the size of gas pipe to a tankless water heater is \ntypically larger.\nProper sizing of gas lines is critical for ensuring adequate \nperformance of tankless units.\nCopper-Fin-Tube Water Heaters\nDescription\nCopper-fin-tube water heaters used for direct heating or \ncopper-fin-tube boilers with separate storage tanks can be \nused in residential, commercial, and industrial applications. \nThey require certification as a water heater as they will be \nheating potable water.\nConstruction\nThis type of heater consists of a copper-fin-tube heat \nexchanger, enclosed in an insulated sheet-metal outer \ncasing. Cold water enters the heat exchanger coil through \nan inlet port, is heated, and may be stored for later use.\nDirect-Vent Water Heaters\nCombustion Air Supply\nA direct-vent water heater's combustion air is supplied \ndirectly from the outdoors by enclosed ductwork connected \ndirectly to the heater. The heater's combustion products are \nalso vented directly to the outdoors.\nVenting Configurations\n•\nConcentric (coaxial) venting system with a smaller-\ndiameter duct centrally located in the larger \ncombustion-air intake duct\n•\nTwo separate pipes: one for combustion air intake and \nanother for flue gas venting\nEnsuring adequate and secure venting is of primary \nimportance for direct-vent installations.\nPower-Vented Water Heaters\nApplications\nUsed for installations where higher efficiencies are desired, when adequate vertical venting through a chimney or B vent is \nimpractical, or when the heater location makes power venting necessary.\nConstruction\nAn electric motor-driven exhaust fan, mounted on top of the water heater, is typically connected to a certified ULC S636 plastic \nventing system, which conveys the products of combustion to the outdoors.\nOperation\nThe pressure created by the fan induces a draft that pulls dilution air into the draft control openings at the top of the heater. The gas \nvalve is interlocked to a differential pressure switch that verifies the venter fan's operation before allowing the gas valve to open.\nIgnition System\nStanding pilots are not used on these types of water heaters because it comes with a mechanical venting system. Intermittent pilot \nsystems or electronic direct ignition systems light the main burner.\nPower-Vented Installation Requirements\nMust Do\n•\nUse ULC S636 plastic gas vent pipe as required by Clause \n8.9.6 of CSA B149.1\n•\nEnsure the venting system services the water heater only\n•\nTerminate venting in a horizontal run to the outdoors\n•\nSecure vertical and horizontal piping runs to the building \nstructur",

Combination systems\nOverview\nPurpose\nMost occupied buildings have a supply of domestic hot water and equipment for central heating.\nCombining the two systems is sometimes the most economical and efficient way to provide both\nservices. Because the popularity of this type of system is increasing, the gas technician/fitter\nmust be able to identify, select, and install components and controls that will ensure both the\ndomestic hot water and space heating requirements of the system are met.\nObjectives\nAt the end of this chapter, you will be able to:\n• describe installation requirements for combination systems;\n• describe types of combination systems;\n• describe system layout; and\n• describe wiring procedures.\nTerminology\nTerm Abbreviation Definition\n(Symbol)\nNon-potable Water that is not safe to drink\nPotable Water that is safe to drink\nInstallation requirements\nGeneral requirements\nSpecial Note: Connections made to gas appliances that include connections to the potable\nwater system must meet local, provincial, and municipal code requirements and will typically\nfall outside of the scope of a gas technician/fitter's practice in most provinces.\nIt is the responsibility of the gas technician/fitter to comply with all codes, as well as their local\ntrade regulations. In most jurisdictions within Canada, the only individual permitted to perform\ninstallation, alteration, or repair on any part of a plumbing system is a licensed Red Seal\nPlumber or Registered Plumbing Apprentice.\nSeveral associations across Canada provide guidance regarding the installation of combination\npotable water heating and space heating systems. National Resources Canada publishes a\nwater heater guide that outlines the pros and cons of using combination systems. Many\nprovinces have issued public information bulletins in an attempt to clarify necessary provisions\nfor these systems. The Canadian Institute for Plumbing and Heating (CIPH) is an association of\nmanufacturers that promotes the correct use of certified equipment and supports recognized\nindustry standards for water heating.\nCSA B214 contains minimum requirements for combination heating systems. The certified\ncombination water heater must be listed and marked to the appropriate ANSI/CSA standard\nindicating that it can be used in a dual-purpose application .\nThe Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Institute of Canada (HRAI) has developed a\nresource document of suggested best practice with regards to combination systems. The Unified\nCanadian Guideline for Integrated (Combination) Heating Systems could be a valuable resource\nfor qualified individuals that install combination systems as it summarizes several existing\nStandards and Code requirements. Included in the HRAI publication are the following list of\nrequirements:\n• These systems consist of a certified combination storage-type or a certified tankless potable\nwater heater used in conjunction with a fan -coil (ducted) heating system, hydronic baseboard\nsystem, and/or a hydronic radiant slab heating system, and is intended for space heating\napplications of not more than 75 000 Btu/h (22 kW).\n• Combination system components must be selected and sized to meet and maintain the total\ncalculated demands for hot water service and space heating heat loss requirements.\n• Domestic water heaters incorporated in combination heating systems must be certified and\nlabelled as being \"Suitable for water (potable) and space heating.\"\n• All components in the combination heating system or on the potable water side of a heat\nexchanger shall have a design pressure of not less than 1035 kPa (150 psi) and shall be able\nto withstand a continuous water temperature of 71 °C (160°F) and a short-term exposure of 99\n°C (210°F).\n• Ventilation air, which must be introduced into the building in accordance with the Building\nCode, must be heated and this will affect the overall system design.\n• Piping and components of the combination system that contain potable water must comply\nwith the requirements of the applicable local plumbing code, or in its absence, the NPC.\n• All appliances, accessories, components, equipment, or materials used in an installation must\nbe of a type and rating approved for the specific application for which they are used.\n• The water heating appliance and the fan coil unit must be certified by an approved agency,\nsuch as CSA Group, and labelled \"Suitable for water (potable) and space heating.\"\n• Ferrous materials (those containing iron) must not be used for potable water applications.\n• The use of non-potable chemicals is prohibited in potable water systems.\n• Combination systems may not be connected to any heating systems or components\npreviously used for non-potable water heating systems.\n• A pump-cycle timer must be installed to circulate all water contained in the fan coil space\nheating piping and components at least once every 24 hours. The timer may be factory\ninstalled in the air handling unit.\nQualifications and responsibility\nQualified gas technicians/fitters must complete all installations in a skillful, thorough manner. Pay\ncareful attention to the mechanical aspects of the work, to the layout of the installation, and\nproper instructions to the end-user:\n• Gas technicians/fitters performing installation, service, and maintenance work on combination\nsystems must be properly trained and qualified to do so. All work must be done in accordance\nwith Trade and Apprenticeship Acts and/or fuel certification licenses applicable to the\njurisdiction in which the work is being performed. For example, in most provinces, any work\nbeyond the immediate piping of the gas-fired appliance connections are the responsibilities of\na licensed Red Seal Plumber or registered plumbing apprentice.\n• The installation technician/fitter must ensure that the appliance, accessory, component, or\nequipment installed complies with all Code requirements. The technician/fitter initially\nactivating the appliance must ensure that it is in safe working order.\n• The installer must instruct the end-user in the safe and proper operation of all the appliances\nand equipment installed and supply the end-user with the appropriate manufacturer's\noperation and maintenance instructions.\nManufacturer's and other design requirements\nAll appliances, accessories, components, equipment, or any other item must be installed in\naccordance with the manufacturer's installation instructions and approved trade practices,\nincluding the following . Where a conflict exists between the manufacturer's installation\ninstructions and applicable Codes, the Code requirements must be followed, unless otherwise\napproved by the authority having jurisdiction (AHJ).\n• Existing non-potable hydronic systems, or parts taken from or connected to these systems,\nmust not be connected to potable water combination systems.\n• No chemicals, such as those used in a typical boiler-heated system, may be added to the\ncombination system.\n• Provision must be made to allow the entire combination system to be drained.\n• Only potable water may be used to test the combination system, and the system must be\nflushed before being put into service.\n• All components of the combination system must be installed with provision for ready access\nfor inspection, maintenance, repair, and cleaning, in accordance with the manufacturer's\noperation and maintenance instructions.\n• The air conditioning system must be installed in such a manner that any component of the air\nconditioning system will not obstruct service or removal of the water heater or other\ncomponents.\n• The installer must affix a warning label, in plain view of the consumer, which states that the\nwater temperature controls should not be adjusted or tampered with by the end-user.\nCombo performance specification summary\nCSA Combo Performance Specification Summary (refer to CAN/CSA P.9) applies to forced-air\ncombo heating systems. This Standard allows mechanical designers to:\n• select and specify an efficiently and appropriately sized combination system; and\n• to provide the installer with a table of requirements and selected system ratings and the\nmanufacturer's P.9 performance summary and system schematic.\nIt is important to use the CAN/CSA P.9 efficiency ratings as simply knowing the efficiency of a\nwater heater in water heating mode only does not provide useful information on the efficiency of a\ncombination system in space heating mode.\nThe National Building Code of Canada (and some provincial building codes) recently set a\nminimum requirement for systems using the CAN/CSA P.9 Thermal Performance Factor {TPF).\nTPF defines the gas-use efficiency based on both space and water heating test ratings. Higher\nvalues equate to higher efficiency and lower energy costs. The minimum acceptable TPF may be\nset by the building code or in relation to any high-performance housing program that the owner or\nbuilder plans to enroll the home with. For example, ENERGY STAR® for new homes standard\nidentifies that a water heater be of the condensing type and that the heater has undergone testing\naccording to the procedures outlined in CAN/CSA P.9 in order to meet their requirements.\nTypes of combination systems\nCombination systems perform two functions:\n• space heating; and\n• domestic water heating.\nSystem components\nTo understand the different types of combination systems and their operation, the gas technician/\nfitter must have a working knowledge of their components. The components of combination\nsystems are grouped into four main categories:\n• heat sources;\n• space heating units;\n• circulating equipment; and\n• control devices.\nSystems and water heaters should be identified and certified as suitable for combination heating\nsystems.\nPrinciples of operation\nIn a typical combination system, hot water is drawn from a gas-fired storage-type water heater\nand circulated through a water-to-air heat exchanger (fan-coil). The heat exchanger in some\nsystems is called a fan coil unit. A fan forces the wa",

Important design considerations include accurate calculation of space\nheating heat loss requirements and proper sizing of water heaters and pumps.\nObjectives\nAt the end of this chapter, you will be able to:\n• determine the size of water heater required for an application;\n• determine space heating requirements; and\n• describe pump sizing requirements.\nTerminology\nTerm Abbreviation Definition\n(Symbol)\nFeet of head water column ft. hd. w.c.\nFlow rate The amount of water to be circulated through\nthe system, traditionally measured in US gallons\nper minute\nGallon per minute gpm\nWater heater sizing\nThe following sizing information is only a basic guide to water heater sizing for combination\npotable water heating and space heating applications.\nBe aware that each building's domestic hot water requirements vary. Proper water heater sizing\nmust consider two factors:\n• the capacity of the water heater in gallons; and\n• the Btu input of the water heater.\n66 September 2020\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 18 Water heaters and combination systems\nDetermining water heater capacity\nThe following water heater sizing criteria are taken from a manufacturer's installation guide. The\nuse of a minimum 40 imperial gallon/48 USG (180 L), high-recovery and/or high-efficiency gasfired\nwater heater is recommended.\nTable 3-1 indicates air handler and water heater combinations that are adequate for installations\nin most areas of the country:\nTable 3-1\nDetermining water heater capacity for combination systems with fan coils\nAir handler Minimum water heater capacity\n600 cfm (280 Us) to 800 cfm (380 Us) 40 imp. gallon/48 USG (180 L)\n1000 cfm (470 Us) to 1200 cfm (570 Us) 50 imp. gallon/60 USG (225 L)\n1400 cfm (660 Us) to 1600 cfm (755 Us) Two 40 imp. gallon (180 L), twinned , or\nOne high-input 50 imp. gallon (225 L), or\nOne 72 (327 L) to 75 imp. gallon/90 USG\n(341 L)\n2000 cfm (940 Us) Any combination of water heaters having at\nleast 105 000 Btu/h (30 .8 kW) output\nDetermining water heater input\nThe required water heater input calculation is based on the:\n• calculated heat loss of the building in which the system is to be installed; and\n• water heater recovery efficiency rating.\nPerform the heat loss calculation in accordance with approved industry engineering practices.\nThe importance of this step cannot be understated.\nLocal climate and temperature variations have an effect on building heat loss and will therefore\nalso influence input calculations.\nFor example, a water heater installed in an area that has long, cold winters would require more\nenergy to produce a given amount of heat than one installed in a milder climate. For this reason,\na multiplication factor reflecting local climatic conditions must be factored into the calculation .\nAlways consult local information sources to ensure that your calculations include the proper\nclimate multiplication factors. The two examples shown below are for reference only.\n• For mild climates, Input= calculated heat loss x 1.51\n• For colder climates, Input= calculated heat loss x 1.58\nSeptember 2020 67\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 18 Water heaters and combination systems\nSpace heating requirements\nThe minimum capacity of an appliance or the portion of its total capacity used for space heating\nmust be based on the calculated heat loss of the building. Where an air handler is used as the\nonly source of heat, it should be sized accordingly. The design and installation of the system must\nbe in accordance with approved industry engineering practices or manuals published by one of\nthe following organizations or an equivalent:\n• Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Institute of Canada (HRAI);\n• American Society of Heating Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASH RAE); or\n• Air Conditioning Contractors of America (ACCA).\nAir handler\nSelect an air handler with a heating output that:\n• exceeds the calculated space heating loss of the building; and\n• has a cooling coil sized to match the outdoor condensing unit.\nThe heating output of the air handler or hot water coil will be less than the output of the hot water\nheater. Therefore, if the water heater is undersized, the heating capacity of the air handler will be\nless than its rated output.\nDomestic hot water heating\nThe minimum capacity of an appliance, or the portion of its total capacity used for supplying\ndomestic hot water, must be based on approved industry engineering practices or publication\nfrom one of the following organizations or an equivalent:\n• ASHRAE;\n• HRAI; or\n• American Society of Plumbing Engineers (ASPE).\nCombination space and domestic hot \"\\Vater heating\nThe capacities of combination hot water tank (HWT) and fan coil heating units can be calculated\nin accordance with the Combo System HWT/Fan Coil Sizing design worksheet (Figure 3-1 ). The\ndesign and installation of the system must be according to approved industry engineering\npractices. The design worksheet (Figure 3-1) provides a convenient way to size.\nThe designer may use the basic drawings provided in approved publications to show the basic\nprinciples of the proposed combination system. Other accessories or components may be\nrequired in accordance with local codes.\nCSA B149.1 has two stipulations with regards to the location and operation of a water heater\nused as a combo heating system:\n7.27.6\nExcept for direct-vent water heaters, when the water heater is used in a combo heating system,\nreturn-air inlets shall not be installed in the same enclosure that contains both an air-handling\nunit and the water heater.

Servicing systems\nOverview\nPurpose\nAn important part of a gas technician's/fitter's duties is to solve safely, accurately, and efficiently\nthe technical problems associated with hot water heating and combination systems. The gas\ntechnician/fitter must know how to troubleshoot and service electrical and non-electrical systems\nand components and analyze and correct problems that result from water conditions and\nimproper combustion.\nObjectives\nAt the end of this chapter, you will be able to:\n• service hot water heater and combination system electrical components;\n• troubleshoot and correct water heater and combination system non-electrical problems; and\n• analyze water heater and combination system malfunctions that result from water conditions\nand combustion problems.\nTer1ninology\nTerm Abbreviation Definition\n(Symbol)\nTemperature and pressure T&P relieve Valve that automatically opens a relief vent\nrelief valve valve when either the pressure or temperature\nreaches a predetermined value and reseats\nagain when the pressure or temperature returns\nto normal\nElectrical components\nThe fact that there is no hot water could indicate an electrical problem with the heater.\nIf the water heater comes with a standing pilot, check if the pilot burner is out. If yes, it could be\ndue to a number of electrical problems, including:\n• loose thermocouple connection to the control unit;\n• defective thermocouple; and\n• defective pilot magnet (pilotstat coil).\n76 September 2020\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 18 Water heaters and combination systems\nTesting for a loose thermocouple connection\nIf the thermocouple connection to the control unit is loose, then tighten it a 1 /4 turn past hand\ntight. You can also remove the thermocouple and check the terminal to make sure it is not broken\nor cracked . Ensure the threads are in good order.\nTesting for a defective thermocouple\nTo test for a defective thermocouple, use a millivolt-meter or a multi-meter.\nThe two tests for a fau lty thermocouple are:\n• open-circuit test; and\n• closed-circuit test.\nOpen-circuit test\nAn open-circuit test shows the potential millivolts that a thermocouple can produce when it is not\nunder load. Perform the test as follows:\n1) Disconnect the thermocouple from the pilotstat.\n2) Select a scale on the millivolt-meter suitable for reading a maximum of 30 mV.\n3) Connect one lead of the meter to the outer copper conductor of the thermocouple and the\nother lead to the end of the inner conductor, as shown in Figure 4-1 . With a pilot flame\nheating the hot junction of the thermocouple, the meter should read approximately 30 mV.\n4) If the meter reading is less than 20 mV, the thermocouple needs replacement.\nFigure 4-1\nTesting thermocouple open-circuit\nHot junction\nClosed-circuit test\nCold junction\nOuter copper\nconductor\n\"'-Meter\nA closed-circuit test shows the millivolts that can be maintained when the thermocouple is\npowering the magnetic coil of a pilotstat device.\nSeptember 2020 77\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 18 Water heaters and combination systems\nD\nFigure 4-2\nTesting thermocouple closed-circuit\nThermocouple\nr:::=J\nPilotstat\n- Closed ci1cuit\ntest adaptor\nThis test is performed with the thermocouple connected to the coil in a pilotstat device. This aim\nto evaluate the performance of the thermocouple and show the millivolt level that can be\nmaintained under load. Conduct this test, which is also used to check the condition of the pilotstat\ncoil, as follows:\n1) Disconnect the thermocouple from the pilotstat and install the test block as shown in Figure\n4-2.\n2) Reconnect the thermocouple to the top of the test block and relight the pilot burner.\n3) Connect one test lead to the outer conductor of the thermocouple and the other test lead to\nthe side terminal of the test adapter. Since the side terminal of the test adapter is internally\nconnected to the inner conductor of the thermocouple, you can perform a voltage while the\ncircuit is energized.\n4) The meter should read about 15 mV.\n5) If the meter reads less than 8 mV, the thermocouple needs to be replaced.\n78 September 2020\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 18 Water heaters and combination systems\nTesting for a defective pilotstat coil ( drop-out test)\nThe third electrical problem could be with the pilotstat coil.\nA small current is required in the coil to develop the magnetic field needed to hold the pilotstat\nvalve open. Because the current is so small, it is easier to test the voltage through the coil. Place\nthe test adapter as shown in Figure 4-2, and perform the test as follows:\n1) Connect one lead of the millivoltmeter to the copper conductor and the other to the terminal\non the side of the test adapter. The normal reading should be between 10 and 15 mV.\n2) Blow out the pilot flame and allow the thermocouple to cool. As the thermocouple cools,\nobserve that the reading on the millivoltmeter slowly decreases.\n3) The coil of the pilotstat should create enough magnetic field to hold the valve open until the\nmillivoltage drops to between 5 and 2 mV.\nIf ... Then .. .\nThe coil drops out with a reading greater It needs replacement.\nthan 5 mV\nThe coil holds the valve open with a The valve is sticking and should be replaced .\nreading less than 2 mV\nThis dropout of the coil must take place within\n90 seconds of the flame going out.\nTesting resistances and the use of the thermopile\nIncreases in resistance that reduce the current to a point where the gas valve coils do not operate\ncause many problems in millivolt control systems. The following cause these increases:\n• loose wiring connections;\n• corrosion to terminals and connectors;\n• poor wire splices; and\n• excessive wi re lengths.\nThe easiest way to identify where increases in resistance have developed is to measure the\nmillivolt drop across each component in the electrical circuit. Excessive millivolt drop indicates\nexcessive resistances.\nEnergy cut-off and thermal cut-off device\nAn energy cut-off (ECO) device is a safety feature added to many thermostatic gas controls. The\nECO is a fusible link wired in series between the thermocouple and the safety shut-off valve\ninside the control valve (Figure 4-3). It monitors the temperature of the water in the tank.\nThe fuse is either located alongside the invar rod inside the copper tube or is independent of the\ntemperature control probe. If the temperature of the water exceeds the preset limit (usually 200°F\nor 94 °C), the fuse melts and the circuit is broken between the thermocouple and the safety\nshutoff valve, and the gas flow to the burner is terminated.\nAn ECO is a single-use fuse. Once the device is activated, the gas valve must be replaced. If the\npilot burner does not remain lit when the reset button is released, check for continuity through the\nSeptember 2020 79\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 18 Water heaters and combination systems\nECO wires; the ECO may have been activated - the electrical circuit between the thermocouple\nand the safety shut-off valve is broken.\nFigure 4-3\nRod and tube gas control with energy cut-off fuse (ECO)\nCourtesy of Camosun College, Rodney Lidstone, licensed under CC BY\nA thermal cut-off device acts as limit switch. It monitors the temperature of the combustion\nchamber. For example, in FVIR systems when the flame arrestor becomes clogged with lint, dust,\nor oil, a temperature sensor will shut down the unit. The thermal limit or thermal cut-off (TCO)\nperforms two primary functions:\n1) In the event of flammable vapour ignition inside the combustion chamber, it senses the\ncorresponding increase in temperature and shuts off gas flow to the main and pilot burners.\n2) If excessive temperatures inside the combustion chamber indicate poor combustion because\nof a clogged screen or filter or inadequate air for combustion, the TCO will shut off gas flow\nto the main and pilot burners.\nThe TCO can be mounted just inside the outer door, or it can be part of the pilot assembly.\nIf the water heater is equipped with a rod-and-tube type thermostatic gas control the TCO is\nusually wired in series with the ECO and safety shut-off valve (Figure 4-4 ).\n80 September 2020\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 18 Water heaters and combination systems\nFigure 4-4\nRod and tube gas control wired in series\nlnvar rod\nCopper\ntemperature\nprobe\nReset button\nProtective ------.,.r-f=--_;~_t,,_-~~;=-=-=-,!;=....J=+====+==(.......::::::.....Jl..,\nplastic\nsleeve\nEnergy cut-off (ECO)\nThermal sensor\nGas inlet\nThermocouple\nThermal cut-off\nswitch (TCO)\nManual reset\nIf the water heater utilizes an electronic ignition system, the thermal switch will be connected\ndirectly to the control board.\nAlways ensure the temperature rating of the switch matches the manufactures system\nrequirements.\nFollow these steps to test the TCO when it is not part of the pilot assembly:\n1) Remove the outer jacket door.\n2) Disconnect the wire leads from the thermal switch.\n3) If the TCO has a manual reset, ensure that the button is pushed in.\n4) Using a multimeter capable of measuring resistance or an ohmmeter, pl_ace one probe of the\nmeter on each of the wire connection tabs. There should be no resistance through the\nswitch.\nIf the water heater is equipped with a TCO that is integral with the thermocouple, the temperature\ncutoff point will range depending on the make and model. This style of TCO is typically an\nautomatic reset thermal switch. When activated it will open the thermocouple circuit and shut off\nthe main and pilot burner gas flow. Light the pilot after the TCO has had sufficient time to cool\ndown. There is no routine service associated with the TCO. The standard thermocouple millivolt\noutput checks described in this section would apply. An adequate millivolt reading would indicate\nthat the TCO is closed . An open TCO (within a cool combustion chamber) would indicate that the\nassembly must be replaced.\nIf the TCO is an integral part of the thermocouple it will not be replaceable as a separate item. A\nnew pilot burner assembly must be installed. On repeated calls of no hot water or pilot outage",

Read and understand the most updated edition and printing with erratum of the National Plumbing Code of Canada for all requirements. \nBelow is an abridgement of two sections for hot water tank installations.\nChapter 1-Water Heaters\nChapter 1-Water Heaters\nChapter 1-Water Heaters\nUse Installation Instructions and Trade Manuals \nAdditional requirements and recommendations for gas-fired water heater installations can be found in manufacturer's instructions, manuals and service bulletins. \nManufacturer's Recommendations \nCompliance with manufacturer's recommendations and instructions is a code requirement and is necessary for safe and efficient water heater installation and servicing.\nChapter 1-Water Heaters\nThe manufacturer's documentation typically includes information on the following topics: \n•\tSafety requirements and precautions\n•\tInstaller and owner responsibilities\n•\tLocation requirements\n•\tWater piping installation instructions\n•\tGas piping and venting installation instructions\n•\tWater heater start-up instructions\n•\tOperating and troubleshooting instructions\nStartup procedures and startup reports are also found in manufacturers certified instructions and must be completed in many cases for full warranty coverage.\nChapter 1-Water Heaters\nTypes of Water Heaters \nWater Heaters \nWater heaters form the largest class of gas appliances. Their popularity is due to low initial cost, low operating cost, cleanliness and convenience. Water heaters range in size from very small recreational vehicle units, to domestic sizes for residential use, to larger installations for commercial buildings and manufacturing processes.\nChapter 1-Water Heaters\nDirect-fired Heaters \nThe most common type of water heater used for residential service and low-demand commercial applications is the direct-fired storage heater. In the context of a water heater, the term direct-fired means that the heat from the gas flame is in direct contact with a tank or pipe containing the water to be heated (Figure 1-1).\nChapter 1-Water Heaters\nFigure 1-1 Direct-fired, \nresidential storage-type \nwater heater\nChapter 1-Water Heaters\nIndirect Heaters \nIn an indirect water heating system, the water is not heated directly by the heat from the gas flame. The water is heated by a fluid that has been heated. \nAn indirect system typically consists of a hot-water storage tank",
