          "content": "Chapter 1 - Properties, characteristics, and safe handling of fuel gases\n\nComposition of LP-gases\nBoth propane and butane are extracted from petroleum oil and natural gas. After their separation into a liquefied state from wet gas, fractionation (chemical separation) into their final processed forms occurs. Processed propane is normally 100% pure; butane, when processed, is 93% pure with 7% added propane. Under normal atmospheric temperature and pressure, propane and butane are gases. At cooler temperatures and at higher pressures, both change easily into liquid form.\n\nProperties and characteristics of natural gas and propane\nSeveral physical properties are common to both natural gas and propane. It is important for a gas technician/fitter to thoroughly understand these to effectively work on fuel delivery and utilization.\n\nCommon properties\nBoth natural gas and propane are nontoxic, tasteless, colourless, invisible, and odourless.\n\nAs these gases are odourless (and not detectable by the nose), for safety, the odorant mercaptan is added. The chemical formula of ethyl mercaptan, typically added to natural gas, is C2H6S. Mercaptan helps to alert the user to a gas escape — and the consequent danger of a possible explosion or fire. In order to detect a gas leak below the gas's lower flammable limit, approximately 1 lb of mercaptan is added to every one million cubic feet of gas.\n\nOther properties\nA gas technician/fitter should be familiar with the physical properties of fuel gases such as specific gravity, expansion factors, boiling point, temperature and pressure relationships, and calorific value/heat content.\n\nSpecific gravity\nSpecific gravity (or relative density) refers to the comparison between the weight of a volume of a vapour or liquid and the weight of an equal volume of air or water. It is important to know the specific gravity of gases so you can effectively check for gas leaks, calculate flow rates through gas piping systems, and size orifices.\n\nSpecific gravity of vapour gases and air\nWhen comparing the specific gravity of gas and air, ensure that both are at the same pressure and temperature.\n\nAir has a specific gravity of 1.0. With a specific gravity of 0.60, natural gas is lighter than air, so it generally rises to the ceiling. Both propane and butane are heavier than air so they, in contrast, are likely to settle in low areas.\n\nSpecific gravity is an important consideration when trying to find the source of a gas leak or working where a leak has occurred.\n\nVapour fuel gases (and air):\n- Natural gas (CH4): 0.60\n- Air: 1.0\n- Propane (C3H8): 1.52 or 1.53\n- Butane (C4H10): 1.92 or 2\n\nLiquid specific gravity of LP-gases and water\nThe liquid specific gravity of LP-gas is normally compared to water, which has a specific gravity of 1.0.\n\nLP-gases (and water):\n- Propane (C3H8): 0.509 or 0.51\n- Butane (C4H10): 0.58\n- Water: 1.0\n\nExpansion factors\nWhen the temperature of a liquid increases, the liquid expands, which results in an increase in its volume. This is expressed in Boyle's law (p1V1 = p2V2).\n\nAllowing an expansion space between the liquid and the top of the container means filling LP-gas containers to a maximum of 80%.\n\nExpansion ratio of liquid to gas at standard atmospheric pressure:\n- Natural gas: 1:600\n- Propane: 1:270\n\nBoiling point\nAt standard atmospheric pressure:\n- Natural gas has a boiling temperature of −260 °F (−162.2 °C)\n- Propane has a boiling temperature of −44 °F (−42.2 °C)\n\nTemperature and pressure relationships\nVapour pressure is directly related to the temperature of the liquid in an enclosed container. As the temperature of an LP-gas increases, so does the pressure in the storage tank.\n\nThe liquefication of natural gas is only possible at very low temperatures, very high pressures, or a combination of these.\n\nCalorific value\nThe calorific value (or heat content) of a fuel usually refers to the energy released during the combustion of a given volume of fuel. Units of measurement are British thermal units per cubic foot (Btu/ft3) or megajoules per cubic meter (MJ/m3).\n\nGas calorific values:\n- Natural gas: 1000 Btu/ft3 (37 240 kJ/m3) or 0.293 kWh\n- Propane: 2520 Btu/ft3 (93 800 kJ/m3) or 0.738 kWh\n\nProperties summary table (approximate values):\nNatural Gas vs Propane:\n- Formula: CH4 vs C3H8\n- Toxicity: Non-toxic (both)\n- Physical properties: Colourless, tasteless, odourless (both)\n- Odorant: Mercaptan (both)\n- Specific gravity (vapour): 0.60 vs 1.52\n- Liquid specific gravity: — vs 0.51\n- Vapour expansion: 600 ft3 vs 270 ft3\n- Boiling point: −260 °F vs −44 °F\n- Calorific value: 1000 Btu/ft3 vs 2520 Btu/ft3\n\nCombustion data\n\nLimits of flammability\nLimits of flammability are the upper and lower ranges (LEL to UEL) of gas in the air-gas mixture that can support combustion. Too low an amount of fuel makes the mixture too \"lean\"; too high makes it too \"rich.\"\n\nIgnition temperature\nIgnition temperature is the temperature at which an air-gas mixture can initiate and support combustion.\n\nFlame temperature\nEach fuel gas has its own maximum flame temperature, reached at \"perfect combustion.\"\n\nFlame speed\nFlame speed is the speed at which a flame front moves towards an air-gas mixture that issues from a burner port.\n\nCombustion data (approximate values):\n- Limits of flammability: Natural gas 4 to 15%, Propane 2.4 to 9.5%\n- Ignition temperature: Natural gas 1300 °F (700 °C), Propane 920 °F (495 °C)\n- Maximum flame temperature: 3600 °F (1980 °C) for both\n- Flame speed: Natural gas 12 in/s (305 mm/s), Propane 11 in/s (280 mm/s)",

          "content": "Chapter 2 - Combustion\n\nThe combustion process\nCombustion is the rapid oxidation of fuel that results in the production of heat. For combustion to occur, three elements must be present: fuel, oxygen, and ignition.\n\nPerfect combustion\nPerfect combustion occurs when fuel and oxygen combine in exact proportions with complete oxidation of the fuel. The products are carbon dioxide (CO2), water vapour (H2O), and heat.\n\nChemical equation for perfect combustion of natural gas:\nCH4 + 2O2 + 8N2 → CO2 + 2H2O + 8N2 + heat\n\nComplete combustion\nIn practice, perfect combustion is rarely achieved. Complete combustion requires excess air to ensure all fuel is oxidized. The relationship is:\n\n1000 Btu of fuel input × 10 ft3 air = perfect combustion\nAdditional excess air (typically 50% for atmospheric burners) = complete combustion\n\nIncomplete combustion\nIncomplete combustion produces toxic products including carbon monoxide (CO) and aldehydes. This occurs when insufficient air is supplied or other conditions prevent complete oxidation.\n\nAir supply categories\n\nPrimary air\nPrimary air is mixed with fuel gas before ignition. In atmospheric burners, primary air is drawn in by the venturi effect created by gas flow through the orifice.\n\nSecondary air\nSecondary air is supplied from around the flames after ignition has occurred.\n\nCombustion air\nCombustion air is the total air required for perfect combustion (primary + secondary).\n\nExcess air supply\nExcess air is supplied beyond the combustion air requirement to ensure complete combustion. For atmospheric burners, excess air equal to 50% of the combustion air is typical.\n\nRelationship: 1000 Btu of input requires 5 ft3 of excess air supply.\n\nDilution air supply\nDilution air enters the venting system to cool and control stack action (for appliances with draft control devices).\n\nRelationship: 1000 Btu of input requires 15 ft3 of dilution air supply.\n\nTotal air supply\nTotal air is the volume required for safe and efficient operation, including combustion, excess, and dilution air.\n\nRelationship: 1000 Btu of input requires 30 ft3 of total air supply.\n\nSummary of air requirements per 1000 Btu of input:\n- Combustion air: 10 ft3\n- Excess air: 5 ft3\n- Dilution air: 15 ft3\n- Total air: 30 ft3\n\nCalculating for high-altitude locations\nAtmospheric pressure at sea level is 14.73 psia. For every 2000 ft rise in elevation, atmospheric pressure reduces by approximately 1 psia.\n\nUsing Boyle's law (p1V1 = p2V2): As altitude increases, gas becomes less dense and flows more easily through an orifice, putting the input-to-oxygen ratio out of balance.\n\nCauses of incomplete combustion\n\nFlame temperature\nCombustion must maintain approximately 1300 °F (649 °C) for natural gas and 920 °F (495 °C) for propane. If flame temperature drops below these points, incomplete combustion and toxic products result.\n\nCracked heat exchanger\nA crack in the heat exchanger allows supply air to contact hot flue gases, causing excessive air movement that adversely affects the flame and causes incomplete combustion.\n\nBlocked venting (natural draft appliance)\nIf venting becomes blocked, flue gases cannot reach outdoors and will spill from the draft hood. Lack of combustion air leads to incomplete combustion and carbon monoxide.\n\nNegative air pressure\nExcessive air exhausted from a building leads to negative air pressure, which can affect combustion and lead to incomplete combustion and down drafting.\n\nCondensation of products of combustion\n\nFlue gas condensation\nCondensing appliances extract additional heat by condensing water vapour (from burning hydrogen content) to liquid water, recovering its latent heat. This can increase efficiency by 10 to 20% over non-condensing appliances.\n\nThe condensate produced is slightly acidic (3 to 5 pH). Suitable materials for wetted areas include aluminum alloys and stainless steel (high temp areas) or polypropylene and UPVC (low temp areas).\n\nA stable flame\nA stable flame does not waver, lift off the burner, or flash back into the mixing tube.\n\nQualities of a stable Bunsen flame\n\nInner cone\nThin blue cone on the tip of the burner where initial burning occurs, forming products like aldehydes, alcohols, CO, and hydrogen. The velocity of the unburned air-gas mixture forms the shape.\n\nOuter cone\nDarker blue surrounding the inner cone, where secondary air diffuses into the flame. With sufficient secondary air, products from the inner cone are completely burned here, yielding CO2 and water vapour.\n\nOuter mantle\nColourless mantle surrounding the outer cone. Almost no unburned gases remain. Only glows due to high temperature of combustion products.\n\nRequirements of a stable flame\nBalance between flame speed and flow velocity must be maintained by adjusting primary air supply or gas flow rates.\n\nPrimary air supply adjustments:\n\nIncrease in air: As primary air increases, flame sharpens and inner cone gets smaller. At 90% air/10% gas for natural gas (94% air/6% gas for propane), flame reaches maximum speed. Beyond this, flame lifts off burner port.\n\nDecrease in air: As primary air decreases, burning speed decreases. Flame gets longer and more luminous. Further reduction results in yellow tips and carbon formation.\n\nInsufficient air supply\nAs primary or secondary air decreases, CO2 percentage in flue gases increases. Theoretical maximum CO2 is 11.7% for natural gas and 13.9% for propane. When flue gas CO2 reaches 10%+ for natural gas (11.5%+ for propane), air supply becomes insufficient and CO may be produced.\n\nGas supply (port loading)\nPort loading is the amount of air-gas mixture passing through a port, expressed as Btu/h per in2 of port area.\n\nPort loading = Input rate (Btu/h or kW) / Port area (in2 or mm2)\n\nFor natural gas, port loading between 25,000 and 30,000 Btu/h per in2 provides a stable flame.",

          "content": "Chapter 3 - Investigating gas leaks and incomplete combustion\n\nCombustible gas indicators (CGI)\nCGIs are instruments used to detect and measure concentrations of combustible gases in air. They are calibrated to specific gases and use conversion charts to test for other gases.\n\nConversion charts\nEach CGI is calibrated to a specific gas at the manufacturer's plant. A CGI calibrated for one gas may or may not read other substances correctly.\n\nCommon gases tested with CGI include: acetone, halon, naphtha, alcohol, hydrogen sulphide, natural gas, ammonia, industrial solvents, propane, butane, jet fuel, refrigerant, carbon monoxide, lacquer thinners, gasoline, methane, and smoke.\n\nCGI accessories and calibration\nUse non-conducting probes when probing overhead for electrical safety. CGIs cannot operate when filled with liquid - use liquid traps when sampling enclosed vessels. Periodically check calibration using test kits.\n\nInvestigating gas leaks\n\nStep 1 — Prepare\na) Prepare the CGI (switch on and purge in clean air)\nb) Bring useful equipment: leak detection soap solution, pressure gauge/manometer, Class 1 safety flashlight, pipe wrench\n\nStep 2 — Knock, do not use doorbell\nDo not use doorbell as it can cause ignition if gas is present near the power source.\n\nStep 3 — Communicate\na) Identify yourself\nb) Inquire about the situation\nc) Inform occupants: Do not smoke, use appliances, operate electrical switches, or use phones/pagers/cell phones in building\n\nStep 4 — Take a reading\nFor natural gas (specific gravity 0.60 - lighter than air): Test in basement stairwell near top of door\nFor propane (specific gravity 1.52 - heavier than air): Begin testing at floor level\n\nStep 5 — Take action based on LEL reading\n\nWhen reading is ABOVE the LEL (explosive limit):\n- Immediately evacuate all occupants including yourself\n- Stay calm and positive when directing people\n- Do NOT cross-ventilate (dangerous when gas concentrations near explosive limits)\n- Shut off service riser as you exit if able\n- Do NOT return to building with tools\n- Call for help from safe distance (fire department, police, gas utility)\n- Keep everyone at safe distance from hazard area\n- Remember: Buildings are replaceable, lives are not\n\nWhen reading is WELL BELOW the LEL:\n- Remain calm\n- Operate exhaust fans, open windows and doors\n- Use forced air ventilation (portable cooling fan) to create cross-draft\n- For propane, place fan low on floor\n- Remember: fans do not have spark-proof motors, only use when gas is below LEL\n\nStep 6 — Cut off ignition sources (when below LEL)\n- Open master breaker at electrical panel\n- Close valves on lines supplying gas appliances\n\nStep 7 — Determine source of leak\nUse both nose and CGI to help determine leak source.\n\nFaint smell with strong reading: Likely outside, below-ground leak that has infiltrated building\n- Gas diffuses through soil, finding way into conduits, sewer lines, foundations\n- Odorant compounds (mercaptans) adhere to soil particles, so odour may be absent\n- Call gas utility supplier\n- Go outside and assess situation on street\n- Turn off propane cylinder/tank service valve if applicable\n\nStrong smell: Likely inside leak\n- Check all conduit entry points, gas service entry, below-grade wall cracks\n- Check floor drains, sump pump holes, ceiling atmosphere\n- Check piping, fittings, manifolds, low-lying areas\n- Take dial-gauge/manometer test reading\n- Do soap test\n- Shut off all appliances and listen for gas passing\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO) testing\n\nCO characteristics\nCO is colourless, odourless, toxic gas with specific gravity of 0.98 (collects in higher locations). Although odourless, aldehydes and sulphur dioxide (also from incomplete combustion) create pungent odour that may accompany CO.\n\nCO is product of incomplete combustion. It bonds with hemoglobin 200 times more easily than oxygen, forming carboxyhemoglobin. Death occurs rapidly at high concentrations. Chronic exposure to low levels compounds preexisting health conditions with flu-like symptoms.\n\nCO concentrations and health consequences:\n- 200 ppm for 2-3 h: Slight headache, fatigue, dizziness, nausea\n- 400 ppm for 1-2 h: Frontal headache; 3 h+ life-threatening\n- 800 ppm for 45 min: Dizziness, nausea, convulsions; 2 h unconscious; 2-3 h death\n- 1600 ppm for 20 min: Headache, dizziness, nausea; 60 min death\n- 3200 ppm for 5-10 min: Headache, dizziness, nausea; 30 min death\n- 6400 ppm for 1-2 min: Headache, dizziness, nausea; 10-15 min death\n- 12,800 ppm for 1-3 min: Death\n\nCarbon monoxide testers\n\nPump-type CO testers:\n- Tube-type (Draeger, Gastec): Single-use tube with dry chemical that discolors\n- Liquid-type: Partially filled with liquid that absorbs CO and expands\n- Continuous sampling: Takes continuous sample with dial indicator or printout\n\nElectronic CO testers:\n- Portable handheld solid-state instruments (e.g., Bacharach Monoxor III)\n- Continuous readout digital displays\n- Measure 0 to 2000 ppm CO\n- Sensor probe inserted into flue or airspace\n\nInvestigating incomplete combustion\n\nStep 1 — Check products of combustion\nCheck (air-free basis) products of combustion on all vented appliances. If vented appliance produces more than 400 ppm CO (air-free) and cannot be adjusted, disconnect and red-tag. Under normal operation, appliance should produce less than 50 ppm CO air-free.\n\nIf products of combustion test normal, check house atmosphere for CO. If indoor CO exceeds 35 ppm, ventilate building and shut off appliances.\n\nStep 2 — Check appliance venting system\nCheck venting is working properly with appliances off and on. If chimney/vent is reversing or down drafting, determine cause: active fireplace, exhaust fans, combustion/ventilation air adequacy, chimney height, termination location, rain cap on Type B vent.\n\nStep 3 — Check other fuel-burning appliances\nCheck for other fuel-burning appliances (ovens, ranges, fireplaces, water heaters, wood stoves, oil-fired appliances). Check venting system sizing is appropriate for number and type of appliances. Check condition and clean debris from chimney cleanout.\n\nStep 4 — Check furnace heat exchanger\nCheck for cracks. If found, inform customer heat exchanger needs replacement or new furnace. Check for secondary heat exchanger and verify it's acceptable type in good condition.\n\nStep 5 — Check appliance input\nClock gas meter to determine input for each vented residential appliance. Perform operational check of industrial/commercial equipment. Check for other odour causes (paint/solvent fumes, kerosene heaters, auto engines).\n\nEffects of corrosive vapours\n\nCorrosive substances\nMost common corrosive element is chlorinated hydrocarbons (solvents, cleaners, refrigerants). When heated, molecules break down to form corrosive substances.\n\nBe suspicious of: degreasing materials, jewellery cleaners, electronic component cleaners, glues (except water-based), grease/wax/ink removers, aerosol spray propellants, freon-type refrigerants, paint/varnish strippers, dry-cleaning solvents, swimming pool chlorine, cat litter, bleaches.\n\nIf chemical name contains \"chlor\" or \"fluor\", likely problematic. Known substances: chlordane, refrigerants, methylene chloride, perchloride, trichlorophenol, trichlorfon.\n\nChemistry of corrosion\nSimplified equation: CH2Cl2 + O2 = CO2 + 2HCl\n(methylene chloride + oxygen = carbon dioxide + hydrogen chloride)\n\nHydrogen chloride is very soluble in water. With slightest trace of water, forms hydrochloric acid which attacks appliances and heating system components.\n\nAt beginning and end of each burner cycle, heat exchanger is cool and water in combustion products condenses. Hydrogen chloride dissolves to form hydrochloric acid, which is extremely corrosive.\n\nSpotting corrosion\nLooks like ordinary rust with fine red powder or large rusty scales/flakes. Additional characteristic: whitish powdery streaks running downward and drying on galvanized steel vents. Inner surfaces show white powder. In fresh corrosion, streaks may be wet and appear oily.\n\nCorrective measures\nDo not install appliance in room with corrosive vapours atmosphere. When corrosion discovered, take corrective measures before replacing equipment.\n\nHelpful measures:\n1) Store, transfer, use solvent in closed, fan-ventilated room with no gas-fired equipment\n2) Remove partially used containers of solvent\n3) Consider direct vent/roof-mounted heaters (all combustion air from outdoors), or hot water/steam heating with boiler/water heater in enclosed area away from solvent",
