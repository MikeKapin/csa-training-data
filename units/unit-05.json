          "content": "Chapter 1 - Lock-out and tagging procedures for electrical equipment\n\nGeneral lock-out and tagging procedures\nAs a gas technician/fitter, you may often be in areas where employees carry out maintenance procedures on powered machinery. At these times, detailed lock-out procedures are essential to prevent the unexpected operation and energizing of the machinery you are working on.\n\n\"Lock-out\" must involve more than merely disconnecting the power source (workers have been killed by electrically de-energized machinery that has had its hydraulic systems still pressurized). You must thoroughly assess the machine and make all energy sources inoperative (including electrical, pneumatic, hydraulic, and gravitational). This is what is often called the \"zero mechanical state\".\n\nAs a technician/fitter, you should have your own lock and key (combination locks are not allowed) and only use these locks to lock out energy sources. Inform the machine operator of any maintenance plans and tag the lock to identify the individual who has locked out the machinery.\n\nNote: The only person permitted to remove a lock is the person who placed the lock on the machinery.\n\nThese procedures apply both to stationary industrial equipment and mobile equipment (including passenger cars, truck equipment, and heavy construction equipment).\n\nLock-out requirements in CSA C22.1\n\nRule 2-304: Disconnection\n1) No repairs or alterations shall be carried out on any live equipment except where complete disconnection of the equipment is not feasible.\n2) Three-way or four-way switches shall not be considered as disconnecting means.\n3) Adequate precautions, such as locks on circuit breakers or switches, warning notices, sentries, or other equally effective means, shall be taken to prevent electrical equipment from being electrically charged when work is being done.\n\nLock-out requirements: Refer to CSA Z460 and CSA Z462.\n\nHazardous energy control devices and locks\nThe control of hazardous energy associated with potentially harmful machines, equipment, or processes requires the safety team and individuals to follow strict guidelines. CSA Z460 and CSA Z462 are recognized standards for the protection of personnel from injury from the inadvertent release of hazardous energy.\n\n\"Release of hazardous energy\" includes any motion, energization, start-up, or release of stored energy that, from the perspective of the person(s) at risk, is either unintended or deliberate. \"Lock-out\" is recognized to be the primary method to control hazardous energy.\n\nWorkers must consult the employer's policies and procedures before conducting any work on equipment or systems with hazardous energy. Training and supervision are a requirement. You must always gain authorization from your employer or supervisor before attempting any work.\n\nResponsibility of workers\nEach worker who works on machinery or equipment requiring lock-out procedures is responsible for:\n• Locking the control devices; and\n• Removing their own lock(s) on completion of work.\n\nChecking locked-out machinery\nThe person who applies the first lock in a lock-out procedure must ensure that it is impossible for the locked-out machinery or equipment to operate.\n\nRemoval of locks\nOnly the following people can remove locks:\n• The person(s) who installed them; or\n• In an emergency, the senior shift supervisor on duty (who must first make every effort to contact the individual who installed the lock) and subsequently ensure safe operation of the machinery or equipment.\n\nEnsure that during shift changes, workers coming on shift place their own locks on all control devices before the individuals going off shift remove their locks.\n\nKey box system\nThe use of a key box system is acceptable when multiple lock-outs are involved:\na) Two qualified workers (one of whom may be a supervisor) must be responsible for locking out the multiple control devices, completing/signing/posting the checklist adjacent to the key box, and placing keys for the locks in the key box.\nb) All other workers who must work on the machinery or equipment must also lock out the key box using personal locks before commencing maintenance or repair work.\nc) On completion of work, all workers must remove their locks from the key box.\nd) The two qualified workers who locked out the equipment must then remove their locks from the key box and from the multiple lock-out points.\ne) A written key box lock-out procedure must remain posted at the key box location.\n\nException for central control system\nWhen a central control operator manages systems, they shall lock out the central control and record the locked out portion and the time. They shall re-energize the system only on the instructions of the person who requested the de-energization, after that person has determined that it is safe to do so.\n\nMotor disconnects\nWhen motor disconnect switches are installed for lock-out purposes, the relevant person must simultaneously disconnect both the motor and motor control circuits from their power sources. These switches must be readily accessible, and if installed in elevated positions, access must be by means of a permanent ladder or stairway to a platform.\n\nWorking on de-energized equipment\nBefore work commences on any part of an electrical power system that, for reasons of safety, must operate in a de-energized condition, the worker in charge shall ensure the completion of the de-energizing and grounding (of the part of the system they are working on) and the lock-out of the controls.\n\nAssurance of de-energization\nWhen the control devices are not under the direct control of the worker, they must receive assurance from the person in charge of the control devices that the work may safely proceed. The person giving the assurance must record such an assurance.\n\nProtection against re-energizing\nBefore commencing work on a de-energized part of a system, the worker in charge must ensure the protection of all workers against re-energization.\n\nAuthority to re-energize\nThe re-energization of a system must not take place except on the instructions of the worker who requested the de-energizing, or of a supervisor who has first determined that it is safe to do so.\n\nRequirements of applicable electrical safety codes and standards\n\nElectrical codes and standards\nIt is necessary for a gas technician/fitter working on or around electrical equipment to understand the national, provincial, and municipal codes and standards relevant to electrical work. These codes and standards are the authority for rules governing the installation, maintenance, connection, and disconnection of electrical equipment.\n\nThey are also the source of:\n• Legal requirements affecting the connection and disconnection of electrical equipment\n• Requirements for notification of the inspecting authority\n• Requirements for necessary permits\n• Requirements for additions or renovations to existing equipment\n\nElectrical inspections and permits\nMost jurisdictions require permits for all electrical work. The locally recognized electrical code covers the general rules governing the administration of electrical permits (typically in Section 2, \"General Rules\").\n\nIt is the responsibility of the electrical contractor (or whomever is responsible for carrying out the work) to obtain a permit from the local electrical inspection department before commencing work on the installation, alteration, repair, or extension of any electrical equipment. A copy of the electrical permit must remain posted in a conspicuous place at the site of work, until the completion of the electrical inspection.\n\nCanadian Electrical Code requirements\nThe CE Code contains Sections and specific Rules that deal with the installation and maintenance of electrical equipment as it relates to gas-fired equipment.\n\nSection 12 — Wiring methods: Deals with wiring installation requirements.\n\nSection 14 — Protection and control: Covers the protection and control of electrical circuits and apparatuses, including circuit breakers and fuses.\n\nSection 26 — Installation of electrical equipment\n\nHeating equipment:\n\nRule 26-800: Scope - Rules 26-802 to 26-808 apply to circuits supplying power for the operation and control of non-portable heating equipment that uses solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel.\n\nRule 26-802: Mechanical protection of cables - Cables for all branch circuits or tap conductors within 1.5 m from the floor shall be adequately protected from mechanical damage.\n\nRule 26-804: Fuel burner safety controls - Fuel burner safety controls shall be installed in accordance with the requirements of CSA C22.2 No. 3.\n\nRule 26-806: Heating equipment rated 117 kW and less\n1) All electric power for the heating unit and associated equipment shall be obtained from a single branch circuit used for no other purpose.\n2) Circulating pumps and similar equipment need not be considered as associated equipment if not essential for safe operation.\n3) Subrule 1) does not apply to a water heater using a gaseous fuel.\n4) The branch circuit shall be permitted to be tapped as necessary, but there shall be no overcurrent protection in the tap to any essential equipment, unless the control equipment shuts down the heating unit if associated equipment fails.\n5) Suitable disconnecting means shall be provided.\n6) Disconnecting means shall be permitted to be a branch circuit breaker at the distribution panelboard, provided the panelboard is located between the furnace and the point of entry to the area.\n7) Where a separate switch is required, it shall not be located on the furnace nor reachable only by passing close to the furnace, and shall be marked to indicate the equipment it controls.\n\nRule 26-808: Heating equipment rated at more than 117 kW\n1) All electric power shall be obtained from a single feeder or branch circuit not used for other purposes.\n2) A suitable disconnecting means shall be provided.",

A static charge is the accumulated electric charge \nthat is present on an object.\nThe main danger from static electricity is arcing. Arcing is a \nlightning-like discharge of electricity across an insulating \nmedium or air space. The arc can ignite flammable gases or \nmaterials that it comes in contact with. A good example of \nthis phenomenon is the ignition of the fuel mixture by a \nspark plug in an automobile engine.\nElectric Shock\nWhen working with electrical equipment, you must be \nconstantly aware of the hazard of electric shock. You must \nknow what factors increase the danger of shock, how to \navoid shock, and what to do when dealing with a shock \nvictim.\nFactors affecting electric shock:\n•\nAmount and path of current\n•\nType of voltage (AC or DC)\n•\nValue of voltage\n•\nLength of time the body is energized\n•\nCondition of the skin\n•\nArea of contact\nCurrent Effects on Human Body\nRange (mA)\nEffect\n1 or less\nNo sensation\n1-8\nShock is felt but not painful. Victim can let go. Muscular control is kept.\n8-15\nShock is painful. Victim can let go. Muscular control is kept.\n15-20\nShock is painful. Victim cannot let go. Muscular control is lost. \nBreathing is difficult.\n20-50\nShock is very painful. Victim cannot let go. There are severe muscular \ncontractions.\n50-200\nSevere muscular contractions and nerve damage. Possible ventricular \nfibrillation of the heart, causing death.\nOver 200\nSevere burns and muscular contractions. Victim cannot breathe \nduring shock.\nNote: Currents in the lethal range do not always cause death if the victim is given immediate medical attention.\nVoltage and Current Dangers\nVoltage Risks\nIn practice, operating a flashlight is usually perfectly safe. \nThis is because the flashlight cell has a very low voltage that \ncannot overcome the resistance of human skin and current \nflow is limited.\nThe danger of shock increases as voltage increases, but low \nvoltages are not necessarily safe. Contact with 120 volts AC, \nthe common household voltage, has led to more deaths than \nwith any other voltage. Note that AC voltages above 750 \nvolts are high voltage.\nDC Voltage Dangers\nDC voltages can be very dangerous. Industrial voltages as \nsmall as 42 volts DC can be lethal.\nAlthough 75 volts can be just as lethal as 1000 volts, victims \nof high-voltage shock usually respond better to \nresuscitation. Provided that they receive the artificial \nrespiration immediately, their chance of survival is good. On \nthe other hand, victims of low-voltage shock do not respond \nwell to artificial respiration, because the low-voltage shock \ncauses uncoordinated twitching of the walls of the heart, \nwhich interferes with sudden restoration of normal pulses.\nHuman Body Resistance Factors\nMoisture and Salt\nWhen skin is wet or salty, its resistance drops \nto several hundred from several thousand \nohms. Therefore, weather can affect the \nhazard of shock. Wet, humid, or hot weather \ncauses perspiration, thus reducing \nresistance. On the other hand, cold, dry \nweather may increase skin resistance. \nVigorous exercise can also increase \nperspiration and reduce resistance.\nAbrasions\nBecause the insulating layers of skin are \nabsent, abrasions reduce body resistance to \nwell below 100 ohms.\nApplied Voltage and Duration\nSkin resistance changes according to the \napplied voltage. Resistance is lower at high \nvoltages. The longer the application of the \nvoltage to the skin, the lower the resistance.\nContact Points\nThe body has different resistance at different \ncontact points. Between the ears, body \nresistance is only 100 ohms. Measured from \nhand to foot, resistance is nearly 500 ohms.\nRescuing Shock Victims\nAct Fast\nThe most important thing is \nto ACT FAST. The resistance \nof the victim decreases with \ntime, and the victim can die \nin just a few seconds.\nProtect Yourself\nNever touch a victim who is \nstill connected to the electric \npower. If you do, you will also \nexperience shock.\nDisconnect Power\nFirst, try to disconnect the \nelectricity. If you cannot \nquickly find the switch or \nplug, try to pull the victim \nand live conductor(s) apart. \nUse a dry wooden pole or \nsome other dry insulating \nmaterial (such as wood, \nglass, paper, cloth, etc.). Do \nnot use your hands or a \nconducting material.\nBegin Resuscitation\nIf the victim is unconscious \nand has stopped breathing, \nstart artificial respiration at \nonce. DO NOT STOP until a \nmedical authority advises \nyou to stop.\nFive Steps to Rescue a Shock Victim\nProtect yourself\nDo not touch the energized victim\nFree the victim\nDisconnect from electrical contact\nApply CPR\nUse artificial respiration as necessary\nCall for help\nContact doctor, nurse, fire department, rescue unit, or police unit\nContinue resuscitation\nUntil a medical authority advises you to stop\nGrounding\nProper grounding of tools, equipment, and sources of static \ndischarge is essential for reducing the risk of electrical hazards.\nYou shall effectively ground portable tools and equipment that \nrequire grounding and are not permanently connected to the \nwiring system through the use of approved three-wire cords and \nthree-prong polarized plugs inserted in grounded polarized \nreceptacles.\nYou must install ground straps where necessary to prevent static \ndischarge.\nDouble-Insulated Tools\nMany modern portable tools may not have a three-pronged \nplug but instead are double-insulated and have a two-\npronged plug. A tool that is double-insulated provides \nequivalent shock hazard protection as a tool with a three-\npronged grounded plug.\nIf you use a power tool with a two-pronged plug, ensure that \nthe tool is double-insulated. To determine if the tool is \ndouble-insulated, the tool should have certification (e.g., by \nCSA) and marking with either the words \"DOUBLE \nINSULATED\" or the following symbol:\nFigure 1-1 Double insulated symbol\nElectrical Code Safety \nRequirements\nCode References\nElectrical safety codes contain sections and specific rules that deal with the \ninstallation and maintenance of electrical equipment as it relates to gas-fired \nequipment. Most provincial electrical codes are either based on or fully adopt the \nCanadian Electrical Code. However, some differences may exist, and you should \nalways make reference the code accepted locally or provincially.\nCanadian Electrical Code\nThe following provisions are part of the Canadian Electrical Code, Part I (C22.1-18).\nSection 2 - General Rules\nRule 2-032 Damage and interference\n1.\nNo person shall damage any electrical installation or \ncomponent thereof.\n2.

A static charge is the accumulated electric charge that is \npresent on an object. \nThe main danger from static electricity is arcing. Arcing is a lightning-like discharge of electricity \nacross an insulating medium or air space. The arc can ignite flammable gases or materials that it \ncomes in contact with. A good example of this phenomenon is the ignition of the fuel mixture by a \nspark plug in an automobile engine. \nElectric shock \nWhen working with electrical equipment, you must be constantly aware of the hazard of electric \nshock. You must know what factors increase the danger of shock, how to avoid shock, and what \nto do when dealing with a shock victim. \nFactors affecting electric shock \nWhen a person receives a shock, the electric current passes through the person, (usually to the \nearth or ground). The severity of the shock depends upon how much current passes through the \nbody. The factors that affect the severity of a shock are: \n• amount and path of current; \n• type of voltage (ac or de); \n• value of voltage; \n• length of time the body is energized; \n• condition of the skin; and \n• area of contact. \nCurrent \nAny current over 10 mA can produce painful shock. Depending on the voltage and other \nconditions, a current greater than 15 mA passing through the body can paralyze the victim and \nmake it impossible to let go of the energized wire. This is a very small current. An ordinary \nflashlight uses more than 30 times this current. Any current over 50 mA can kill the victim. \nMarch 2022 \n9\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 5 \nIntroduction to electricity \nTable 1-1 lists the physiological effects of various currents. \nTable 1-1 \nPhysiological effects of various currents \nRange \nmA \nEffect \nNon-lethal \n1 or less \nNo sensation \n1-8 \nShock is felt but not painful. Victim can let go. Muscular \ncontrol is kept. \n8-15 \nShock is painful. Victim can let go. Muscular control is kept. \n15-20 \nShock is painful. Victim cannot let go. Muscular control is \nlost. Breathing is difficult. \n20-50 \nShock is very painful. Victim cannot let go. There are severe \nmuscular contractions. \nLethal \n50-200 \nSevere muscular contractions and nerve damage. \nPossible ventricular fibrillation of the heart, causing death. \nOver200 \nSevere burns and muscular contractions. \nVictim cannot breathe during shock. \nNote: Currents in the lethal range do not always cause death if the victim is given immediate medical \nattention. \nIn practice, operating a flashlight is usually perfectly safe. This is because the flashlight cell has a \nvery low voltage that cannot overcome the resistance of human skin and current flow is limited. \nThe danger of shock increases as voltage increases, but low voltages are not necessarily safe. \nContact with 120 volts ac, the common household voltage, has led to more deaths than with any \nother voltage. Note that AC voltages above 750 volts are high voltage. \nDC voltages can be very dangerous. Industrial voltages as small as 42 volts de can be lethal. \nChapter 5. Theory of direct and alternating current discusses the differences between ac and de. \nAlthough 75 volts can be just as lethal as 1000 volts, victims of high-voltage shock usually \nrespond better to resuscitation. Provided that they receive the artificial respiration immediately, \ntheir chance of survival is good. On the other hand, victims of low-voltage shock do not respond \nwell to artificial respiration, because the low-voltage shock causes uncoordinated twitching of the \nwalls of the heart, which interferes with sudden restoration of normal pulses. \nn1 \nThe electrical resistance of the human body varies because of moisture, salt, and abrasions on \nthe skin. Resistance of the skin varies from 100 ohms to over 500 000 ohms. The applied \nvoltage, the duration of applied voltage, and the points of contact also affect skin resistance. \n10 \nMarch 2022\nIntroduction to electricity \nMoisture and salt \nWhen skin is wet or salty, its resistance drops to several hundred from several thousand ohms. \nTherefore, weather can affect the hazard of shock. Wet, humid, or hot weather causes \nperspiration, thus reducing resistance. On the other hand, cold, dry weather may increase skin \nresistance . Vigorous exercise can also increase perspiration and reduce resistance. \nAbrasions \nBecause the insulating layers of skin are absent, abrasions reduce body resistance to well below \n100 ohms. \nApplied voltage and its duration \nSkin resistance changes according to the applied voltage. Resistance is lower at high voltages. \nThe longer the application of the voltage to the skin, the lower the resistance. \nContact points \nThe body has different resistance at different contact points. Between the ears, body resistance \nis only 100 ohms. Measured from hand to foot, resistance is nearly 500 ohms. \nRescuing shock victims \nYou must always take general precautions in the case of electrical shock. \nThe most important thing is to ACT FAST. The resistance of the victim decreases with time, and \nthe victim can die in just a few seconds. \nNever touch a victim who is still connected to the electric power. If you do, you will also \nexperience shock. \nFirst, try to disconnect the electricity. If you cannot quickly find the switch or plug, try to pull the \nvictim and live conductor(s) apart. Use a dry wooden pole or some other dry insulating material \n(such as wood, glass, paper, cloth, etc.). Do not use your hands or a conducting material. \nIf the victim is unconscious and has stopped breathing, start artificial respiration at once. DO \nNOT STOP until a medical authority advises you to stop. \nSumtnary \nIn the absence of other instructions, follow these five simple steps to rescue a shock victim: \n1) \nProtect yourself-do not touch the energized victim. \n2) \nFree the victim from electrical contact. \n3) \nApply cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or artificial respiration, as necessary. \n4) \nHave someone call a doctor, nurse, fire department, rescue Unit, or police Unit. \n5) \nContinue resuscitation attempts until a medical authority advises you to stop. \nGrounding \nProper grounding of tools, equipment, and sources of static discharge is essential for reducing \nthe risk of electrical hazards. \nMarch 2022 \n11\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 5 \nIntroduction to electricity \nYou shall effectively ground portable tools and equipment that require grounding and are not \npermanently connected to the wiring system through the use of approved three-wire cords and \nthree-pr",

The smallest particle of \nmatter that can take part in a chemical reaction is an atom. Atoms are the submicroscopic \nbuilding blocks of matter. They combine to form larger particles called molecules. Atoms and \nmolecules are much too small to be seen or weighed directly. \nAtoms and molecules form various elements and compounds. An element is a substance made \nup of only one kind of atom. A compound contains more than one type of atom, chemically \ncombined. Water is an example of a compound . Each water molecule is made up of one oxygen \natom and two hydrogen atoms. To understand electricity, you must know something about the \nstructure of atoms. \nAtomic structure \nAtoms are made up of smaller particles, called subatomic particles: \n• neutrons; \n• protons; and \n• electrons. \nAlthough scientists have found further subdivisions of these particles, it is only necessary for our \nunderstanding of electricity to focus on protons and electrons. \nFigure 2-1 \nA carbon atom \nThe centre of the atom is the nucleus (plural nuclei), which houses protons and neutrons. \nElectrons revolve around the nucleus in orbits. See Figure 2-1, a diagram of a carbon atom. \nMarch 2022 \n27\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 5 \nIntroduction to electricity \nThe number of electrons, protons, and neutrons in the atoms of an element determines how that \nelement behaves. \nAtoms of different elements have different numbers of protons in their nuclei. This number is the \natomic number that identifies that element. For example, the nucleus of a carbon atom always \ncontains 6 protons, and you say that the atomic number of carbon is 6. The atomic number of \nhelium is 2, and the atomic number of copper is 29. \nSubatomic particles are extremely small. Electrons are about three times as large as protons, but \nthey are 1840 times lighter. They are easy to move. Neutrons have about the same mass as \nprotons. \nThe electron carries the basic Unit of electrical charge. For historical reasons, an electron's \ncharge is considered to be a negative(-) charge. Because it is free to move, an electron actively \nparticipates in the transfer of electrical energy. \nThe proton carries a positive(+) charge, opposite to that of an electron. It has the same size of \ncharge as the electron's negative one. Protons are not directly active in the flow of electrical \nenergy, but they do influence the flow of electrons. \nThe nucleus of an atom has an overall positive electrical charge due to the protons. The \nnegatively charged electrons revolve around the positive nucleus. See Figure 2-2. \nFigure 2-2 \nNegative electrons revolve in orbits around the positively charged nucleus \n28 \nMarch 2022\nAtoms and ions \nUnder normal circumstances, the atom has equal numbers of protons and electrons. These \ncharges cancel each other out, and the atom as a whole is electrically neutral. \nAn atom can receive a negative charge through the addition of electrons. It can receive a positive \ncharge through removal of electrons. When charging an atom occurs these ways, the atom \nbecomes ionized and is now an ion. For example, a positive ion is an atom that has had one or \nmore electrons removed. \nSince protons are firmly bound into the nucleus, only electrons can take part in ionizing the atom. \nCond11ctors and insulators \nSome materials, including copper and aluminum, have electrons that are easy to free. They are \nsaid to have many free electrons and are conductors. Conductors allow easy transfer of electrical \nenergy. \nSome other materials, such as glass and rubber, have electrons that are very difficult to free. \nThey are said to have few free electrons and are insulators. Insulators block the transfer of \nelectrical energy. \nElectrostatic charges and fields \nElectrostatic charges and fields are also known as static electricity. Static electricity is energy in \nthe form of a stationary electric charge such as th_at stored in thunderclouds or produced by \nfriction. For example, when you rub together certain pairs of materials (such as fur and a rubber \nrod), an electrostatic charge is produced. The friction produces heat energy that releases \nelectrons from the atoms on the surface of one of the materials. \nElectrical charges \nAn object may possess a positive electrical charge, a negative electrical charge, or it may be \nelectrically neutral. The type of charge that an object has depends on the number of electrons \nand protons it has. \nIf it has ... \nThen it... \nFewer electrons than protons \nHas a positive charge \nMore electrons than protons \nHas a negative charge \nThe same number of electrons and protons \nIs neutral \nLaw of electrical charges \nA fundamental law governs the way charged particles behave: \nLike charges repel and unlike charges attract. \nMarch 2022 \n29\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 5 \nIntroduction to electricity \nNegatively charged particles repel other negatively charged particles. They tend to move away \nfrom each other. Similarly, positively charged particles repel each other. However, negatively \ncharged particles attract positively charged particles. They tend to move toward each other. \nBecause of this law: \n• Protons ( +) and electrons (-) attract each other. \n• Protons repel other protons. \n• Electrons repel other electrons. \nElectrostatic forces and fields \nThe electrical charges on protons and electrons are electrostatic charges. An electrostatic charge \nhas an electrostatic field associated with it and, within this field, electrostatic forces occur. These \nforces are the forces of attraction and repulsion between charged particles. \nElectrical diagrams show the lines of force around a negative charge as straight lines with arrows \npointing toward the charge. See Figure 2-3a. \nFigure 2-3 \nLines of force around negative and positive charges \n-,,\\t~ \n...... -•·\\/ \n'---.ct-\n(a) Lines of force around a negative charge \n/1+V' \n(b) Lines of force around a positive charge \nDiagrams show the lines of force around a positive charge as radiating outward from the charge. \nSee Figure 2-3b. \nFigure 2-4 shows how the lines of force around positively and negatively charged objects cause \nforces of attraction and repulsion. \nThe strength of the forces of attraction and repulsion depends on: \n• the amount of charge on each object; and \n• the square of the distance between the objects. \nThe greater the electric charges on the objects, the greater the electrostatic force. \nAlso, the closer the charged objects are to each other, the greater the electrostatic force. \n30 \nMarch 2022\nFigure 2-4 \nLines of force in electrostatic fields of charged particles, showing the law of \nelectrical charges \nPositive charges repel each other \nNegative charges repel each other \nPositive and negative charges attract each other \nProduction and use of electricity \nDuring removal of electrons from their atoms (so that they are free to move), the moving \nelectrons may transfer electrical energy.

The part of the circuit that does the work \nis the load. The circuit provides a path for the flow of electric current. In a closed circuit, the path \nis complete and current can flow. In an open circuit, the path is incomplete and current cannot \nflow. Opening a circuit is possible through breakage, by disconnection from an energy source, or \nby a switch. \nA simple electrical circuit consists of the following components: \n• an energy source (such as a battery or a wall plug); \n• conductors (connecting wires); and \n• a load (a device that uses electrical energy to do work). \nA circuit often has a switch and an overcurrent protective device such as a fuse or circuit breaker. \nFigure 3-1 shows a simple circuit. \n40 \nFigure 3-1 \nAn electric circuit \nConnecting wires \n(conductors) \nLoad \nThree elements required to form an electrical circuit \nMarch 2022\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 5 \nIntroduction to electricity \nEnergy sources, potential, and electromotive force \nAn electrical energy source may supply electrical energy in several ways. For example, a wet-cell \nbattery produces electrochemical energy, which is in the form of a potential difference between \nthe charges on the output terminals. This is the measure of the ability (potential) of a Unit of \nelectric charge to do a certain amount of work. You may compare the negative charge at one \nterminal and the positive charge at the other with the low and high-pressure points in a fluid \npiping system. \nThe difference in the potential between the two terminals provides the force to drive the current. \nThis force is the electromotive force (emf). The Unit that indicates the strength of the emf is the \nvolt (V). For example, a power source might be a 12-volt battery. You often call sources of emf \nvoltage sources. \nThe sizes of voltages may vary a great deal, so the size of the Units used can also vary: \nVoltage \nEquivalent \n1 volt (1 V) \n1000 millivolts (= 103 mV) \n1 000 000 microvolts(= 106 µV) \n1 kilovolt (1 kV) \n1000 volts (= 103 V) \n1 megavolt ( 1 MV) \n1 000 000 volts (= 106 V) \nCurrent flow \nElectric current flows_whenever there is a difference of potential across a circuit. Electrons tend to \nflow toward the positive terminal. The amount of voltage across the circuit determines how much \ncurrent can flow through the load. The polarity of the source determines the direction of current \nflow. \nAmpere (A) is a measure of current, which may be quite small or very large: \nCurrent \nEquivalent \n1 ampere (1 A) \n1000-rnHliar:npe.i:es-(-=-103 mA) \n1 000 000 microamperes (= 106 µA) \n1000 amperes \n1 kiloampere (= 1 kA) \nConductors \nThe ease with which a current flows through a conductor varies. In de circuits, the opposition that \na material offers to the flow of current is what you call resistance. \nA conductor in a circuit should have low resistance, allowing maximum current flow. Copper wire \nis the most commonly used conductor. You may use more expensive (even silver) wires in some \nspecialized equipment. \nMaterials with high resistance oppose the flow of current. The Unit of measurement of resistance \nis the ohm (0). Some resistances are very large, so you may use a larger Unit: \nMarch 2022 \n41\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 5 \nIntroduction to electricity \nOhm (0) \nEquivalent \n1 kilohm (1 k 0) \n1000 ohms(= 103 0) \n1 megohm (1 M 0) \n1 000 000 ohms (= 106 0) \nSome are small, for example: \nOhm (0) \nEquivalent \nmilliohm (1 m 0) \n0.001 ohms (= 10-3 O) \n1 microhm (1 µ 0) \n0.000 001 ohms (= 10-6 0) \nLoad \nThe load uses electrical energy to do useful work such as producing motion, light, or sound or \nproviding heating. \nThe load usually has resistance in the electrical circuit. The energy source performs work by \ndriving the current through the resistive load. The term load also refers to the amount of energy \ndemanded from the source. For example, when you increase or decrease the load, it means that \nthe energy source is supplying more or less energy. \nS\"vitches \nA switch opens or closes an electric circuit as required. The simplest type has two pieces of \nconducting metal connected to the conductor of the circuit. You arrange switches so that they can \neasily make or break contact with the conductor. See Figure 3-2. \nFigure 3-2 \nSwitch opens and closes circuit \nSwitch \nLoad \nSwitch opens and closes circuit \nContacts in an electrical relay function as switches in control circuits. These contacts are either \nnormally closed (NC) or normally open (NO). When you energize a relay, the contacts switch \nposition to energize or de-energize circuits. Control circuits frequently employ relays containing \nboth NO and NC contacts depending on the circuit requirements. \n42 \nMarch 2022\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 5 \nIntroduction to electricity \nCircuit protective devices \nCircuit protective devices include: \n• fuses; \n• circuit breakers; and \n• thermal and magnetic overloads. \nOperation of a simple electrical circuit \nElectron flow in a circuit \nAn electric current is the movement of electrons along a conductor. Electrons are extremely small \natomic particles that have a negative electric charge. The flow of these electrons through a \nconductor can cause any combination of the following three effects: \n• heating of the conductor; \n• chemical changes; and \n• production of a magnetic field around the conductor. \nYou can use these effects to power machinery and other devices. \nAn electric circuit is like the flow of water through a piping system. In a piping system, you can \nmeasure the pressure of the water and the volume of water flowing through the system at any \npoint. For water to flow through the pipe, there must be a difference in pressure. The water flows \nfrom the area of higher pressure to the area of lower pressure. If you measure the pressure at \nseveral points in the piping system, it will be lower at each point as measured in the direction of \nflow. You usually measure pressure of a liquid in pounds per square inch (psi) in the imperial \nsystem or in kilopascals (kPa) in the metric system of measurement. \nThe amount of water flowing through a piping system depends on two things: \n• the pressure applied across the piping; and \n• the restrictions in the piping. \nThe greater the pressure applied to the system, the greater the water flow that will occur at a \ngiven resistance. \nThe restrictions in the piping system include length and diameter of pipe, as well as the number \nof fittings. For example, consider two piping systems: one using small-diameter pipe, the other \nusing large-diameter pipe. If you apply the same pressure difference across both piping systems, \nmore water will flow through the system with the larger-diameter pipe. Maintaining this pressure \ndifference will require a larger pump. You often measure water flow in gallons per minute (gal/ \nmin) in the imperial system or in litres per second (Us) in the metric system of measurement. \nVoltage, resistance, and current in a circuit \nThe same variables as water flow affect the flow of electricity. The amount of electricity flowing \nthrough an electric circuit depends on the electrical pressure (termed potential difference or \nvoltage) applied and the restriction (termed resistance) in the wiring circuit. \nMarch 2022 \n43\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 5 \nIntroduction to electricity \nIn an electric circuit, the Units of measurement of voltage and electric current are volts (V) and \namperes (A), respectively. Meanwhile, the ohm is a measure of the restriction in electric circuits, \nwhich is a function of the cross-sectional area of the conductor and the type of material the \nconductor is made of. \nIn Figure 3-3, the top circuit shows a piping system. You use a pump to pump water through the \npiping and back to the tank. The piping system has a valve that you can open and close to control \nthe amount of water flowing through the system. The pump develops the pressure that causes \nthe water to flow. This pressure is greater at the discharge of the pump and drops throughout the \nsystem. It is lowest where the water returns to the tank. A differential pressure gauge connected \nbetween these two points can measure the difference in pressure. \nIf the pump is running and the valve is fully open, there is very little restriction to the flow of water \nthrough the pi",

These are called ferromagnetic materials. Iron, nickel, and cobalt are the only naturally \noccurring ferromagnetic metals. (Steel is ferromagnetic but is made from iron.) \nWhen a magnet strokes ferromagnetic materials across their surface, they also become \nmagnets. Magnets that retain their magnetic effects are permanent magnets. Those that do not \nretain their magnetic effects are temporary magnets. \nElectrons, rr1olccules, and magnetism \nAny conductor of electric current acts like a magnet. In fact, it is spinning electrons that cause \nmagnetic forces. In most atoms, electrons tend to pair off in orbits that have spins in opposite \ndirections. Each spin produces a tiny magnetic field and the magnetic fields of these pairs cancel \neach other. In a magnetic material, however, electrons with similar spins can pair off. Their \nmagnetic fields add together and the molecules of the material have a net magnetic field. See \nFigure 4-1. \n66 \nMarch 2022\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 5 \nIntroduction to electricity \nFigure 4-1 \nMolecular alignment in a magnet \nNonmagnetic \nElectron pair spinning \nin opposite directions \nNon magnetized \nMagnetic \nElectron pair spinning \nin same direction \nMagnetized \nWhen a ferrom.agnetic material is not magnetized, its molecules are randomly oriented. Their \nmagnetic effects work in different directions and cancel each other. In a magnetized metal, the \nmolecules are aligned with each other so that the magnetic effects of the molecules all work \ntogether. This produces a strong magnet. On the other hand, if a magnetic material is partially \nmagnetized, only some of the molecules are aligned. This produces a weak magnet. \nIf the molecules of a magnet become misaligned again, the material loses its magnetism. This \ncan gradually happen. It can also happen if the magnet becomes very hot or receives a strong \nphysical shock. \nMagnetic polarity \nThe magnetic field is strongest at each end of a magnet. These ends are what you call the poles \nof the magnet. \nThe Earth itself acts like a giant magnet and has a magnetic north pole and south pole. When you \nsuspend a magnet (see Figure 4-2) so that it is free to move, it will turn so that one pole always \npoints toward the Earth's North Pole. In the past, this was the north-seeking pole of the magnet \nand diagrams show this with an N. The other pole was the south-seeking pole and this comes \nwith an S in diagrams. \nMarch 2022 \n67\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 5 \nfl \nFigure 4-2 \nMagnetic polarities \nIntroduction to electricity \nThe interaction of a magnet with the earth's magnetic effect is the operating principle of a \ncompass. The needle of a compass is a small permanent magnet that indicates its north-seeking \npole. Regardless of the direction towards which the compass turns, its needle always swivels to \npoint north. \ni: \nIf the north poles of two magnets point toward each other, they repel each other. Two south poles \nalso repel each other. On the other hand, a north and a south pole attract each other. This is the \nlaw of attraction and repulsion: \nLike poles repel, unlike poles attract. \nMagnetic fields \nlines of force \nA magnetic field consists of lines of force that interact with magnetic substances. The most \ncommon magnetic substances are iron and steel. You can make iron magnetic but it will lose its \nmagnetism quickly. Steel, on the other hand, remains magnetic for a longer period. Magnetized \nmetal bars are what you call permanent magnets. \n68 \nMarch 2022\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 5 \nIntroduction to electricity \nFigure 4-3 shows two types of permanent magnet: \n• a bar magnet; and \n• a horseshoe magnet. \nPermanent magnets appear to be ordinary pieces of steel. Even close observation will not reveal \nany visible signs of magnetism. However, if you bring any iron or steel object close to the magnet, \nthe invisible magnetic field will pull it toward the magnet. The magnetic field will only affect \nmagnetic material such as iron, steel, nickel, and cobalt. \nFigure 4-3 \nMagnetic fields \n, , , --: \n_- _- _- _- _- _- _-.-:~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ --' ' \n-\n- - - ►- -\n' \n' \n,' ,' ..... ----\n---- ......

It can act in the magnetic field, the area \nthat surrounds the magnet. In the magnetic field, the force acts in lines of force or flux lines. \nAlthough flux lines are not visible, you can see if you place a small magnet under a sheet of \npaper and sprinkle iron filings over the top of it. When you tap the paper gently, the iron filings \nmove slightly to align themselves along the flux lines. See Figure 4-4. \nMarch 2022 \n69\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 5 \nIntroduction to electricity \nFigure 4-4 \nIron filings aligning themselves along lines of force in a magnetic field \nNotice that flux lines are: \n• more concentrated at the two poles (the magnetic field and force is stronger here); \n• farther apart at greater distances from the magnet (the magnetic field and force is weaker \nhere); and \n• curved and do not cross. \nThe ease with which a material accepts magnetic lines of force is what you call its permeability. \nIron and steel have high permeability. Air, on the other hand, has low permeability. \nWhen you bring together two magnets, their magnetic fields interact. You can clearly see the way \nthe flux lines combine using iron filings. See Figure 4-5. \nFigure 4-5 \nCombined flux line pattern when two magnets are brought together \n=-----= \n~~ \n=~~ \n;;:-~~~~ \n-----=-::::::= \n~-....... -...'~' \nMagnets always have north and south poles. The magnetic lines of force extend from the north \npole of a magnet to the south pole. The poles react with each other. If you bring two north or two \nsouth poles together, they will repel or push away each other. If a north pole and a south pole \ncome together, however, they will attract and stick together (like poles repel and unlike poles \nattract). You use this magnetic field effect to operate electric motors, generators, and other \ndevices. \nSome magnets are stronger than others. A stronger magnet pulls harder and is harder to \nseparate from a magnetic substance. If you place a stronger magnet under the iron filings in \nFigure 4-5, more lines of force will show. The stronger the magnet, the more lines of magnetic \n70 \nMarch 2022\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 5 \nIntroduction to electricity \nforce produced. These lines are what you call flux, and their concentration is what you call flux \ndensity. \nDirection of flux lines \nLines of force are considered to emerge from the magnet's north pole and move toward the south \npole. Diagrams show the direction using arrows (see Figure 4-6). They travel from south to north \nwithin the magnet to form a closed loop. The direction of flux lines is the direction in which the \nnorth-seeking pole of a compass would point. \n. .. \nFigure 4-6 \nDirection of flux lines \n~ \n. \n' . \n. \nPrinciples of basic electromagnetism \nElectromagnetism \nElectromagnetism is magnetism that results from the movement of electrons. Whenever current \nflows in a conductor, a magnetic field forms around the conductor. Also, if you move a conductor \nwithin a magnetic field, the movement will induce a voltage and current will flow in the conductor. \nElectric currents and magnetic fields are inseparable. In the area where current flows, there are \nalways magnetic fields. \nElectromagnets depend upon current flow for their magnetism. If current flow decreases, so does \nthe magnetism. The direction of current flow determines the polarity of the magnet. If the current \nis turned off, the electromagnet is no longer magnetic. \nElectromagnetism in a straight wire \nIf you move around a compass near a straight wire conductor (see Figure 4-7), it shows the \npresence and direction of a magnetic field . The flux lines encircle the wire. If the direction of \ncurrent flow changes, the direction of the magnetic field also changes. \nMarch 2022 \n71\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 5 \nIntroduction to electricity \nFigure 4-7 \nUsing a compass near a conductor to show the presence of a ma",

Batteries have a \npositive and a negative terminal. The battery shown has a voltage of 12 V. In this case, when the \ncircuit is connected, the current flows from one terminal to the other. The flow is always in the \nsame direction and this is what you call direct current (de). \nElectronic devices, small appliances, and automobile electrical systems extensively use direct \ncurrent. Some type of battery often supplies DC. Batteries have a very limited supply of electrical \npower. You must replace or recharge them regularly. This makes them impractical for some \napplications. To supply the large quantities of electrical power required for consumer and \nindustrial needs, mechanical generation is necessary. In most cases, mechanical generators \nproduce alternating current (ac). While in de circuits, current flow is always in the same direction, \nin ac circuits, the current flow switches from one direction to the other (it \"alternates\"). \nIn North America, generators produce and transmit electrical energy as alternating current with a \nfrequency of 60 hertz (cycles per second). This means that the current flows in one direction for \n11120th of a second and then in the other direction for 11120th of a second. This is where current \ndiffers from water piping systems. Although alternating current changes direction continuously, \ntransmission of the energy still occurs throughout the system. \nThe circuits described so far use direct current (de). That is, the current that the energy source \ngenerates flows in one direction only. Its direction is reversed only if the terminal connections are \nreversed. Energy sources that produce direct current are called de energy sources. Batteries are \nde energy sources. \nIn a de energy source, one terminal is always negative and the other positive. The circuit \ndiagrams that this section used so far have used the symbol for a battery (see Figure 5-1, top). \n82 \nMarch 2022\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 5 \nIntroduction to electricity \nFigure 5-1 \nDiagrams of simple de and ac circuits \nDC power \nsource \nAC power \nsource \nAlternating current \n+ \nAnother type of current flows alternately in both directions. The flow changes or alternates \ndirection rapidly and constantly. This is what you call alternating current (ac). The energy \nconsumed in an ac circuit is ac energy. \nMost motors and other devices in the home and industry operate using alternating current. Nearly \nall the energy consumed in the world is alternating current for the following reasons: \n• It is more versatile than de and is usable in a wide variety of ways. \n• It is cheaper to produce than de. \n• It allows transmission of electricity over long distances more economically. \n• It easily transforms into lower or higher voltages for use in various equipment. \n• Transmission of ac energy at high voltage and low current keeps energy losses to a minimum. \n• Many combinations of voltage and current can produce the same energy level. \nIn ac circuits (see Figure 5-1, bottom), current, voltage, and resistance have the same \nrelationships that they have in de circuits. You use Ohm's law to calculate values in ac circuits in \nmuch the same way as for de circuits. \nMarch 2022 \n83\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 5 \nIntroduction to electricity \nThe most common source of ac is the ac generator or alternator. Most ac generators produce an \nelectromotive force (emf) by the rotary movement of a magnetic field within a coil. The movement \nof a conductor in a magnetic field induces a current in the conductor as follows: \n1) \nA conductor moved in a magnetic field, or vice versa, crosses the flux lines. \n2) \nThe field applies a force to the free electrons in the conductor, moving them. \n3) \nThe moving electrons result in a potential difference across the ends of the conductor. \nThe amount of voltage generated depends on: \n• the strength of the magnetic field; \n• how fast the conductor moves, cutting through the flux lines; and \n• the angle at which the conductor cuts the flux lines. \nTo see how a generator works, imagine a single loop or coil of conducting wire placed between \nthe poles of a permanent magnet, as shown in Figure 5-2. In practice, there is a series of \nwindings in the machine called the rotor or armature. \nA simple generator works as follows: \n1) \nAn outside power source such as flowing water, an internal combustion engine, or steam \nturns the coil. \n2) \nAs the loop rotates, the wire cuts the magnetic flux lines, generating a voltage at the ends of \nthe loop. \n3) \nThe generator transfers the voltage to an external circuit via slip rings and brushes. These \nmaintain proper electrical contact while allowing free rotation of the loop. \nIn reality, however, the coil is fixed and the field is made to rotate around it. \n84 \nMarch 2022\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 5 \nIntroduction to electricity \nFigure 5-2 \nThe basic principle of an ac generator \nSingle loop of wire \nSlip rings \nPermanent magnet \n'- Output \nvoltage \n\"-.. \nAs the generator rotates, as in Figure 5-2, a voltage appears across the ends of the coil. The \ngenerator transfers this voltage to an external circuit via slip rings and brushes. \nThe ac \\vaveform \nA complete cycle of alternating current goes from zero to a maximum positive value, back \nthrough zero to a maximum negative value, and back again to zero. The voltage makes a similar \npattern, rather like a wave. \nFigure 5-3 is a graph of these changes with time, which you call the waveform. The correct name \nfor the shape of this waveform is sinusoidal or a sine wave. \nFigure 5-3 \nThe sinusoidal waveform of ac voltage (or current) \n+ \n3 \nV) \n2 \n·x \n(1] \nQJ \n1 \nt>O \n(1] \nTime in \n.:!= \n0 \n0 \nseconds \n> \nI.. \n0 \n-1 \n..... \nC \nQJ \n-2 \nI.. \nI.. \n:J \nu \n-3 \nMarch 2022 \n85\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 5 \nIntroduction to electricity \nAt any point on this sine wave, the magnitude of the voltage (or current) is the distance to the \ntime axis. When the waveform is below the zero line, the current has reversed direction. Note that \nthe waveform is the same shape above and below the horizontal axis (symmetrica/)-the \npositive and negative parts vary in the same way. \nYou may divide the horizontal axis into degrees of rotation rather than Units of time. Figure 5-4 \nshows the 360° in one complete rotation or cycle. This graph shows how the output voltage (or \ncurrent) of the generator varies with the position of the rotor. \nFigure 5-4 \nThe waveform of ac voltage (or current) showing degrees of rotation of the rotor \n3 \n2 \n1 \nQJ \nbJ) \nro \n.,_. \n0 \n0 > \n0 \n.,_. \n-1 \nC \n~ \n::, \nu \n-2 \n-3 \n45° \n90° \n135° \n225° \n270° \n315° \nDegree of \nrotation \nIn Canada, standard ac electrical power goes through 60 complete cycles each second. That is, \nits frequency is 60 cycles per second or 60 hertz (60 Hz). A simple generator would turn 60 times \neach second to produce power at 60 hertz. \nYou can describe phase as the difference in electrical degrees between two waveforms. \nSingle-phase generator \nA single-phase generator produces one alternating (sinusoidal) voltage waveform. \nThree-phase generator \nYou connect three-phase generators to provide three separate circuits. Each of these circuits \ncarries a sinusoidal voltage waveform. The three waveforms are displaced by 120° from each \nother. See Figure 5-5. \n86 \nMarch 2022\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 5 \nIntroduction to electricity \nCalculating alternating current \nAlternating current is somewhat difficult to understand (see Figure 5-4). Mathematically, the \ncurrents might appear to cancel out over time because the negative current during one-half of the \ncycle equals the positive current during the other half. In fact, however, the movement of \nelectrons provides electrical energy. This is true whether they move back and forth or in one \ndirection only. \nYou therefore calculate current by determining the effective work that the electric current \nperforms or heat it generates. This is what you refer to as root-mean-square or rms current and is \nthe peak current (Vmax or Vm) divided by square root of 2 (0.707). \nlrms = 0. 707 lmax \nSimilarly, \nVrms = 0.707 Vmax \nYou always use this value when referring to the voltage of a circuit. Residential voltages in this \ncountry are 120 V, which is the rms voltage. The actual supplied voltage is alternating according \nto a ",

AC power supplies and basic transformer \ntheory and operation \nOverview \nPurpose \nThe gas technician/fitter requires a basic understanding of 120-volt alternating (ac) circuits \ntypically present in a residential application.

Generally, \nelectricity arrives at the receptacle inside a two-conductor cable and includes a ground wire. \nMarch 2022 \n101\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 5 \nIntroduction to electricity \nGenerally, the colour of insulation identifies each wire: \nColour \nIs used for ... \nWhite or natural grey \nInsulated, neutral conductors \nBlack (sometimes red or blue) \nInsulated live or hot conductors \nGreen \nOnly for ground conductors \nEach outlet must have at least 6 inches (150 mm) of free conductor for making joints or for the \nconnection to receptacles. \nYou usually identify the terminals on receptacles to indicate which conductor is to be connected. \nFor example, the neutral wire terminal has a metallic coating for identification, is made of metal \nthat is substantially white (silvery) in colour, or has a \"W\" or \"WHITE\" marking adjacent to the \nterminal. The colour of the ground terminal (screw head, nut, or clamp) is green. \nPrinciples of transformer operation \nSingle-phase transf or1ner operation \nAlthough most large-current transformers are three-phase, for simplicity this section discusses \nonly single-phase. The principle is the same for three phase, except that there are three sets of \nwindings instead of just one. \nFigure 6-1 shows a transformer core with a primary winding and a secondary winding. The \nwindings are actually wound around each other on a real transformer. However, for simplicity of \nunderstanding, the figure shows two separate windings. The current is supplied to the primary \nwinding and the output is from the secondary winding. In this example, there are 100 turns (Np= \n100) in the primary and 1000 turns (Ns = 1000) in the secondary. \n102 \nFigure 6-1 \nSingle-phase transformer \nAlternating current \nVp = 200V \nIp= 10A \nPrimary winding \n(Np= 100) \nLaminated \nsilicon-steel core \nAiternating current \nVs= 2000V \nIs= lA \nSecondary winding \n(Ns = 1000) \nMarch 2022\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 5 \nIntroduction to electricity \nWhen the primary winding of this transformer takes an alternating voltage, a current flows and a \nmagnetic field develops around the winding. Since the alternating current flow is fluctuating at 60 \nHz, the magnetic field will likewise fluctuate. With alternating current, the current increases to a \npeak value, then decreases to zero for each fluctuation. The magnetic field associated with this \ncurrent fluctuates at the same frequency. \nThe flux lines cut through the secondary winding and induce a voltage into the winding. This is \nthe same electromagnetic induction that takes place in a generator. \nIf the number of turns in the secondary winding equals the number of turns in the primary \nwinding, the secondary voltage would equal the primary voltage. Since the secondary winding in \nthis step-up transformer has more turns than the primary, the secondary voltage is greater. This is \ndue to the flux lines cutting through a greater number of secondary winding turns. The greater the \nnumber of turns, the greater the voltage generated. \nTransformer output calculation \nYou can calculate the secondary (output) voltage of a transformer by multiplying the primary \nvoltage by the ratio of turns in the secondary to primary coils. \nVs_ Ns \nVp - Np \nwhere \nVs = secondary voltage \nVp \n= primary voltage \nNs \n= turns in secondary coil \nNp = turns in primary coil \nIn Figure 6-1 , the secondary coil has 1000 turns and the primary has 100 turns. This means that \nthe secondary voltage is 10 times the primary voltage (1000 + 100). Since the primary voltage is \n200 V, then the secondary voltage will be 2000 V (200 x 10). \nTransformer efficiency is very high, so the output power is very close to the input power. Since \npower is a function of the voltage times the current, you can calculate the secondary current if \nyou know the primary current. \nVplp = Vsls \n. \nVp \nTherefore. Is= Vs xlp \nIn the example, the primary current is 10 A. Since output voltage increases by ten times and the \npower remains the same, the current must decrease by ten times. The current in the secondary \nwinding must therefore be 1 A. Since the secondary current is lower than the primary current in a \nstep-up transformer, the size of the conductor in the secondary winding can be smaller. \nTherefore, you can make the winding with the most turns of smaller-diameter wire. \nIn a step-down transformer, the operation is exactly the same. However, the secondary winding \nhas fewer turns than the primary winding so the secondary voltage is less than the primary \nvoltage. Also, the secondary current is greater than the primary current. Figure 6-1 could also \nrepresent a step-down transformer with the primary and secondary windings reversed . \nMarch 2022 \n103\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 5 \nIntroduction to electricity \nTransformers are also self-regulating. This means that, as the current flow through the secondary \nwinding changes, the primary current also changes. If opening a switch or circuit breaker stops \nthe secondary current, the primary current flow also stops. \nFigure 6-2 \nTransformer with open secondary circuit \nAC power \nsupply \nApplied \nvoltage \n/ \nCurrent flow approaching zero \nIp= 0 \nPrimary windings \nInduced voltage \n(back EMF) \nPrimary \nwindings \n--~ \nIs= 0 \nSecondary windings \n~l \nLoad \nJ \nIn the upper portion of Figure 6-2 is a simple coil of conductor that wraps around a steel core. An \nac voltage applied to the coil normally results in a flow of current through the wire. In fact, since \nthere are no resistors in this circuit, a large current flow results. This is the case in a de circuit. But \nin a properly designed alternating current circuit, very little current will flow. \nThe alternating current is again causing a magnetic field to build up and collapse around the coils \n120 times per second. As the lines of flux pass through the primary winding, they induce a \nvoltage in that winding. This induced voltage is the opposite of applied voltage and acts to limit \napplied voltage. For example, if a 60 Hz supply is connected to the coil with a voltage of 220 V, \nthe fluctuating magnetic field induces a voltage in the winding that is equal to the applied voltage, \nbut in the opposite direction. \nThe two voltages (applied and induced) very nearly cancel each other out, so only a very small \ncurrent flows. The induced voltage is often what you call back emf. Another term for source \nvoltage is electromotive force (emf). Back emf plays an important part in limiting the current flow \nthrough electric machines. \n104 \nMarch 2022\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 5 \nIntroduction to electricity \nThe bottom part of Figure 6-2 shows a simple transformer with the secondary circuit open at the \nswitch. Since no current flows through this circuit, it has no effect on the transformer, which \noperates as though there were only one coil. Thus, when the secondary circuit is open, the \nprimary current flow decreases to a very small value. Although there is no current flow in the \nsecondary circuit, the field produced by the very small primary current maintains the terminal \nvoltage of the transformer's secondary winding's terminal voltage. \nWhen the switch is closed and a small load is placed across the secondary circuit, enough \ncurrent flows to supply this load. This current flow in the secondary winding now produces a \nmagnetic field of its own. This is alternating current, so the magnetic field builds up, collapses, \nand passes through the winding coils. The magnetic field that the secondary winding current \nproduced is opposite the magnetic field that the primary winding current produced. \nBecause the secondary field opposes the primary field, the primary field is reduced . This is the \nmagnetic field that produced the back emf. Since the primary field is reduced, the back emf is \nreduced in the primary winding . The reduction in the back emf causes more current to flow in the \nprimary winding. \nAs the secondary load increases, the current flow through the secondary winding increases. This \nincrease in current strengthens the secondary field which, in turn, weakens the primary field. This \nfurther reduces back emf and increases primary current flow. To simplify, any increase in the \nsecondary current flow results in a proportional increase in primary current flow. For this reason, \ntransformers are said to be self-regulating. \nAuto-transformers \nAn autotransformer differs from the transformer described above in that it consists of a single coil, \narranged as shown in Figure 6-3. \nAn autotransformer is a power transformer with one continuous winding, part of which serves as \nthe primary winding and all of which serves as the secondary win",

Multimeters are more commonly used in the field and are often known by other \nnames such as volt-ohm-milliammeter (VOM) and digital multimeter (DMM). A multimeter saves \nhaving to purchase numerous individual meters. \nFeatures of analogue and digital tnultin1eters \nElectrical measuring instruments have traditionally been analogue. Analogue meters consist of a \nneedle-type pointer that moves across a fixed scale. Modern instruments display digitally, using \nliquid-crystal or light-emitting diodes (LED). Digital instruments are not necessarily more accurate \nthan analogue instruments, but they are often easier to read. Digital instruments will retain their \naccuracy regardless of how you position them, while analogue instruments are somewhat \ndelicate and requires placement on a horizontal surface to retain their accuracy. \nDigital multimeters can vary greatly in their operation and functions. Most multimeters can \nmeasure both alternating current (ac) and direct current (de), whereas some voltmeters and \nammeters can measure only one type of current. Always refer to the instrument's operating \ninstruction booklet before using it to confirm its safe and proper use. \nIf you can understand how to use a voltmeter, an ammeter, and an ohmmeter, then it becomes \nvery easy to understand how to use a multimeter. \nMeasuring voltage, current, and resistance \nIn order to measure voltage, you must connect a voltmeter across the two points in the circuit \nwhere the voltage appears (see Figure 7-1) or, in other words, in parallel with the part of the \ncircuit under test. \nFigure 7-1 \nTo measure voltage across resistance R1, voltmeter is connected in parallel with \nR1 \n108 \nMarch 2022\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 5 \nIntroduction to electricity \nIt is very important that the addition of the voltmeter into a circuit has very little effect on the \nconditions normally existing in the circuit. A voltmeter, therefore, must have a very high internal \nresistance, so that operating the instrument will draw very little current from that circuit. For \nmaximum accuracy, a voltmeter's internal resistance should be many times higher than any \nresistance encountered in the circuit under test. Analogue voltmeters have internal resistances in \nthe thousands of ohms, while digital instruments often have internal resistances in the millions of \nohms. \nIn order to measure current, break down the circuit at the point where you will measure the \ncurrent and insert the ammeter (see Figure 7-2). In other words, you must connect an ammeter in \nseries with the circuit under test. (In order to avoid danger, before breaking any circuit to insert an \nammeter, it is first necessary to switch the circuit off.) \nFigure 7-2 \nTo measure current through a circuit, break circuit and insert ammeter in series \nBreak circuit \nR \nIt is very important to note that the insertion of the ammeter is designed to have very little effect \non the normal current flowing in the circuit. The internal resistance of the ammeter is therefore \nvery low, normally a fraction of an ohm. Due to the ammeter's low internal resistance, you must \navoid connecting it across a load under test or the supply voltage itself. This would cause high \ncurrent to flow through the ammeter, seriously damaging the instrument and possibly harming the \noperator. Some ammeters come with a fuse or circuit-breaker for protecting the instrument. \nShould this happen, however, you should never assume that this is adequate protection. \nasn \nOhm's law tells us that, with a fixed value of voltage across a circuit, the value of current flowing \ndepends upon the resistance of that circuit: \n• The higher the resistance, the lower the current flow. \n• The lower the resistance, the higher the current flow. \nIn other words, the value of the current flowing through a circuit is a guide to the resistance of that \ncircuit. This is the principle of operation of the ohmmeter. \nThe ohmmeter is an instrument similar to an ammeter connected in series with a rheostat \n(variable resistor) and a battery (see Figure 7-3). A case with a scale, terminals, and the variable \nresistor's control-knob visible contains these components. The ohmmeter works in the following \nmanner: \n1) \nThe test-leads are connected to the instrument's terminals and are first short-circuited \ntogether. \nMarch 2022 \n109\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 5 \nIntroduction to electricity \n2) \nAdjustment of rheostat occurs until the instrument registers full-scale deflection-this \ncorresponds to zero ohms. \n3) \nNow, the test-leads are connected to the circuit or component under test. \nThe resulting current through the ohmmeter will be lower than it was before, because of the \nadded resistance, and the instrument's pointer will register somewhat less than full-scale \ndeflection. Rather than calibrating the scale in amperes, which is what the instrument is really \nreading, the manufacturer has calibrated it directly in ohms. \nFigure 7-3 \nSchematic of ohmmeter operation \nFull-scale \ndeflection \nr--------------, \nI \nI I t----1''----\\ \nShort leads \ntogether \nScale \nshows \nresistance \n- - - - - - - -\\_-;d::,, rheostat for \nfull-scale deflection \nAnalogue ohmmeter scale \nI ~-------------- .. \nUnknown \nresistance \nUnlike the voltmeter and the ammeter, the most noticeable thing about an analogue ohmmeter's \nscale is that you read it from right to left. Furthermore, it is non-linear. This means that the \ngraduations that represent the higher values of resistance (to the left side of the scale) are very \nclose together, while those representing lower values (to the right side of the scale) have wider \nspacings. See Figure 7-4. \nFigure 7-4 \nNon-linear, analogue ohmmeter scale \nDifficult-to-read scale \nEasy-to-read scale \n= \n0 \nZero ohms adjustment \nUsing the built-in rheostat to adjust for full-scale deflection is what you call zero ohms adjustment. \nYou must perform it before using the ohmmeter to measure resistance. This compensates for any \nvariation in the voltage of the instrument's battery. If you cannot achieve zero ohms adjustment, it \nmeans the battery is too weak and needs replacement. \n110 \nMarch 2022\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 5 \nIntroduction to electricity \nOhmmeter operating precautions: \nDo ... \nDo not/never ... \n. Always be aware of inadvertently \n. Just like the ammeter, an ohmmeter must \nmeasuring the resistance of other \nnever be connected across a live load or \ncomponents that are connected in parallel \nthe supply voltage itself. This would cause \nwith the component under test. You may \nhigh current to flow through the ammeter, \nhave to physically remove the component \nseriously damaging the instrument and \nfrom the circuit before performing the test. \npossibly harming the operator! \n. Technicians/fitters very often use \nohmmeters to check for continuity-to \nconfirm, for example, that a circuit, or \ncomponent, is not open-circuited. When \nchecking continuity, the actual resistance of \nthe circuit or component is unimportant-a \nsimple deflection of the pointer confirms \ncontinuity. \n. Always switch an ohmmeter off when \nmeasurements are completed. If you fail to \ndo this, and the test-leads are accidentally \nleft shorted together, then the instrument's \nbattery will very quickly discharge. \nVariable range instruments \nIn order to extend their versatility, most electrical measuring instruments have several ranges. \nFor example, you may adjust a voltmeter to read: 0 to 5 V, 0 to 10 V, 0 to 25 V, and Oto 100 V. \nScale selection \nAn analogue voltmeter may have four separate scales or only one scale (say, 0 to 5 V), in which \ncase you must multiply its reading by factors of x2, x5, or x20, according to the selected range. \nThe method for selecting the range on such an instrument varies from manufacturer to \nmanufacturer, with the most common being a rotary knob that aligns with ranges engraved onto \nthe case. Modern digital instruments often select the appropriate range automatically. \nRange selection \nIf you are unsure of the value of voltage or current that you are about to measure, always start \nwith the highest range and work down until you achieve the greatest readable deflection of the \npointer. Despite this, you should always estimate the likely value of voltage or current before \nperforming the test, just in case it is beyond even the highest range of the instrument. \nFor maximum accuracy with analogue instruments, always select the range that gives the \ngreatest readable deflection because all instruments are calibrated to give maximum accu",
