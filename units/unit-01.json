          "content": "Chapter 1 - On-the-job safety measures\n\nOverview:\nPurpose: Safety is a shared responsibility among all workers in every trade. Gas technicians/fitters frequently work in potentially dangerous situations with equipment that can cause injury to both themselves and others. Consequently, you must be thoroughly familiar with the hazards you may face, and the safety procedures relevant to work habits, specific work sites, and tools and equipment.\n\nObjectives:\nAt the end of this Chapter, you will be able to:\n• describe personal safety factors;\n• describe site hazards and protections;\n• describe the safety features of tools and equipment; and\n• describe general safe work habits.\n\nTerminology:\n- Confined space: An area in which location, design, or construction restricts entry and exit. In a confined space, there may be work, an atmosphere, operations, or equipment that is hazardous to health and safety.\n- Group safety equipment: Equipment supplied by an employer that is positioned around a job site (e.g., fire extinguishers and a first aid kit)\n- Lockout procedures: Procedures that involve the use of locks and safety tags to ensure the isolation and \"lock-off\" of all sources of potential, kinetic, and stored energy\n- Musculoskeletal disorder hazards (MSDs): An aspect of a job or process that increases the risk of a worker developing an MSD disorder (The primary MSD hazards are related to force, posture, and repetition)\n- Personal protective equipment (PPE): Standard safety equipment (includes clothing)\n- Ventilation equipment: Equipment designed to remove harmful dust or fumes\n\nPersonal safety:\nPersonal safety is a combination of knowledge and awareness. A gas technician/fitter must be knowledgeable and skillful in the use and care of tools and must be aware of the hazards and safety procedures that apply to a job or on a job site. Safe work practices are as important as trade skills, forming the basis of all workplace safety rules.\n\nConsider these factors in relation to personal safety:\n• Work habits\n• MSD hazards\n• Clothing\n• Protective equipment\n\nWork habits:\nA competent worker masters skills to the point where they become second nature. Skilled workers perform their tasks safely and correctly while always being mindful of how their actions may impact the safety of others.\n\nBy adopting the following behaviours, you will become a safer person to work with:\n- Courtesy: Courtesy means taking into account the safety of those you are working with. Put yourself in the other person's shoes and always keep them in mind. (When you recognize a hazard, it is your responsibility to correct it or clearly identify it. Never assume that it is someone else's job.)\n- Attention: To avoid accidents, pay attention to your environment and the people around you.\n- Safe conduct: Safe conduct involves wearing appropriate clothing, using protective equipment, observing good housekeeping and safety procedures, and exercising common sense. Safe conduct also involves following correct procedures in the event of an accident.\n\nMSD hazards and disorders:\nMany jobs have aspects that increase the risk of a worker developing an MSD. While other factors can also increase the risk of MSD, the primary MSD hazards are force, posture (e.g., fixed or awkward postures), and repetition.\n\nMSD Hazard Details:\n1. Force: All work tasks require workers to use their muscles to exert some level of force. However, when a task requires someone to exert a level of force that is too high for any particular muscle, it can damage the muscle or the related tendons, joints, and other soft tissue.\n\n2. Posture: Posture refers to the relative position of various parts of the body. For most joints, a good or \"neutral\" posture means that the joints are being used near the middle of their full range of motion.\n\n3. Repetition: The risk of developing an MSD increases when the same parts of the body are used repeatedly, especially when there are also few breaks or chances to rest.\n\nAdditional MSD hazards and factors in the workplace include: contact stress, vibration (local impact or impact to hand/arm or whole body), cold or hot temperatures/environments, repeated impact, and poor work organization or methods.\n\nProtective Equipment:\nStandard safety clothing (including eye protection and safety footwear) is usually mandatory, but some sites or employers may require you to use additional PPE (e.g., high-visibility clothing). Specifically, you must have equipment to protect your head, lungs, eyes/sight, hands, feet, and ears/hearing.\n\nHead protection (CSA Z94.1 - Class E, Type I or Type II):\nRegulatory authorities and employers may require employees to wear hard hats and other accessories in specific areas, to suit specific job conditions. Most head protection is adjustable, and some have chin straps, liners, and earmuffs. Regulations prohibit employees from altering a hard hat in any way including painting, applying stickers, or drilling holes.\n\nRespiratory (lung) protection (CSA Z94.2 and CSA Z180.1):\nA gas technician/fitter may be exposed to airborne particles, chemicals, toxic gases, and fumes that can cause lung damage when inhaled. In situations that involve exposure to such substances, use an approved mask or respirator.\n\nEye and face protection (CSA Z94.3, CSA Z94.3.1, and CSA Z462):\nEye protection is a critical safety concern for workers on a job site. Workers must wear appropriate eye and face protection suited to their work conditions and the tasks being performed.\n\nHearing protection (CSA Z94.2):\nMany work environments require specific hearing protection. Noise can affect you in several ways: moderate noise levels over a long period can diminish your ability to hear certain types of sounds, high noise levels can impair your hearing, and high noise levels can affect your mental state.\n\nHand protection (CSA Z462 for electrically rated protection):\nStatistics show that approximately 30% of work-related injuries involve a worker's fingers, hands, or arms. Different types of gloves for different purposes: rubber/plastic for chemicals, thermally insulated for hot/cold, gauntlet-type welding gloves, leather/vinyl-coated for handling materials, certified rubber gloves for electrical work.\n\nFoot protection (CSA Z195):\nA gas technician/fitter's working environment requires Grade 1 footwear that complies with CSA Z195. Compliance is indicated by a green equilateral triangle with sides measuring approximately 25 mm (1 in) sewn or otherwise permanently attached to the right shoe upper.\n\nSite hazards and protections:\nA gas technician/fitter works in various capacities across a number of different environments, potentially encountering site-specific work hazards. You must be able to identify hazards and take precautionary measures to protect yourself and others from harm.\n\nPhysical hazards commonly encountered:\n- Working in restricted spaces or cramped work areas\n- Difficulty gaining access to equipment or appliances\n- Exposure to corrosive residues\n- Equipment or appliances that are moving (or non-fixed)\n- Electrical hazards\n- Movement of liquids or solids (in pipes, tubes, or other vessels)\n- Extreme temperatures\n\nConfined spaces:\nA confined space is an area in which location, design, or construction restrict entry and exit. Before engaging in any work within a confined space, you will usually undergo training and certification that is site and situation specific.\n\nLadder safety:\nLadders are essential tools but can be dangerous if used improperly. Key precautions include checking for defects, ensuring proper positioning (4:1 ratio), securing the base, maintaining three points of contact, and avoiding electrical hazards.",

Each province and territory has its own specific acts and regulations that cover safety requirements related to the handling and storage of fuels, fire prevention, work practices, the certification and licensing of tradespersons, etc.\n\nObjective:\nAt the end of this Chapter, you will be able to describe the relevant sections of OHS acts and regulations in different provincial jurisdictions.\n\nTerminology:\n- Act: A legal document that defines the powers of directors, inspectors, etc. An act enables the government to write regulations.\n- Regulation: A legal directive created under the authority of an act to address specific areas and provide detailed requirements and guidelines.\n- Workers' Compensation Board (WCB): An agency responsible for workers' compensation in federal, provincial, or territorial jurisdictions.\n\nOccupational health and safety acts and regulations:\nOHS requirements are governed by provincial and territorial jurisdictions. Most provinces and territories have legislation in the form of regulations and acts dealing with OHS (e.g., OHSA).\n\nActs:\nActs are legal documents that define the powers of directors, inspectors, etc.; they also enable the government to write regulations. A provincial or territorial act that deals with OHS will contain sections on topics such as: application, administration, and enforcement of the act; duties of employers, employees, and others; right to refuse or stop work when health or safety are in danger; employer reprisals; toxic substances; notices; offences; penalties; appeals; and regulations.\n\nRegulations:\nRegulations are legal directives that address specific areas and provide detailed requirements and guidelines. Typically, regulations fall under OHS or WCA, while others are based on energy, fuel, or gas safety acts.\n\nExample regulation requirements:\nIf a gas technician/fitter finds an unacceptable condition or immediate hazard when working with gas, they must:\n• immediately shut off the gas supply to the appliance or work;\n• immediately give verbal notice of their actions to the gas distributor;\n• immediately give the appliance user written notice describing the condition and direction that the appliance not be used until rectified;\n• give written notice of the condition to the distributor within 14 days.\n\nReporting requirements for workers' compensation:\nIn Canada, every worker has the right to a safe workplace. Provincial requirements mandate that hazards be reported within a specific timeframe. Employers must complete paperwork from the relevant provincial body whenever an employee sustains a work-related injury or contracts an occupational disease.",

Knowing what preventive measures to \ntake and how to deal with different types of fires will help gas \ntechnicians/fitters and the workers around them to avoid serious injury or \nproperty damage.\nLearning Objectives\nIdentify Common Fire Hazards\nRecognize potential fire risks in the gas industry environment\nIdentify Classes of Fires\nUnderstand the different classifications of fires and their characteristics\nDescribe Firefighting Equipment\nLearn about various firefighting tools used in the industry\nMatch Equipment with Class of Fire\nKnow how to select the appropriate extinguisher for specific fire types\nKey Terminology\nTerm\nDefinition\nFire extinguisher nameplate\nPlate on fire extinguishers which designate, by means of a rating \ncode, the types of fires for which each extinguisher can be used.\nFirst-aid firefighting\nExtinguishing a fire in its initial stages by using whatever is readily \nat hand, before the fire can get out of control.\nOxidation\nUnion of a substance with oxygen.\nUnderstanding Fire\nFire is the rapid oxidation of a flammable material in the chemical \nprocess of combustion, releasing heat, light, and various reaction \nproducts. Oxidation is defined as the union of a substance with oxygen.\nOxidation takes place at varying rates, from very slow processes like \nrusting iron to extremely fast reactions like exploding gunpowder.\nThe rate of oxidation determines whether a process is considered a fire. \nWhile slow oxidation like rusting is not a fire, fast oxidation like burning \npaper or wood is classified as fire.\nRates of Oxidation\nRate of oxidation\nExample\nVery slow\nRusting iron (not fire)\nSlow\nSpontaneous heating of materials \n(such as oil-soaked rags)\nFast\nBurning paper or wood\nExtremely fast\nExploding gunpowder\nThe Combustion Triangle\nThe combustion triangle illustrates the three elements needed \nfor fire: fuel, heat, and oxygen. When these three elements \ncombine, fire can occur.\nThe advanced combustion tetrahedron adds a fourth element: \nthe uninhibited chemical reaction. This model provides a more \ncomplete understanding of fire behavior.\nComponents of Combustion\nComponent\nWhat is present\nFuel\nFuel must be a combustible material \nsuch as wood, gasoline, paper, or \ncloth.\nHeat (Ignition)\nHeat must be sufficient to raise the \nfuel to ignition temperature.\nOxygen\nOxygen comes usually in the form of \nair, primarily consisting of oxygen \n(O2) and nitrogen (N2).\nUninhibited chemical reaction\nChemical, exothermic reaction that \nis fire.\nFire Prevention Principles\nRemoving Fuel\nShutting off the valve of the gas main is an example of fuel starvation.\nRemoving Heat\nApplying suppressant or water to the fire for cooling.\nRemoving Oxygen\nCovering the fire with a lid, wet blanket, or sand, or use carbon dioxide, foam, or \na dry chemical.\nBreaking Chemical Reaction\nUsing a flashback arrestor to interrupt the combustion process.\nPrincipal Causes of Fire in Gas \nIndustry\nCombustible Materials Near Open Flame\nMaterials that can easily catch fire should be kept away from any open flames.\nGas Leaks\nUndetected gas leaks can lead to dangerous accumulations of flammable gas.\nImproper Cylinder Storage\nLP-gas storage cylinders near oxygen cylinders, electrical circuits, welding tools, or \nflammable liquids.\nDefective Venting Systems\nBroken or improperly installed venting systems can lead to gas buildup.\nMore Causes of Fire in Gas \nIndustry\nCareless Handling of \nGas Cylinders\nImproper transportation or \nhandling of gas cylinders can \nlead to leaks or damage.\nIndoor Storage Issues\nStorage of gas cylinders in \nindoor, badly ventilated \nlocations increases fire risk.\nMixed Cylinder Storage\nStorage of full and empty cylinders in the same vicinity can create \nhazardous conditions.\nWelding and Burning Fire Hazards\nFlying Sparks or Slag\nCan travel great distances and disappear through cracks in \nwalls and floors or into ducts, can immediately result in \nobvious fires or cause smouldering fires.\nWelding Against Wood or Dust\nCan result in a smouldering fire that does not ignite until \nseveral hours after the job is completed.\nPoor Grounding\nDuring welding, sometimes causes electrical motor fires.\nSoldering and Brazing\nAround flammable materials or dusts can ignite fires.\nImproper Torch Use\nImproper use of oxyacetylene torches can lead to fires.\nInadequate Ventilation\nOf storage areas can lead to dangerous gas accumulation.\nElectrical Fire Hazards\nShort Circuits and \nArcing\nElectrical malfunctions that \nproduce heat and sparks \ncapable of igniting nearby \nmaterials.\nBroken Electrical \nWiring\nDamaged wires can \nexpose conductors and \ncreate fire hazards when in \ncontact with flammable \nmaterials.\nLight Bulbs Near \nFlammables\nLight bulbs in contact with \nfine dust or oily surfaces \ncan generate enough heat \nto cause ignition.\nUnprotected \nEquipment\nUnprotected bulbs and \nunshielded switches in \ndusty areas create fire \nrisks.\nFriction and Worker-Related Fire Hazards\nFriction Hazards\n•\nFallen material resting on fast-moving equipment, such as a belt\n•\nA belt running off-centre and rubbing against a fixed surface\n•\nHot bearings igniting oil or dust\nWorker-Engendered Hazards\n•\nWorkers ignoring No Smoking signs\n•\nWorkers ignoring gas ventilation and dust-abatement regulations\n•\nWorkers with sloppy housekeeping practices\nClasses of Fires\nFires are divided into main types or classes, which dictate the type of \nextinguisher required to fight them. Fires are rated by type: A, B, C, D, and \nK. These designations are also used to rate fire extinguishers.\nUnderstanding these classifications is crucial for selecting the appropriate \nfirefighting equipment. Each class represents different types of fires with \nspecific characteristics and extinguishing requirements.\nClass A Fires\nClass A fires involve ordinary combustibles such as wood, cloth, \npaper, rubber, and many plastics. These materials leave ash when \nthey burn.\nSymbol\nGreen triangle with the letter \"A\"\nPictogram\nBurning trash can and wood pile\nExtinguishing Agent\nA wet or dry formula or other clean agent systems (i.e., halon, \nnitrogen, argon, and carbon dioxide) that use heat-absorbing \n(cooling) effects to retard combustion.\nClass B Fires\nSymbol\nRed square with the letter \"B\"\nPictogram\nBurning fuel can\nType of Fire\nFlammable or combustible vapors\nExtinguishing Agent\nUses extinguishers that prevent these vapors from being released or \nthat interrupt combustion. Extinguishes fires via oxygen depletion.\nClass B fires involve flammable liquids such as gasoline, oil, grease, \ntar, oil-based paint, lacquer, and flammable gases. These fires require \nspecial extinguishing agents that can smother the flames by \npreventing vapor release.\nClass C Fires\nClass C fires involve energized electrical equipment such as wiring, circuit \nbreakers, machinery, or appliances. The primary danger with these fires is \nthe risk of electrical shock, which requires non-conductive extinguishing \nagents.\nSymbol\nBlue circle with the letter \"C\"\nPictogram\nBurning electrical plug and outlet\nExtinguishing Agent\nUses non-conductive extinguishing agents to protect the operator (you can \nuse Class A or B extinguishers only when electrical equipment is de-\nenergized).\nClass D Fires\nSymbol\nYellow star with the letter \"D\"\nPictogram\nNone\nType of Fire\nCertain combustible metals, such as magnesium, titanium, zirconium, sodium, or potassium\nExtinguishing Agent\nA dry powder that absorbs heat and smothers the flames, cutting off oxygen. Uses heat-absorbing \nextinguishing medium not reactive with the burning materials.\nClass K Fires\nClass K fires involve vegetable oils, animal oils, or fats in cooking \nappliances. These fires are particularly dangerous in commercial \nkitchens where they can spread quickly and are difficult to \nextinguish with conventional methods.\nSymbol\nBlack hexagon with the letter \"K\"\nPictogram\nBurning pan\nExtinguishing Agent\nA wet chemical that reacts specifically with vegetable oils, animal \noils, or fats in cooking appliances to form a foam that blankets the \nsurface of the blazing substance, smothering the fire.\nFire Extinguisher Types\nFire extinguishers are a gas technician/fitter's main firefighting tools of concern. It can be critical that gas technicians/fitters know the location of and method of operating each extinguisher in their workplace.\nWater Extinguisher\nEffective on Class A fires (ordinary combustibles)\nDry Chemical Extinguisher\nSome types are effective on multiple classes of fires\nCO2 Extinguisher\nEffective on Class B and C fires\nSpecialized Fire Extinguishers\nClass D Extinguisher\nSpecifically designed for flammable metals\nClass K Extinguisher\nDesigned for cooking oils and fats in commercial kitchens\nMultipurpose Extinguisher\nEffective on multiple classes of fires\nFire Extinguisher Markings\nSince each manufacturer uses a slightly different operating \nprocedure, you should look carefully at the markings and \ninstructions on the extinguisher.\nThese markings will tell you how you can most effectively use \nthe extinguisher. The nameplate contains important information \nabout:\n•\nThe types of fires the extinguisher can be used on\n•\nOperating instructions\n•\nMaintenance requirements\n•\nTesting information\nFirst-Aid Firefighting\nDefinition\nFirst-aid firefighting is extinguishing a fire in its initial stages by \nusing whatever is readily at hand, before the fire can get out of \ncontrol.\nHome and Office Use\nFire extinguishers used in homes and offices are designed to \ndeal with fires in their infancy. They are still necessary even \nthough sprinkler systems and other devices may protect an \narea.\nMetal Fire Awareness\nAlthough fires fueled by metal are rare, being aware of the \npotential risks is important.

Government acts and regulations \nOverview \nPurpose \nGovernment acts and regulations provide workplace requirements. Many of these requirements \nwill directly affect the workplace of the gas technician/fitter and it is therefore important for the \nstudents to become familiar with these regulations for their benefit and safety. \nObjectives \nAt the end of this Chapter you will be able to: \n• describe the relevant sections of the occupational health and safety acts and regulations in the \nprovincial jurisdiction that covers the site of work. \nMarch 2022 \n37\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 1 \nSafety \nTerm \nAbbreviation \nDefinition \n(Symbol) \nAct \nLegal document that determines the powers of \ndirectors, inspectors, etc., as well as enabling \nthe government to write regulations. \nRegulation \nLegal directive that focuses on specific areas \nmade under an act. \nWorkers' \nWCB \nAgencies responsible for workers' \nCompensatioh \ncompensation in the federal, provincial, and \nBoard \nterritorial jurisdictions. \nOccupational health and safety acts and \nregulations \nRequirements for occupational health and safety are governed by provincial jurisdiction. Most \nprovinces have legislation in the form of regulations and acts dealing with occupational health \nand safety [(e.g., Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA)]. The gas technician/fitter must \nstudy and become familiar with these acts and regulations for the jurisdiction in which he or she \nwill practice (see Table 2-1 ). \nThis section describes what one can expect to find in the acts and regulations and indicates \nsome important sections that have direct relevance to the gas technician's/fitter's trade. It is \nstrongly suggested that you obtain the local acts and regulations and study them so that you may \nbe informed and knowledgeable. \nacts \nAn act is a legal document that determines the powers of directors, inspectors, etc., as well as \nenabling the government to write regulations. \nThe provincial act dealing with occupational health and safety (e.g., OHSA or in some \njurisdictions, a Workers Compensation Act) contains sections dealing with subjects such as \napplication; administration; duties of employers, workers, and others; toxic substances; right to \nrefuse or to stop work where health and safety are in danger; prohibition of reprisals by \nemployers; notices; enforcement; offences; penalties; appeals; and regulations. \nOther provincial acts deal with energy, fuel, or gas safety and typically address the powers of \ndirectors, inspectors, etc., as well as enabling the government to write regulations associated \nwith the use and installation of gas/propane/oil equipment and the safe handling and storage of \nfuels (see Table 2-1 ). \n38 \nMarch 2022\nThe regulations \nRegulations are legal directives that focus on specific areas. Typically, there are Regulations \nmade under OH&S or Workers Compensation Acts and other Regulations made under energy, \nfuel, or gas safety acts. See Table 2-1. \nRegulations under OH&S or workers compensation acts typically cover construction site \nrequirements in areas such as general construction, excavations, tunnels, shafts, caissons, and \ncofferdams, and work in compressed air. In addition, they may contain indexes on OH&S, \nconstruction and other regulations that directly affect OH&S, and Ministry office locations. The \nindexes are particularly useful when trying to find information in either OH&S or the Regulations. \nRegulations made under an act (e.g., energy, fuels, gas, or safety codes act) or requirements \nwithin an act itself, typically include specific responsibilities for a gas technician/fitter and others \nwhen a potentially dangerous condition is associated with the installation or operation of gas \nequipment. For example, one provincial regulation states that if a gas technician/fitter finds that \nan unacceptable condition of a gas appliance or work is an immediate hazard, the gas technician/ \nfitter must: \n• immediately shut off the supply of gas to the appliance or work; \n• immediately give oral notice of the holder's actions to the gas distributor; \n• immediately give to the user a written notice: \n-\ndescribing the condition that constitutes an immediate hazard, and \n-\ndirecting that the appliance or work not be used until the condition is corrected ; and \n• give written notice of the condition to the distributor, including notice of gas supply shutoff, \nwithin 14 days of finding the condition. \nIn addition, this regulation states that a gas technician/fitter who finds that an appliance or work is \nin an unacceptable condition not constituting an immediate hazard must: \n• immediately give oral notice of the condition to the distributor of gas to the appliance of work \n• immediately give written notice to the user of the appliance or work describing the condition \nand advising that the distributor receives the notice of the condition; and \n• give written notice of the condition to the distributor within 14 days of finding the condition. \nMarch 2022 \n39\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 1 \n;:,arety \nTable 2-1 \nProvincial acts and regulations pertaining to safety \n(applicable to gas technicians/fitters-not all inclusive) \nNote: Acts and regulations are revised periodically.

Hazardous materials \nOverview \nPurpose \nIn the gas industry, technicians/fitters will be exposed to a variety of potentially toxic and \nexplosive materials. Federal and provincial legislation provides for the gas technician's/fitter's \nright to know, as a Canadian worker, about the major risks they can expect and the safety \nprotection measures required to be in place wherever hazardous materials are present. \nObjectives \nAt the end of this Chapter you will be able to: \n• describe the Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS); and \n• describe safe handling, storage, disposal, and transportation of hazardous materials. \nMarch 2022 \n49\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 1 \nSafety \nTerm \nAbbreviation \nDefinition \n(symbol) \nGlobally \nGHS \nInternationally agreed-upon system to classify \nHarmonized \nand label chemicals including easy-to-\nSystem of \nunderstand symbols. \nClassification and \nLabeling of \nChemicals \nLiquid propane gas \nLP-gas \nOne type of common fuel. \nMaterial safety \nMSDS \nDocument that provides workers and \ndata sheet \nemergency personnel with procedures for \nhandling or working with that substance in a \nsafe manner. \nParts per million \nppm \nValue that represents the part of a whole \nnumber in Units of 1/1,000,000. \nSafety data sheet \nsos \nDocument, adopted under WHMIS 2015 that \nprovides workers and emergency personnel \nwith procedures for handling or working with \nhazardous products in a safe manner. \nSewer gas \nMixture of vapours, odours, and gases found in \na sewer. \nSolvents \nLiquids that dissolve other substances. \nWorkplace \nWHMIS \nProvides workers, employers, and suppliers of \nHazardous \nmaterials with vital information about hazardous \nMaterials \nmaterials in the workplace. WHMIS 2015 was \nInformation System \nupdated in 2015. \nWorkplace Hazardous Materials Information \nSystem (WHMIS 2015) \nThe Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS), established in 1988 and \nupdated through legislation in 2015, provides workers, employers, and suppliers of materials with \nvital information about hazardous materials in the workplace. Gas technicians/fitters often come \ninto contact with hazardous products. It is essential that you: \n• understand your rights and responsibilities relating to WHMIS 2015; and \n• good housekeeping practices you should maintain to ensure your safety and that of others \nworking around you. \nWHMIS 2015, updated in February 2015, moves to align with the Globally Harmonized System of \nClassification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS), created by the United Nations (UN). It is \nimportant to note that Canada's regulations do have differences from the UN GHS. \n50 \nMarch 2022\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 1 \nSafety \nGHS includes terminology that has specific meaning to chemicals and hazardous products: \nGHS term \nDescription \nHazard group \nPhysical hazards group (based on physical or chemical property) \nHealth hazards group (based on the health effect of the product) \nHazard class \nProducts that have similar hazardous properties. \nExamples: Flammable gases, oxidizing liquids, gases under pressure, \nacute toxicity, aspiration hazard, etc. \nHazard category \nHow hazardous the product is. \nExamples: Category 1, 1 B, 2, 2A, etc. \nWhile GHS does not replace WHMIS, it does enhance components of WHMIS. Under WHMIS \n2015, workers have access to information on hazardous materials and products on labels and on \nseparate data information sheets. \nIn WHMIS 2015, GHS includes standardized label elements: \nGHS label element \nDescription \nSymbols \n. GHS hazard pictograms . \nSignal words \n. Only two signal words used, with only one appearing on a label. \n-\n\"Danger\" for more severe hazards. \n-\n\"Warning\" for less severe hazards. \nHazard statements . Brief, standardized statements to describe the product's hazards . \n. Includes phrases assigned to a hazard class and hazard category . \nPrecautionary \n. Types focus on \"general\", \"prevention\", \"response\", \"storage\", and \nstatements \n\"disposal\" information on how to minimize or prevent harmful effects \nfrom the product. \nThe previous version of WHMIS enabled the additional presentation of the hazardous products \ninformation on materials safety data sheets (MSDS). With GHS adopted in WHMIS 2015, this \ninformation is now presented on safety data sheets (SOS). \nEmployers are required to establish education and training programs for workers exposed to \nhazardous products in the workplace. Employers must also ensure that the products are labelled, \nthat SOS are present for each product, and that these labels and SOS are readily available to \nworkers. \nWorkers are required to participate in the education and training programs and use this \ninformation to help them work safely with hazardous products. They may inform employers when \nlabels on containers have been accidentally removed or if the label is no longer readable. \nMarch 2022 \n51\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 1 \nS 2015 legislation \nWHMIS 2015 regulations lay out the legal steps that employers and suppliers of hazardous \nproducts must follow to ensure the protection of workers' health and safety. \nSafety \nWHMIS 2015 leaflets (obtainable through the provincial Workers Compensation Board, Workers \nSafety Insurance Board, or equivalent) explain about both: \n• Federal hazardous products and controlled products legislation. \n• Provincial jurisdiction(s) over hazardous products. \nFederal legislation deals with the importation and sale of controlled products. This includes \nestablishing criteria for including hazardous products and requirements for suppliers to provide \nappropriate labels and SOS. \nAt the federal level, WHMIS 2015 legislation includes the amended Hazardous Products Act and \nthe new Hazardous Products Regulation (HPR). \nNew GHS labelling includes two distinct labels: \nGHS label type \nRequirements \nSupplier label \n. Provided or affixed (attached) by the supplier . \n. Appears on all hazardous products received at a workplace in Canada . \n. For hazardous product always used in the container with the supplier \nlabel, no other label is required. \nWorkplace label \nRequired when a: \n. hazardous product is produced (made) at the workplace and used in that \nworkplace; \n. hazardous product is decanted (e.g., transferred or poured) into another \ncontainer; or \n• supplier label becomes lost or illegible (unreadable) . \nProvincial legislation is concerned with the storage, handling, and use of hazardous products in \nthe workplace. Through amendments to the Occupational Safety and Health Regulations, \nprovincial legislation ensures the employer will provide worker education and training on \nhazardous products. \nIf you handle hazardous products that the employer produced and observe that additional/ \ndifferent procedures or precautions are necessary, you are responsible for notifying your \nsupervisor so that the employer will add this updated information to the SOS. \nInformation on and updating of a SOS: \n52 \nMarch 2022\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 1 \nSafety \nUpdating requirement \nFormat \nInformation sections \nAre updated when the \nSOS are more detailed than a \nContain 16 information \nsupplier is making significant \nhazard product supplier label \nsections on a hazardous \nchanges to the SOS. \nor workplace label and \nproduct, with sections 12-15 \nprovide detailed hazard \noptional for the supplier of the \nCommunicate significant \ninformation. \nproduct to include. \nchanges as soon as possible \nto the consumer. \nData sheet information and pictograms for SDS \nSDS: Sixteen sections under WHMIS 2015 \nSection/heading \nInformation \n1 \nIdentification \n• Product identifier (e.g., product name) \n.

Oxidation is defined as the union of a \nsubstance with oxygen. Oxidation takes place at varying rates, as shown in the examples in \nTable 4-1. \nTable 4-1 \nDifferent rates of oxidation \nRate of oxidation \nExample \nVery slow \nRusting iron (not fire) \nSlow \nSpontaneous heating of materials (such as oil-soaked rags) \nFast \nBurning paper or wood \nExtremely fast \nExploding gunpowder \nThe combustion triangle (tetrahedron) \nBefore a fire can occur, four components must be present: \nComponent \nWhat is present \nFuel \nFuel must be a combustible material such as wood, gasoline, \npaper, or cloth. \nHeat (Ignition) \nHeat must be sufficient to raise the fuel to ignition temperature. \nOxygen \nOxygen comes usually in the form of air, primarily consisting of \noxygen (02) and nitrogen (N2). \nUninhibited chemical \nChem_ical, exothermic reaction that is fire. \nreaction \n70 \nMarch 2022\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 1 \nSafety \nThese components are represented graphically as the combustion triangle (or tetrahedron) \n(Figure 4-1 ). Later Units and Chapters explain the combustion triangle and process in greater \ndetail. \nFigure 4-1 \nThe combustion triangle and advanced combustion triangle \nContent on the combustion triangle and the advanced combustion triangle is excerpted \nfrom the \"Combustion analysis and fuel efficiency\" manual courtesy of ESCO Group. For \nadditional information on combustion analysis, visit http://www.escogroup.org/. \nYou can prevent the occurrence of fire by keeping the required four components of combustion \nseparated. In the same way, removal of any one of the four components will extinguish an \nexisting fire: \nExtinguish a fire by ... \nExample \nRemoving the fuel from the vicinity of the fire, \nShutting off the valve of the gas main is an \nwhich results in fuel starvation. \nexample of fuel starvation. \nRemoving the heat, which results in cooling. \nApplying suppressant or water to the fire. \nRemoving the oxygen to cause smothering of \nCovering the fire with a lid, wet blanket, or \nthe fire. \nsand, or use carbon dioxide, foam, or a dry \nchemical (as contained in fire extinguishers). \nBreaking up the chemical reaction needed for \nUsing a flashback arrestor. \nself-sustained combustion. \nPrincipal causes of fire \nIn the gas industry, you will encounter a number of preventable causes of fire. Some examples of \ncauses include: \n• combustible materials near open flame \n• gas leaks \n• proximity of LP-gas storage cylinders to oxygen cylinders, electrical circuits, welding or \nburning tools, gasoline, or other highly flammable liquids \n• defective or broken venting systems \n• careless handling or transportation of gas cylinders \n• storage of gas cylinders in indoor, badly ventilated locations \nMarch 2022 \n71\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 1 \nSafety \n• storage of full and empty cylinders in the same vicinity \nDuring particular work, be aware of the following fire hazards: \nFire hazard \nExample \nWelding and \n• Flying sparks or slag, which can travel great distances and disappear \nburning \nthrough cracks in walls and floors or into ducts, can immediately result \nin obvious fires or cause smouldering fires. \n. Welding against a wooden back or dust, which can result in a \nsmouldering fire that does not ignite until several hours after the job is \ncompleted. \n• Poor grounding during welding, which sometimes causes electrical \nmotor fires \n• Soldering and brazing around flammable materials or dusts \n. Improper use of oxyacetylene torches \n. Inadequate ventilation of storage areas \nElectrical sources . Short circuits and arcing \n. Broken electrical wiring \n. Light bulbs in contact with fine dust or oily surfaces \n• Unprotected bulbs and unshielded switches in dusty areas \nFriction \n. Fallen material resting on fast-moving equipment, such as a belt \n. A belt running off-centre and rubbing against a fixed surface \n. Hot bearings igniting oil or dust \nWorker-\n. Workers ignoring No Smoking signs \nengendered \n. Workers ignoring gas ventilation and dust-abatement regulations \n. Workers with sloppy housekeeping practices \nTypes of fires \nFires are divided into main types or classes, which dictate the type of extinguisher required to \nfight them. Fires are rated by type: A, B, C, D, and K. Designations that coincide with each of \nthese types- A, B, C, D and K-are also used to rate fire extinguishers. \nThe following symbols or pictograms (Table 4-2) may be the main or only indications you will \nhave of the best use of a fire extinguisher.

Three primary MSD hazards: \n• \nForce \n• \nPosture \n• \nRepetition \n12. Three main atmospheric hazards in confined spaces: \n• \nCombustible gases \n• \nOxygen levels (too much or too little) \n• \nToxic fumes \n13. Three items to remove around electrical equipment: \n• \nRings \n• \nMetal watchbands \n• \nBracelets \n• \nLoose ties \n• \nNeck chains (Any three of these items are acceptable) \n14. Four key steps for identifying physical hazards: \n• \nExternal inspection (inspect confined space from outside) \n• \nEquipment assessment (identify equipment that can suffer adverse effects) \n• \nSite plan review (check with site manager and other tradespersons) \n• \nElectrical hazard check (check for exposed conductors or energized equipment)\n15. Three main work habits for safety: \n• \nCourtesy \n• \nAttention \n• \nSafe conduct \nPart C: Case Study Answer Guidelines \n16. Ladder safety violations in Scenario 1: \n• \nLadder positioned at incorrect angle (too steep) \n• \nBase on unstable surface (loose gravel) \n• \nWorking near power lines (aluminum ladders particularly dangerous) \n• \nCarrying tools while climbing (should use hoist rope/bucket) \n• \nNot wearing proper eye protection (prescription glasses insufficient) \n• \nNo inspection of ladder condition mentioned \n• \nWorking alone at height without proper fall protection \n17. Steps John should take: \n• \nInspect ladder for defects before use \n• \nPosition ladder at proper 3:1 ratio (1 ft out for every 3 ft up) \n• \nEnsure stable, level base surface \n• \nVerify clearance from power lines (maintain safe distance) \n• \nUse proper eye protection \n• \nUse hoist rope/bucket for tools \n• \nEnsure someone else is present/aware of work \n• \nCheck that ladder extends 3 ft above landing point \n18. Major safety concerns in Scenario 2: \n• \nConfined space entry without proper procedures \n• \nNo atmospheric testing performed \n• \nUnusual air smell indicates potential atmospheric hazard \n• \nWorker lacks confined space training/certification \n• \nInadequate lighting \n• \nMissing specialized confined space equipment (gas monitor, ventilation, retrieval \nequipment) \n• \nNo rescue plan or standby person \n• \nNo permit system in place \n19. Required procedures and equipment for Maria: \n• \nObtain proper confined space training and certification \n• \nConduct atmospheric testing before entry and continuously during work \n• \nImplement proper ventilation system\n• \nHave standby person outside space \n• \nUse appropriate PPE (respirator if needed) \n• \nEstablish communication system \n• \nHave rescue/retrieval equipment ready \n• \nObtain confined space entry permit \n• \nUse proper lighting (explosion-proof if required) \n• \nHave emergency procedures in place \n20.

You suspect a chlorine leak from nearby \nequipment. The concentration seems low, but you're unsure of the exact levels.\n15. Outline the immediate actions you should take in this situation, including safety \nprocedures, exposure limits to consider, and who you should contact. Explain why chlorine \nis particularly dangerous and what health effects you might experience.\nANSWER KEY \nPART A: MULTIPLE CHOICE \n1. c) Workplace Hazardous Material Information System \n2. d) Globally Harmonized System (GHS) \n3. c) Physical and Health \n4. b) Safety Data Sheet (SDS) \n5. c) 16 sections \n6. b) Warning and Danger \n7. d) Absorption through clothing \n8. b) 1% - 16% \n9. c) Chlorine \n10. c) 15-30 ppm \nPART B: SHORT ANSWER \n11. Three main categories of hazardous materials: a) Liquid solvents, glues, and resins b) \nToxic materials c) Common fuel gases \n12. Difference between supplier and workplace labels: A supplier label is provided or affixed \nby the supplier and appears on all hazardous products received at a workplace in Canada. For \nproducts always used in the original container, no other label is required. A workplace label is \nrequired when: a hazardous product is produced at the workplace and used there; a hazardous \nproduct is transferred into another container; or when a supplier label becomes lost or illegible. \n13. Three general safety precautions for liquid solvents: (Any three of the following) a) Use \nonly approved containers in good condition and keep them tightly closed when not in use b) \nAvoid skin contact and practice proper personal hygiene c) Always use personal protective \nequipment (PPE) and special protective devices d) Clean up liquid spills immediately and put \ncleanup rags in designated containers e) Check grounding of large drums containing flammable \nliquids \nPART C: CASE STUDIES \n14. PVC Cement Safety Precautions: \n• \nEnsure adequate ventilation or move work to a well-ventilated area \n• \nUse appropriate PPE including safety glasses/goggles and chemical-resistant gloves \n• \nApply solvent cement with a brush to avoid skin contact \n• \nNo smoking or open flames in the work area due to flammable vapors \n• \nKeep containers tightly sealed when not in use \n• \nHave proper first aid measures available (flush eyes with water if contact occurs)\n• \nFollow manufacturer's SDS instructions \n• \nConsider using respiratory protection in poorly ventilated spaces \n15.

Explain the difference between Class A and Class B fires, including what types of materials are involved in each.\nPART C: CASE STUDY SCENARIOS (2 scenarios)\nScenario 1: You are working in a commercial kitchen installing a new gas appliance. While working, you notice a small fire has started in a deep fryer containing cooking oil. The flames are beginning to spread across the surface of the oil, but the fire is still relatively small. You see several fire extinguishers mounted on the wall nearby: a Class A (water-based), a Class B (dry chemical), and a Class K (wet chemical) extinguisher.\n14. Which fire extinguisher should you use for this situation and why? Explain the fire classification system that applies here and describe what would happen if you used the wrong type of extinguisher.\nScenario 2: During a welding operation on a gas piping system, sparks from your welding torch ignite some wood shavings and paper materials stored nearby. At the same time, an electrical motor in the area begins sparking due to poor grounding. The fire is spreading to both the combustible materials and appears to be involving the electrical equipment.\n15. Describe the step-by-step approach you would take to safely extinguish this fire. Include which fire classes are involved, what type(s) of extinguisher(s) you would use, and what safety precautions you must take regarding the electrical hazard. Also explain how this situation demonstrates the combustion tetrahedron.\nANSWER KEY\nPART A: MULTIPLE CHOICE\nd) Exploding gunpowder\nb) Four components\nb) Fuel starvation\nc) A, B, C, D, and K\nb) Class B\nc) Class C\nc) Dry powder\nb) Extinguishing a fire in its initial stages using readily available materials\nd) Class K\nc) The types of fires for which each extinguisher can be used\nPART B: SHORT ANSWER\n11. Four components of combustion tetrahedron: a) Fuel (combustible material) b) Heat (ignition temperature) c) Oxygen (usually from air) d) Uninhibited chemical reaction\n12. Three principal causes of fire: (Any three of the following) a) Combustible materials near open flame b) Gas leaks c) Proximity of LP-gas storage cylinders to oxygen cylinders, electrical circuits, welding tools, or flammable liquids d) Defective or broken venting systems e) Careless handling or transportation of gas cylinders f) Storage of gas cylinders in indoor, badly ventilated locations\n13. Difference between Class A and Class B fires: Class A fires involve ordinary combustibles such as wood, cloth, paper, rubber, and many plastics. These fires can be extinguished with water or other cooling agents. Class B fires involve flammable or combustible liquids and vapors such as gasoline, diesel fuel, oils, and solvents. These fires require extinguishing agents that prevent vapors from being released or interrupt combustion, typically using foam, dry chemical, or carbon dioxide.\nPART C: CASE STUDIES\n14. Class K Fire Extinguisher Selection: You should use the Class K (wet chemical) extinguisher. This fire involves cooking oils and fats in a commercial kitchen setting, which is specifically a Class K fire. The Class K extinguisher dispenses a fine mist that doesn't splash blazing oil and contains potassium acetate that reacts with the oils to form a foam blanket that smothers the fire. Using a Class A (water) extinguisher would be extremely dangerous as water and hot oil don't mix and could cause the fire to spread violently. A Class B extinguisher might work temporarily but is not designed for the specific chemistry of cooking oils and would not provide the long-term suppression needed.\n15. Multi-Class Fire Response: This scenario involves both Class A (wood shavings and paper) and Class C (energized electrical equipment) fires. Step-by-step approach:\nSafety first: De-energize the electrical equipment if safely possible, turning it into a Class A fire\nFire classification: If electrical cannot be de-energized, this remains a Class C fire requiring non-conductive extinguishing agents\nExtinguisher selection: Use a dry chemical (ABC) extinguisher that can handle both Class A and Class C fires, or CO2 for electrical safety\nApplication: Attack the fire from the fuel side, sweeping at the base of flames\nCombustion tetrahedron demonstration: This fire shows all four elements - fuel (wood/paper), heat (welding sparks), oxygen (air), and chemical reaction. The fire can be extinguished by removing fuel (clearing combustibles), removing heat (cooling agents), removing oxygen (smothering), or breaking the chemical chain reaction (dry chemical agents)\nFollow-up: Ensure electrical issues are resolved before re-energizing equipment",
