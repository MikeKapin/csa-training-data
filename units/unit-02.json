It is essential that \nanything you fasten rem ains in its original position. You should select a fastening device or design of a support or bracket with \ncare.\nEnsuring Secure Installations\nSelect Correct Size and Grade\nChoose screws or bolts of the correct size and grade for the application.\nUse Proper Inserts and Plugs\nSelect the correct inserts, plugs, and shields that you m ust drill or place in \nconcrete, and set them  properly.\nAccount for Movem ent\nConsider expansion, contraction, and vibration, and take appropriate \nm easures to ensure the piping or equipm ent rem ains in place.\nUse Adequate Support\nUse the proper num ber of fasteners and supports for the weight or \nsize of the piping and equipm ent.\nGeneral Fasteners Overview\nVariety of Options\nA huge variety of fasteners is available to the gas technician/ fitter. \nTheir designs are job- specific, so you m ust take care in selecting \nthem .\nAttention to Detail\nSm all details can have a great effect on their function. Be sure to \nstore all fasteners in a clean and dry environm ent once purchased.\nTypes of Screws\nWood \nScrews\nUsed for \nfastening to \nwooden \nm aterials\nMetal \nScrews\nUsed for \nfastening to \nm etal surfaces\nMachine \nScrews\nUsed with nuts \nor in threaded \nholes\nSet Screws\nUsed to prevent \nm ovem ent \nbetween parts\nThere are m any different types of screws, which com e in varying sizes, \nlengths, and head types, but have one purpose -  to fasten one object to \nanother. Gas technicians/ fitters extensively use all types.\nSelf- Tapping Metal Screws\nPurpose\nCreate their own threads as they are driven into m aterial\nApplications\nCom m only used for sheet m etal and thin m aterials\nAdvantages\nNo need for pre- tapping or nuts\nVarieties\nAvailable in different head styles and thread patterns\nLag Bolts\nDefinition\nLag bolts are not actually bolts; they are heavy screws that \nhelp fasten brackets to wooden m em bers.\nApplications\nThey are a practical alternative to a nut and bolt \narrangem ent, although larger sizes of lag bolts m ay require a \npilot hole.\nUsage in Gas Industry\nCom m only used for securing heavy equipm ent and brackets \nto wooden structural m em bers.\nBolts and Nuts\nVarieties\nBolts are available in various lengths, sizes, and configurations. \nThey fasten objects into a set position by the leverage of the \nthread.\nThread Types\nThe thread on the bolt can be either National Fine (NF) or the \nmore commonly used National Coarse (NC).\nMeasurem ent\nGas technicians/ fitters measure the length of bolts from \nunderneath the head to the end in most cases and from end to \nend in bolts with countersunk heads.\nThreaded Rod\nPurpose\nOften, the use of a m anufactured bolt is not realistic \nbecause the correct length is not available, and adjustm ents \nare lim ited. In such cases, you can use a threaded rod and \ncut it to the required length.\nTypes\n•\nSteel rod with threaded ends\n•\nAll- threaded rod\nApplications\nCom m only used for custom  length fastening solutions in \ngas installations.\nAnchoring Fasteners\nPurpose\nVarious devices help fasten \nhangers and supports to \nconcrete walls and ceilings.\nMaterials\nThey m ay be iron, lead, or plastic.\nApplications\nEssential for securing gas \nequipm ent to concrete \nstructures.\nInsert Anchors and Shields\nInsert Anchors\nGas technicians/ fitters use insert anchors with m achine \nbolts or lag screws. They insert the anchor into the hole and \ntighten the fastener into the shield.\nLead and Plastic Shields\nAlso known as rawl plugs, these are used with m achine bolts \nor lag screws. They require the drilling of a correctly sized \nhole into the surface.\nDrop- in Anchors\nRequire a special tool or pin to set the anchor. The tool m ust \nbe the appropriate size for the anchor, i.e., a 3/ 8 tool for a \n3/ 8 anchor, and should not have a \"m ushroom ed\" end.\nToggle Bolts\nPurpose\nHelp fix hangers to surfaces with hollow \nspaces behind them\nMechanism\nTightening causes bracing against back \nwall surface\nTypes\nSpring wing, tumble, and riveted tumble\nToggle bolts help fix hangers to surfaces with hollow spaces behind them. The action of correctly tightening the toggle bolt causes a \nbracing mechanism to act against the back wall surface.\nHose Clam ps\nFigure 1- 8 Gear type hose clam p (m anual tightening)\nFigure 1- 9 Hose clam p (self- tightening)\nPurpose\nGas technicians/ fitters use a hose clam p \nto attach a hose to a pipe, pum p, or \nother device.\nTypes\nHose clam ps can be of the self-\ntightening type (spring loaded) or of the \ntype requiring m anual tightening.\nIm portant Note\nGenerally speaking, hose clam ps are not \napproved for use with a hose that carries \neither natural gas or propane.\nPipe Fasteners Introduction\nIm portance\nThe installation of piping system s is \nan integral part of the gas trade.\nPre- Installation \nConsiderations\nBefore installation, it is im portant to \nconsider how, where, and how often \nyou m ust support (or fasten) a \npiping system  from  (or to) the \nstructure.\nVariety\nThe pipe supports and fasteners are \nnum erous.

Explain the difference between National Fine (NF) and National Coarse (NC) thread types, and when you might use threaded rod.\nPART C: CASE STUDY SCENARIOS (2 scenarios)\nScenario 1: You need to install a gas pipe hanger system for a horizontal natural gas line running along a concrete ceiling in a basement. The pipe is 2-inch steel and will be approximately 15 feet long between supports. You have access to various fasteners including toggle bolts, insert anchors, lag bolts, and different types of hangers.\n11. Describe your fastener selection process for this installation. Include: (a) what type of anchoring system you would use for the concrete ceiling, (b) what type of hanger would be most appropriate, and (c) what factors you need to consider for proper spacing and support.\nScenario 2: During a service call, you discover that a flexible gas connector hose has become loose at its connection point to a gas appliance. You notice that the original hose clamp appears to be a basic gear-type clamp that may not be providing adequate securing force. The hose carries natural gas and the connection must be both secure and safe.\n12. Explain the steps you would take to properly secure this connection. Include: (a) safety precautions you must take before working on the connection, (b) what type of fastening system would be most appropriate for this gas application, (c) any restrictions or considerations specific to natural gas hose connections mentioned in the chapter.\nANSWER KEY\nPART A: MULTIPLE CHOICE\na) Wood, concrete, steel\nc) Flat head machine screw\nb) Lag bolts are heavy screws that help fasten brackets to wooden members\nc) Insert anchors and lead shields (rawl plugs)\nb) To provide support for vertical and horizontal pipe installations\nc) Hose clamp\nc) Black steel\nb) A bracing mechanism acts against the back wall surface\nPART B: SHORT ANSWER\n9. Four factors to consider when fastening piping or equipment: a) Type of material to which you must fasten the piping or equipment b) Type of equipment that you are fastening c) Weight and shape of the equipment d) Whether the equipment has support from above or below (Also acceptable: whether expansion or vibration is a factor; the number of fasteners or supports required)\n10. National Fine vs National Coarse threads: National Fine (NF) threads have more threads per inch and provide finer adjustment and stronger holding power in thinner materials. National Coarse (NC) threads have fewer threads per inch and are easier to assemble/disassemble. Threaded rod is used when the correct bolt length is not available and adjustments are limited - you can cut threaded rod to the required length for custom applications.\nPART C: CASE STUDIES\n11. Gas pipe hanger installation on concrete ceiling: (a) Anchoring system: Use insert anchors (rawl plugs) for the concrete ceiling, as they require drilling correctly sized holes and provide secure attachment to masonry materials. (b) Hanger type: Use adjustable steel ring hangers or clevis hangers, as they can accommodate the 2-inch pipe size and provide proper support. Clevis hangers are typically black steel and suitable for gas piping. (c) Factors to consider: Proper spacing based on pipe size and weight (typically every 6-10 feet for 2-inch steel pipe), ensure adequate load-bearing capacity for the total weight, consider thermal expansion of the pipe, select correct size fasteners for the expected load, and ensure the hangers allow for any potential vibration.\n12. Loose gas hose connection repair: (a) Safety precautions: Turn off gas supply at the appliance shutoff valve and at the meter if necessary, ensure adequate ventilation, check for gas leaks using approved leak detection solution (never use open flame), and follow lockout/tagout procedures. (b) Appropriate fastening system: Replace with a proper gear-type hose clamp designed for gas applications, ensuring it provides adequate clamping force. The clamp should be sized correctly for the hose diameter and connection. (c) Gas-specific considerations: The chapter notes that hose clamps are generally not approved for use with hoses that carry either natural gas or propane, so this connection may require a different approved connector or replacement of the entire flexible connector with an approved gas connector system. Always verify local codes and manufacturer specifications for gas appliance connections.",

Case Study: Tool Selection\nYou are working on a gas line installation in a tight crawl space. You need to connect a 1-inch NPT fitting, but you only have limited space to maneuver. The fitting requires significant torque to properly tighten.\na) Which type of wrench would be most appropriate for this situation and why?\nb) What safety considerations should you keep in mind when working in this confined space?\n15. Case Study: Threading Operation\nA junior technician is about to cut external threads on a 3/4-inch steel pipe. He has selected a receding die but hasn't prepared any threading oil. He's also planning to cut the pipe with a hacksaw first.\na) Identify at least three problems with this approach:\nb) What would you recommend as the correct procedure?\nAnswer Key\nMultiple Choice Answers:\nd) All of the above\nb) To enable the gas technician/fitter to choose the correct tool for the correct job\nd) Tri-wing\nc) 4 inches (100 mm)\nb) Open-ended wrench\nb) 6 or 12\nb) NPS 3/4 to NPS 5\nd) Diamond point chisel\nc) 3/4 inch\nb) Single-wheel cutter (wheel-and-roller cutter)\nShort Answer Answers:\n11. Three factors for tool selection:\nDesign features/type of work\nWork space available\nMaterials being worked on\nSize(s) of parts\nTypes of fasteners used\nForce limitations\nSafety considerations\nSpeed and efficiency requirements (Accept any 3 reasonable answers from the content)\n12. Why not to use snips on wire: Snips should not be used to cut wire because it can nick/damage the blades of the snips. This can ruin the cutting edges and make the snips ineffective for their intended purpose of cutting sheet metal, duct work, and similar materials.\n13. Thread cutting oil ingredients:\nFatty oil - Provide an even film\nSulphur/chlorine - Supply a tough chemical film between cutting edges and threaded material\nAnti-foam agent - Reduce surface tension and foam buildup\nGermicide - Lessen the risk of infection should the operator be injured (Accept any 3 of the 4 listed)\nCase Study Answers:\n14a. Tool selection for tight space: A box wrench or heavy-duty offset pipe wrench would be most appropriate. The box wrench provides better grip and requires less swing space than an open-ended wrench, while still providing the torque needed. An offset pipe wrench allows access in tight quarters while providing the high torque capability needed for pipe fittings.\n14b. Safety considerations:\nEnsure adequate ventilation in confined space\nUse proper body positioning to avoid strain\nKeep tools organized to prevent losing them in tight space\nBe aware of gas line locations to avoid damage\nHave proper lighting\nConsider having someone nearby for safety\n15a. Problems identified:\nUsing hacksaw instead of pipe cutter - will not provide square, clean cut needed for proper threading\nNo threading oil - will result in poor thread quality, potential tool damage, and difficult operation\nUsing receding die for this application - receding dies are typically for larger pipes with considerable surface area\n15b. Correct procedure:\nUse proper pipe cutter to ensure square, clean cut\nPrepare threading oil before starting\nUse appropriate die type (likely full-width die for 3/4\" pipe)\nReam the cut end to remove burr\nApply threading oil during the threading operation\nThread carefully to avoid cross-threading",

Case Study: Tool Selection \nYou are working on a gas line installation in a tight crawl space. You need to connect a 1-inch \nNPT fitting, but you only have limited space to maneuver. The fitting requires significant torque \nto properly tighten. \na) Which type of wrench would be most appropriate for this situation and why? \n \n \nb) What safety considerations should you keep in mind when working in this confined space? \n \n \n15. Case Study: Threading Operation \nA junior technician is about to cut external threads on a 3/4-inch steel pipe. He has selected a \nreceding die but hasn't prepared any threading oil. He's also planning to cut the pipe with a \nhacksaw first. \na) Identify at least three problems with this approach: \n1. \n \n2. \n \n3.\nb) What would you recommend as the correct procedure?\nAnswer Key \nMultiple Choice Answers: \n1. d) All of the above \n2. b) To enable the gas technician/fitter to choose the correct tool for the correct job \n3. d) Tri-wing \n4. c) 4 inches (100 mm) \n5. b) Open-ended wrench \n6. b) 6 or 12 \n7. b) NPS 3/4 to NPS 5 \n8. d) Diamond point chisel \n9. c) 3/4 inch \n10. b) Single-wheel cutter (wheel-and-roller cutter) \nShort Answer Answers: \n11. Three factors for tool selection: \n• \nDesign features/type of work \n• \nWork space available \n• \nMaterials being worked on \n• \nSize(s) of parts \n• \nTypes of fasteners used \n• \nForce limitations \n• \nSafety considerations \n• \nSpeed and efficiency requirements (Accept any 3 reasonable answers from the content) \n12. Why not to use snips on wire: Snips should not be used to cut wire because it can \nnick/damage the blades of the snips. This can ruin the cutting edges and make the snips \nineffective for their intended purpose of cutting sheet metal, duct work, and similar materials. \n13. Thread cutting oil ingredients: \n1. Fatty oil - Provide an even film \n2. Sulphur/chlorine - Supply a tough chemical film between cutting edges and threaded \nmaterial \n3. Anti-foam agent - Reduce surface tension and foam buildup \n4. Germicide - Lessen the risk of infection should the operator be injured (Accept any 3 of \nthe 4 listed) \nCase Study Answers: \n14a. Tool selection for tight space: A box wrench or heavy-duty offset pipe wrench would be \nmost appropriate. The box wrench provides better grip and requires less swing space than an\nopen-ended wrench, while still providing the torque needed. An offset pipe wrench allows access \nin tight quarters while providing the high torque capability needed for pipe fittings. \n14b. Safety considerations: \n• \nEnsure adequate ventilation in confined space \n• \nUse proper body positioning to avoid strain \n• \nKeep tools organized to prevent losing them in tight space \n• \nBe aware of gas line locations to avoid damage \n• \nHave proper lighting \n• \nConsider having someone nearby for safety \n15a. Problems identified: \n1. Using hacksaw instead of pipe cutter - will not provide square, clean cut needed for \nproper threading \n2. No threading oil - will result in poor thread quality, potential tool damage, and difficult \noperation \n3. Using receding die for this application - receding dies are typically for larger pipes with \nconsiderable surface area \n15b. Correct procedure: \n1. Use proper pipe cutter to ensure square, clean cut \n2. Prepare threading oil before starting \n3. Use appropriate die type (likely full-width die for 3/4\" pipe) \n4. Ream the cut end to remove burr \n5. Apply threading oil during the threading operation \n6. Thread carefully to avoid cross-threading",

SCENARIO: You need to measure the diameter of a cylindrical gas pipe that will be 4 feet long. The pipe has a radius of 3 inches. You need to calculate both the circumference and the volume of this pipe. Show your calculations.\nCircumference calculation:\nCircumference: _________________ inches\nVolume calculation:\nVolume: _________________ cubic inches\nANSWER KEY\nMultiple Choice Answers:\nb) Fuel, oxygen, and heat\nb) To check air quality and ensure safe, efficient operation\nc) Tube analyzers\nb) Pound per square inch\nc) Continuous sampling electronic analyzers\nb) They can test many samples without changing chemicals\nd) Water column manometer\nc) Compound gauge\nShort Answer Answers:\n9. Three main types of flue gas analyzers:\nContinuous sampling (electronic) analyzers\nTube analyzers (such as Draeger and Gastec)\nLiquid analyzers (selective chemical absorption)\n10. Combustion process explanation: Combustion is the rapid oxidation of any material classified as combustible matter. It is a rapid chemical reaction where oxygen from air combines with the combustible elements of fuel (normally carbon and hydrogen) to release heat energy.\nCase Scenario Answers:\n11. Gastec Detector Tube Procedure: Step 1: Break off the tapered tube ends and connect one opened end to the Gastec sampling pump. Step 2: Pull the hand-operated vacuum pump handle to draw the flue gas sample through the tube. Step 3: As the sample moves through the tube, the test gas reacts immediately with the dry chemical and causes it to discolor, beginning at the entry end of the detector tube. Step 4: Measure the gas concentration at the point where the coloration stops using the graduated markings on the side of the tube.\n12. Manometer Pressure Calculation: Calculation: 6 inches H₂O ÷ 27.7 inches H₂O per PSI = 0.217 PSI\nGas Pressure: 0.217 PSI\nSystem Analysis: This relatively low pressure reading indicates the system is operating within normal parameters for residential gas appliances, which typically operate at pressures between 3.5\" to 14\" W.C. (0.13 to 0.51 PSI). This measurement would be suitable for natural gas appliance operation.",
