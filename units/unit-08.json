          "content": "Steel piping and tubing fittings\n\nSteel pipe fittings must be of malleable iron or steel construction and be approved for use with gas systems.\n\nSteel pipe fittings consist of\n• 45° and 90° elbows;\n• straight and reducing couplings;\n• nipples and unions;\n• bushings;\n• normal and reducing tees; and\n• plugs and caps.\n\nFigure 1-14 shows several types of steel fittings commonly used for gas systems.\n\nProhibited fittings\nYou cannot use some types of fittings with gas systems.\n\nThese include\n• fittings with running threads (such as thread protectors);\n• street elbow and tee fittings;\n• close nipples; and\n• fittings with right-hand and left-hand threads.\n\nGas valves\n\nGas valves control the flow of gas to different appliances, as well as to main and pilot burners at various points along a piping system. With different valves, a gas technician/fitter can make a complete shutdown or regulate the flow at specific locations.\n\nCSA B149.1 outlines specific locations and applications for installing manual gas valves. A gas technician/fitter must take care to select the right valve for the job, because valve size, gas pressure, and location are all important factors. In addition, you must ensure that valves can be removed for repair or replacement.\n\nManual gas shut-off valves\n\nManual gas valves are incorporated into a piping system in different ways. In most cases, the valve size dictates the jointing method used. The larger valves are usually flanged in place; the mid-range sizes are threaded; and the smaller sizes, when used with copper tubing, are connected using flare fittings.\n\nClause 6.18 of CSA B149.1 outlines the code requirements for manual gas shut-off valves.\n\nManual gas shut-off valves fall into the following three categories:\n1) Plug type\n2) Ball type\n3) Eccentric type\n\nPlug type\nPlug-type valves open fully (and close fully) with a quarter turn of the handle.\n\nThere are two basic types that are common to the gas industry:\n- Spring-loaded valve: Made of brass and approved only for indoor use with sizes reaching up to 1-in diameter\n- Lubricated plug valve: Made of malleable iron and approved for indoor or outdoor use. Commonly named Lubeseal. Designed to be lubricated and maintained with the valve in place (ensuring no interruption of service)\n\nEccentric valve\nAnother type of plug valve is the rotating-eccentric valve. A rotating-eccentric valve has a spherically faced plug that rotates approximately 50° from a fully open to fully closed position — the eccentric motion reducing operating torque requirements. You can achieve a tight shut-off with this type of valve because it produces no sliding friction between the plug and seat (the absence of which reduces seat wear and seating torque).\n\nBall type\nBall-type valves also open and close with a quarter turn of the handle and are also approved for indoor or outdoor use.\n\nBall-type valves have a Teflon seat and a stainless-steel sealing ball. To control the flow, the ball has a hole drilled through its centre and fits, in the closed position, tightly against the Teflon seat. With this type of valve, lubrication is not a concern.\n\nNeedle type\nNeedle valves are used for smaller applications and internal valve control. Needle valves are simple flow restrictors, which are usually opened or closed using a screwdriver. When slightly unscrewed, the flow is limited; full flow occurs when the needle is unscrewed to its fullest extent.\n\nMaster shut-off valves\nClause 6.18 of CSA B149.1 contains Code requirements for master shut-off valves. According to the Code, when multiple outlets are installed in a classroom, laboratory (or similar facility) they must be able to be controlled via an easy-to-identify master shut-off valve in a readily accessible location.",

          "content": "Overview\n\nPurpose\nA gas technician/fitter must know how to interpret codes to properly test gas piping systems and gas-fired appliances and equipment to ensure that they are able to operate safely and efficiently.\n\nObjectives\nAt the end of this Chapter, you will be able to\n• interpret codes as they apply to testing piping systems; and\n• describe how to document test results on the test tag.\n\nTerminology\n- Pressure test tag: A tag attached to a system in a prominent place after testing that includes location, testing, and tester information\n\nCodes as they apply to testing piping systems\n\nTesting requirements for gas piping systems\nAfter installing a gas piping system, it must be pressure tested in accordance with the requirements outlined in the applicable codes and regulations. Inspect and test all piping and components that are going to be concealed (before they are concealed).\n\nPerform testing at these two specific times:\n• Before the installation of any appliances (CSA B149.1, Clause 6.22.2); and\n• After the installation of appliances (CSA B149.1, Clause 6.22.3)\n\nPressure test device calibration requirements\nFor systems where the working pressure exceeds 0.5 psig (3.5 kPa) but does not exceed 5 psig (35 kPa), the pressure gauge or equivalent device shall undergo calibration to read in increments of not greater than 2 in w.c. (0.5 kPa).\n\nFor systems where the working pressure exceeds 5 psig (35 kPa), the pressure gauge or equivalent device shall undergo calibration to read in increments of not greater than either 2 psig (14 kPa) or 2% of the maximum dial reading of the gauge, whichever is less.\n\nWhen using a pressure gauge, it must be a minimum of 3 in (75 mm) in diameter, and the maximum range must exceed the test pressure by at least 15% but not more than 300%.\n\nVisual inspection\nDuring the installation of piping and tubing and before pressure testing, visually inspect piping and tubing for cuts, abrasions, and any other possible defects that could cause the leaking or failure of the system when it is under pressure.\n\nRemember: Inspect and test all piping and components that are going to be concealed (before they are concealed).\n\nTesting before the installation of appliances\nPerform the first system test after the installation of the piping system, before the connection of any appliances to the system. Before testing, isolate or remove any components of the system that have a pressure rating below the test pressure to prevent any damage to these components.\n\nTo perform the test, follow these steps:\n1) Isolate the piping system for testing by capping or plugging all open ends.\n2) Insert a pressure gauge at one end of the system.\n3) Pressurize the system with air or inert gas (nitrogen or carbon dioxide) to the specified test pressure. Figure 2-1 (Table 6.3 of CSA B149.1) shows the pressure test requirements for gas piping and tubing systems.\n4) Measure the pressure with a pressure gauge calibrated in 14 kPa (2 psig) increments or less, or 2% of the full-scale reading of the gauge, whichever is greater.\n\nLeak detection\nIf a pressure drop in the system indicates a leak, do a \"soap test\" to locate the leak source.\n1) Apply leak detector solution to each joint or fitting in the suspect portion of the system.\n2) A leak will cause the solution to bubble, indicating the source of the leak.\n\nTesting after the installation of appliances\nAfter the appliances are installed, visually check the system to ensure that there are no openings in the system from which gas can escape. Calibrate the manometer or pressure gauge used for this test in 1 in w.c. (250 kPa) increments or less.\n\nPerform the pressure test as follows:\n1) Shut off the appliances and install a manometer or pressure gauge at the gas meter outlet.\n2) Introduce gas into the system, listen for the gas flow to stop, and monitor the gas meter test dial to ensure that no gas is escaping.\n3) Turn off the meter valve. The system contains the gas under pressure.\n4) Maintain the gas pressure indicated on the manometer or pressure test gauge for a minimum of 10 min. If the manometer or pressure gauge indicates that there is a leak, refer to the earlier section of this Chapter, \"Testing before the installation of appliances\".\n5) Upon successfully completing the test, perform a leak test on all untested control valves and appliance piping (under normal operating pressure) using a leak detection solution to ensure that they are gas tight.\n\nChecking for shut-off valve seepage\nPerform a shut-off valve seepage test (or \"bubble test\") to ensure that gas seepage from the meter valve is not masking any undetected gas leaks. (A gas meter valve might sometimes seep gas if its sealing grease becomes hard and dry.) If the valve passes gas in this way, the system test is not accurate, and the results are invalid. For this reason, before performing the pressure test, check the gas meter valve for seepage by doing the following:\n1) When the system is brought to a static pressure condition, release a small amount of the contained gas pressure by quickly removing then replacing the manometer or pressure gauge tubing.\n2) This action opens the service regulator, allowing the testing of the system back to the gas meter shut-off valve.\n3) If, after this action, the gas pressure increases slowly to static pressure, the meter valve is seeping gas and should undergo servicing before testing proceeds.\n\nPropane system testing\nPropane system testing has two stages.\n\nBefore the installation of appliances\nPropane follows the same procedure as natural gas. (Refer to the earlier section in this Chapter, \"Testing before the installation of appliances\".)\n\nAfter the installation of appliances\nIf a meter is installed on a propane system, this test follows the same procedure as the test for natural gas. (Refer to the earlier section in this Chapter, \"Testing after the installation of appliances\").\n\nIf no meter is installed, follow these steps:\n1) Do a main manual shut-off valve seepage test. (Refer to the earlier section in this Chapter, \"Checking for shut-off valve seepage\".)\n2) Place a pressure gauge on the system. (Refer to CSA B149.1 for pressure gauge requirements.)\n3) If it is a two-stage system, do the following:\n   a) Place another pressure gauge on the second stage. (You can use a manometer in place of a pressure gauge on low-pressure systems.)\n   b) Perform a seepage test on the manual shut-off valve at the second-stage regulator.\n4) Pressurize the system by opening the manual valves on each stage.\n5) When the system is up to pressure, close the manual valves.\n6) Mark the pressure gauges and observe for leakage.\n\nLeak detection\nIf a pressure drop in the system indicates a leak, do a \"soap test\" to locate its source.\n• Apply leak detector solution to each joint or fitting in the suspect portion of the system.\n• A leak will cause the solution to bubble at its source.\n\nDocumenting test results on a test tag\n\nDocumenting test results\nIn some jurisdictions, a gas technician/fitter is required to attach a test tag to the system in a prominent location after completing a test on a natural gas or propane system.\n\nThe test tag must contain the following information:\n• Address of the test\n• Contractor's name\n• Contractor's registration number\n• Date of the test\n• Test pressure\n• Test duration\n• Total pipe length\n• Pipe size\n• Fitter's name\n• Fitter's certificate number and classification\n• The statement \"Do not remove.\"",

          "content": "Overview\n\nPurpose\nA gas technician/fitter must know how to properly purge a gas piping system in accordance with applicable codes to prevent a buildup of combustible air/gas mixtures and to ensure that the piping/tubing system delivers air-free gas to appliances.\n\nObjectives\nAt the end of this Chapter, you will be able to\n• refer to Code requirements related to purging;\n• identify the locations for purge points; and\n• describe the differences in purging natural gas and propane.\n\nTerminology\n- Branch line: A part of a piping or tubing system that conveys gas from the main piping or tubing or header to an appliance\n- Purge: The replacement of the existing fluid (gaseous or liquid) in piping, tubing, equipment, a container, or an appliance with another (desired) fluid\n- Purge burner: A burner equipped with a constant ignition source and flame arrestor intended to burn the escaping (discharged) gas during purging operations\n- Specific gravity: The ratio of the density of gas to the density of air at a specified temperature and pressure\n\nPurging requirements and locations for purge points\n\nAfter successfully completing pressure and leak tests, you must purge the gas system. Purging involves forcing air out of the system with gas under pressure. It is important to begin purging at the proper location and to continue purging at specified locations to ensure that the complete system is purged.\n\nClause 6.23 of CSA B149.1 covers purging requirements and procedures.\n\nIncorrect purging methods and shortcuts have led to leaks, fires, and even explosions. It is imperative that gas technicians/fitters purge in accordance with safe, approved methods.\n\nPurge points and procedures\nPurging should start at the appliance farthest from the supply source. Purging of branch lines then follows one by one at a location farthest from the point where the gas enters the individual branch line.\n\nClause 6.23 of CSA B149.1 lists several options for purging natural gas and propane piping and tubing systems. You should review this information to ensure that you use the most suitable method for the type of installation you are dealing with.\n\nIt is worth noting again that incorrect purging procedures have led to gas leaks, fires, and, in rare cases, explosions.\n\nThe following methods are acceptable and code-recognized procedures for purging:\n- Use of a hose to the outdoors: Use a long hose that terminates outside (away from air intakes and sources of ignition) and has a quarter-turn valve. Position another gas technician/fitter at the outside location.\n- Use of a burner: Use a specially approved burner that connects to piping and has a propane-fired pilot light that flares off the gas/air mixture until a stable flame is established.\n- Use of pilot tubing: On appliances equipped with a constant pilot, you can disconnect the tubing at the gas valve and purge it using the gas control valve knob. The input of the appliance must be less than 400 000 Btu.\n- Use of a readily accessible burner: When an installation includes a gas range, you may purge the system piping at the top range burners with a match lit beside them until a steady flame is established. The appliance's input must be less than 400 000 Btu.\n- Use of a purge tool: Annex H outlines the use of this approved assembly, which connects to the drip pocket and allows for purging indoors using the spring-loaded nozzle valve.\n\nClause 6.23 of CSA B149.1 (which also references Annex H in the Code) lists purging requirements and procedures. Gas technicians/fitters should review and become familiar with these code requirements.\n\nDifferences between purging natural gas and propane\n\nWith respect to purging, the main differences to be aware with natural gas and propane are their different upper and lower explosive limits and their different specific gravities.\n\nUpper and lower explosive limits (limits of flammability)\nBoth natural gas and propane will explode if mixed with a certain volume of air and ignited.\n\nGas - Approximate explosive limits (flammability limits)\n- Natural gas: Ranges from 4 to 15% natural gas in air\n- Propane: Ranges from 2 to 9.5% propane in air\n\nExplosion risk\nImportant: Concentrations above these limits potentially increase the risk of explosion; concentrations below these limits lessen the risk of explosion.",

          "content": "Overview\n\nPurpose\nCorrosion can quickly destroy a piping system, so measures must be taken to control and prevent it. This Chapter explains why corrosion protection is important and what a gas technician/fitter must do to ensure that piping is properly protected.\n\nObjectives\nAt the end of this Chapter, you will be able to\n• describe the corrosion process;\n• describe the reasons for corrosion protection; and\n• describe corrosion protection methods.\n\nTerminology\n- Grounding: A specific form of bonding involving the connection of one or more conductive objects to the ground by means of a conductor, such as a wire or rod\n- Resistivity: The resistance of an electrolyte to electric force within a cube measuring 1 cm3\n\nReasons for corrosion protection\n\nCorrosion\nCorrosion is one of the ways that a pure metal can revert to a more stable compound. Some metals, when unprotected from the atmosphere, gradually corrode.\n\nThe metals used to make pipelines and piping systems are generally pure. However, you can also find metals as chemical compounds, such as oxides, sulphides, and other salts.\n\nMany metals are more stable in their natural compound form than as pure metals. For example, iron oxide (rust) is more stable than pure iron used in pipes because, after the atmosphere has reacted with the iron and created the compound iron oxide, it will have no further chemical reaction to atmospheric elements and has become, therefore, stable.\n\nCauses of corrosion\nCorrosive materials and conditions that can have adverse effects on gas piping and tubing include the following:\n• Atmospheric and soil conditions;\n• Chemicals;\n• Cement;\n• Cinders and fly ash; and\n• Electrolytic action.\n\nCorrosion protection and control\nCorrosion protection and control is a highly specialized field. A qualified corrosion engineer or a firm specializing in this work should always supervise the design, installation, and testing of piping protection systems. (You can obtain a current list of corrosion specialists from your local gas authority.) Nevertheless, as a gas technician/fitter, you must fully understand the corrosion process so that you can take preventive measures when installing or repairing piping that may be exposed to corrosive conditions.\n\nGas system piping and tubing installed in locations where it may be exposed to corrosion must have protection. Protection can be provided in numerous ways — depending on the material to protect and the nature of the exposure to corrosion.\n\nThe corrosion process\n\nCorrosion is an electrochemical action that changes pure metals into their compounds while producing electric current.\n\nThese four things are necessary for corrosion to occur:\n• an anode;\n• a cathode;\n• an electrolyte; and\n• a conductive path.\n\nCorrosion cannot occur if any of these are absent.\n\nAnode and cathode\nMetal corrodes when there is a complete electrical circuit, as the electrical current travels from the anode to the cathode in the electrolyte. This conventional current, which is the movement of positive charges, can be found in a basic electrical circuit. The anode and cathode are called electrodes.\n\nAn everyday example of how we directly benefit from this electrochemical action is the dry cell battery, which produces an electric current because the zinc casing is an anode and the carbon rod is a cathode. The electric current runs from the anode to the cathode, passes through the light, and goes back to the anode.\n\nElectrolyte\nDry metals, in general, do not corrode because water is essential to the corrosion process, because it is water that is the electrolyte conducting the electric current.\n\nAlthough pure water is a poor electrical conductor, traces of salts, acids, and alkalis within it increase its effectiveness as an electrolyte and greatly accelerate the processes of corrosion. Water and these contaminants are present in most soils and, with oxygen permeating the soil from the air above, all the agents of corrosion are present.\n\nSoils have varying abilities to resist current flow and, therefore, have varying abilities as electrolytes. For example, a soil with very high resistance to electrical current (dry soil or gravel) is a poor electrolyte, while a moist soil with low resistance to electric current (loam or clay) is a better electrolyte. Therefore, piping that is buried in moist soil is more prone to corrosion than piping buried in dry soil.\n\nMetallic path\nIn an unprotected underground pipe, the electric current flows from the anodic areas of the pipe, through the (electrolyte) soil to the cathodic areas of the pipe. The current then returns through the pipe and completes the circuit. The metallic path is the pipe length the electrical current is travelling from the time it enters the cathode until it leaves the anode.\n\nMetals with different potentials\nAll metals have a known electrical value on an electromotive scale. If two metals have different electrical potentials, a current will flow between them with the current always flowing from active metals (with higher potential) to less active metals (with lower potential).\n\nCurrent flows between metals of differing potential regardless of whether they are close together or far apart. Surface corrosion occurs when the metals are close together, for example, when there is mill scale on steel piping.\n\nAlso, however, when the characteristics of the soil change from one end of a pipeline to the other, the soil's resistivity may change the metal's potential which, again, creates current flow and corrosion.\n\nResistivity\n\"Resistivity\" refers to the electrolyte's (here, soil) resistance to electric force within a cube measuring 1 cm3. Resistivity is expressed in ohm/cm.\n\nNearly all soils are corrosive to steel, but those below 10 000 ohms/cm are considered especially corrosive. Soils below 5000 ohms/cm are sufficiently corrosive to cast iron or ductile iron to warrant cathodic protection. Sharp changes in soil resistivity over a pipeline route can also cause severe corrosion problems.\n\nThe Wenner four-pin method is the technique that is usually used to measure resistivity. The Wenner four-pin method involves driving four pins into the ground in a straight line at specific distances apart, the imposition of a current between the two outside pins, and the measurement of the voltage across the two inside pins. These readings are used to calculate resistivity.\n\nCorrosion protection methods\n\nIn general, piping and tubing are\n• covered with an approved corrosion-resistant paint or coating when conditions require; and\n• coated or wrapped at locations where it passes through walls where it can sustain physical damage or be subject to corrosion.\n\nDifferent types of pipes and tubing require different treatment.\n\nCopper pipe and tubing\nCopper pipe and tubing must be protected from corrosion in situations where:\n- Aboveground: When copper passes through certain material (concrete, a cement block, or similar) that would cause corrosion if the copper came in direct contact with this material. When the copper could contact a dissimilar metal. When copper could come into contact with corrosive chemicals or vapours.\n- Underground: If using Type L or G copper, all underground copper tubing installations require the use of an approved protective coating. Use of Type K copper is allowed (this type does not require external protection).\n\nSteel and iron pipes\nSteel and iron pipes must be protected from corrosion in situations where:\n- Aboveground: When the steel or iron passes through certain material (concrete, a cement block, or similar) that would cause corrosion if the steel or iron came in direct contact with this materials. When the steel or iron pipe could contact a dissimilar metal. When the pipe could come into contact with corrosive chemicals or vapours.\n- Underground: Installations require protection for steel and iron pipe by means of an approved method or a combination of methods, such as protective coating, corrosion-resistant wrapping, cathodic protection, electrical bonding, and isolation of individual pipe sections.\n\nPlastic pipes\nYou may only use polyethylene (plastic) pipes for underground installations. (The material of all risers extending above grade must be steel or copper.) Connectors must be approved transition fittings, and a tracer wire must follow the pipe in case the pipe needs to be located in the future.\n\nMethods for protecting underground piping\nThere are three methods for protecting underground piping from corrosion:\n• protective coatings;\n• electrical insulation; and\n• cathodic protection.\n\nProtective coatings\nProtective coatings insulate a pipe from the soil (here, the electrolyte). A good coating has a high dielectric strength (i.e., it is a good electrical insulator), adheres tightly to the pipe, and has the necessary mechanical strength to withstand handling, soil stresses, and any tendency toward cracking.\n\nThe main coatings used are yard-applied coal tar and extruded polyethylene. While most coatings absorb some water and allow some current to penetrate through the steel surface, for most practical purposes, the steel is considered to be isolated from the soil.\n\nRepairing a pipe that has a protective coating\nWhen repairing or joining a pipe with a protective coating, ensure you use approved protective coatings like Polyken tape or heat-shrink sleeves.\n\nWhen repairing the pipe, check the quality of the protective coating using the \"jeep test\" (also known as the \"holiday detector test\") — an electronic testing unit that will find imperfections in the coating for you to repair them before you bury the piping.\n\nEnsure that a protected piping system is electrically insulated from other metallic structures by installing a dielectric fitting on the pipeline directly outside the building wall. The fitting prevents electrical contact between protected piping (underground) and unprotected piping (aboveground). It is usually an insulated union, insulated flange, or insulated meter spud.\n\nIn addition, insulated couplings separate long gas piping networks into individual electrical units. In this way, long electric current lines are inhibited, and you can accurately assess the number of anodes required for each unit.\n\nBonding of piping\nCSA B149.1, Clause 4.7.3, requires that all building metal gas piping that may become energized shall be made electrically continuous and shall be bonded in accordance with the requirements of the local electrical code or, in the absence of such, CSA C22.1.\n\nCSA B149.1 forbids the use of gas piping as an electrical ground, while CSA C22.1 requires bonding of continuous metal gas piping systems in a building supplied with electric power. Note that bonding and grounding are not the same.\n\nBonding, as defined in CSA C22.1, is \"a low impedance path obtained by permanently joining all non-current-carrying metal parts to ensure electrical continuity and having the capacity to conduct safely any current likely to be imposed on it.\"\n\nGrounding, as defined in CSA C22.1, is \"a permanent and continuous conductive path to the earth with sufficient ampacity to carry any fault current liable to be imposed on it, and of a sufficiently low impedance to limit the voltage rise above ground and to facilitate the operation of the protective devices in the circuit.\"\n\nThus, code-compliant bonding of gas piping in the field ensures that the gas piping is made equipotential with the non-current-carrying conductive parts of electrical equipment.\n\nAlso note that the requirement in Rule 10-700 c) of CSA C22.1 to provide equipotential bonding to a metal gas piping system is not intended to apply to metal gas tubing, i.e., CSST. Attempts to bond metal gas tubing with conventional bonding means can create a hazardous situation where the tubing can be punctured by the installation of the bonding means or by arcing between improperly secured bonding means during faults or lightning strikes.\n\nThe grounding conductor at a building connects to a grounding electrode, and both CSA B149.1 and CSA C22.1 require the installation of the bonding of the gas piping to that system in an approved manner. This bonding connection provides equipotentiality — the state in which conductive parts are at a substantially equal electric potential.",

          "content": "Overview\n\nPurpose\nA gas technician/fitter may be required to perform various duties related to the installation and repair of water heaters, boilers, and pool heaters. These duties may include tasks that involve the piping and tubing systems that supply water to gas- fired appliances. This Chapter outlines the standards, regulations, codes, and application requirements for water distribution piping.\n\nObjectives\nAt the end of this Chapter, you will be able to\n• identify standards, regulations, and codes for water distribution piping;\n• identify the types of piping used in water distribution; and\n• describe the methods used to join these materials.\n\nTerminology\n- Water distribution piping: In relation to potable water systems, used to identify piping downstream of the main shut-off (control) valve, usually at the water meter\n\nPiping and tubing\n\nThe three most common materials used for water distribution piping are\n• copper;\n• galvanized steel (however, most codes no longer permit this within potable systems); and\n• plastic.\n\nThere are other piping materials, such as cast iron, that are approved for water distribution, but they are used in situations that are beyond the normal scope of work for a gas technician/fitter.\n\nCodes and standards\nYou can find design standards for water service piping in the applicable plumbing code. (These standards are printed or stamped on the exterior wall of the tube or pipe.)\n\nConsult local codes for items such as water supply shut-off vacuum relief, temperature or pressure relief (or both), and cross-connection control requirements. Also note that the installation of plastic piping and tubing must be done in accordance with building code regulations concerning combustible piping, fire separations, etc.\n\nRegulations\nMost provincial regulations require a licensed plumber or steamfitter to perform any work beyond the immediate piping attached to a boiler or water heater. Since the scope of work of a gas technician/fitter does not include any work beyond that considered essential to the operation of the appliance, refusal to adhere to local regulations may invalidate manufacturer warranties and insurance company coverage. (Furthermore, working beyond the scope of your licensing coverage can carry liability as per your local AHJ.)\n\nCopper tubing\nThere are three types of copper tubes used for water distribution. The table below lists them in descending order, according to wall thickness.\n\nType - Colour code - Available in\n- Type K copper: Green - Coils (soft copper), Rigid lengths (hard copper)\n- Type L copper: Blue - Coils (soft copper), Rigid lengths (hard copper)\n- Type M copper: Red - Coils (soft copper), Rigid lengths (hard copper)\n\nHowever, you can use only the hard copper rigid lengths for water distribution piping.\n\nSteel pipes\nWelded and seamless steel galvanized pipe may be used for water supply in industrial applications and for the repair of existing galvanized steel piping systems.\n\nPlastic pipes\nSeveral types of plastic pipes are used for water distribution; however, some are limited to cold water applications only.\n\nThe types of plastic pipes and their applications are as follows:\n- Polyvinyl chloride series 80, 100, 125, 160, and 200 (PVC): For cold water distribution only\n- Chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC): Hot and cold water distribution\n- Polybutylene (Poly B): Hot and cold water distribution\n- Polyethylene aluminum polyethylene (PE-AL-PE): Cold water distribution only\n- Cross-linked polyethylene aluminum cross-linked polyethylene (PEX-AL-PEX): Hot and cold water distribution\n- Polypropylene (PP-R): Hot and cold water distribution\n\nJoining methods for water distribution piping and fittings\n\nPipe and tubing joining methods\nA gas technician/fitter use several methods to join the various types of water service piping and tubing.\n\nThe types of joints used include\n• threaded;\n• soldered;\n• compression;\n• flared;\n• solvent welded;\n• crimped; and\n• cold flared.\n\nThreaded joints\nThreaded joints are used on some water pipes and fittings, as well as on adapters, such as those used to join the threaded outlets of a hot water heater to incoming copper or plastic water distribution tubing. You should use an approved thread sealant with this type of joint.\n\nSolder joints\nSoldering can refer to the process of joining two or more pieces of metal together by means of an alloy with a lower melting temperature than the metal being joined. The many different solders available use alloys consisting of various combinations of tin, lead, silver, and copper.\n\nSoft soldering and hard soldering\nJoining copper tubing using hard and soft solders is common in the plumbing and gas trades. The difference between a soft-soldered and a hard-soldered joint (also known as \"silver brazing\") is the melting temperature of the alloy being used. Hard solders have a melting temperature above 1000 °F (537 °C) and provide a stronger joint.\n\n(Plumbing products, such as flux and solder, now come lead-free.)\n\nCompression joints\nA compression-type fitting often joins copper and plastic tubing and consists of a fitting body, a nut, and a ferrule. Place the nut and ferrule over the tubing, then insert the tubing into the fitting body. Next, tighten the nut onto the external thread of the fitting body, compressing the ferrule and sealing the joint. In some cases when plastic tubing is used, place a supporting insert inside the tubing to prevent it from collapsing as it is being tightened.\n\nFlared joints\nFlared joints are used on soft copper tubing. This type of joint requires a special tool to form the flare on the end of the tubing. This process works as follows:\n1) Cut the end of the copper tubing square and smooth. You may ream the inside edge and slightly chamfer the outside edge to ensure a clean, tight joint.\n2) Place a flare nut and any other necessary parts of the fitting over the copper tubing in the correct orientation and slide down the tubing to leave the end clear for flaring.\n3) Insert the tubing into the block of the flaring tool. The block or die bar of the compression-type flaring tool swings open to allow insertion of the copper tubing and, when closed and tightened by wing nuts, holds the tubing securely in position. You can also use a ratchet-style flaring tool.\n4) Centre the die over the open end of the tubing and turn the handle to force the die down onto the tubing to form the flare.\n\nSolvent-welded joints\nSome plastic pipes are joined by using solvent cement. In this method, the joint consists of a pipe end and a socket fitting. The piping end must be square, and the pipe and socket fitting clean and dry. Apply the cement to both the pipe and socket, then push the pipe into the socket with a twisting motion to make the joint. The cement must be suitable for the type of pipe being used.\n\nCrimped joints\nThis type of joint is used with plastic tubing and consists of an insert fitting with raised grooves (barb type) on the ends, which are inserted into the tubing, and a crimp ring that is placed over the tubing. A special crimping tool, sized for the tubing diameter, is used to compress the ring.\n\nExpansion joints\nThis type of joint uses the memory effect of polyethylene to make a watertight seal and is typically used with PEX-a, cross-linked polyethylene.\n\nThe fitting is slightly larger than the original inside diameter of the tubing, so the \"memory effect\" causes the material to try to return the tubing to its original form, providing a continuous, watertight seal.\n\nThis process works as follows:\n1) Cut the tube square then place a polyethylene collar over the end of the tube.\n2) Place a special tool at the end of the tube and expand the tube and collar.\n3) Remove the tool and insert the fitting into the tube.\n4) The tube will immediately begin to return to its original diameter, in effect, shrinking itself around the fitting to create a watertight seal.\n\nThe collar provides extra strength at the joint. It is also colour-coded to provide identification of hot and cold water lines.",

          "content": "CSA Unit 8 - Intro to Piping \nand Tubing Systems\nChapter 1                                \nPiping and Tubing Systems\nA gas technician/fitter must know how to select and use the different \ntypes of piping, tubing, valves, and connectors for constructing gas \ndistribution systems. This guide covers the requirements, specifications, \nand proper installation methods for various piping materials used in gas \nsystems.\nMK by Mike Kapin\nCreated\nCopywrite 2025\nObjectives and Terminology\nObjectives\nAt the end of this Chapter, you will be able to:\n•\ndescribe requirements of piping, tubing, and connectors\n•\ndescribe valves and fittings\nKey Terminology\nUnderstanding the following terms is essential for gas \ntechnicians:\n•\nConnector - Tubing or hose with a fitting at each end for \nconnecting an appliance with piping\n•\nCSST - Corrugated stainless steel tubing with PVC \ncovering\n•\nFlexible metallic hose - All-metallic flexible gas conduit\n•\nNPT - National Pipe Thread Taper standard for threaded \npipes\n•\nNPS - Nominal Pipe Size standard for pipe dimensions\nPiping Material Requirements\nSteel Gas Piping\nMust conform to ASTM specification A53 or A106. Gas technicians most commonly use \nblack pipe for gas with pipe fittings of steel or malleable iron.\nCopper Tubing\nMust conform to ASTM B837 for G tube and ASTM B88 for type K and L tube. Type M \ncopper tubing cannot be used in gas systems due to insufficient wall thickness.\nCorrugated Stainless Steel Tubing\nConsists of continuous, flexible, stainless steel pipe with exterior PVC covering. \nAvailable for installation on gas systems up to 5 psig.\nPolyethylene Pipe\nUsed for underground gas piping. Must conform to CSA B137.4 for distribution mains, \nhouse service lines, and after meter kits.\nPipe Sizing and Measurement\nNominal Pipe Size (NPS)\nThe gas industry sizes black pipe using the Nominal Pipe Size \n(NPS). For any nominal size of pipe, the outside diameter (OD) \nremains the same and the inside diameter (ID) changes as the \nwall thickness increases.\nNominal size is a designation used for general identification. \nPipe is threaded on the outside only, therefore, the OD must \nremain constant.\nPipe measurement - end-to-center measurement\nThreading and Pipe Ends\nNPT Threading\nGas piping utilizes a tapered \nthread (NPT) cut on a pipe \nthreading machine or hand \ntool. The taper on NPT \nthreads allows them to form \na seal when torqued as the \nflanks of the threads \ncompress against each \nother.\nTypes of Pipe Ends\nGas piping and tubing ends \nmay be finished in the \nfollowing ways, depending \non the application: plain, \ngrooved, bevelled, and \nthreaded.\nWall Thickness\nSteel pipe used for gas systems is either Schedule 40 (standard) \nor Schedule 80 (extra heavy), with Schedule referring to the wall \nthickness of the pipe. Both have the same outside diameter.\nCopper Pipe and Tubing\nAdvantages of Copper Pipe\n•\nFlexibility and ease of bending\n•\nLow weight\n•\nEase of making connections\n•\nCorrosion resistance\n•\nAvailable in long lengths\n•\nRequires fewer and smaller tools to install\n•\nCleaner than steel pipe\nThese factors combine to make copper systems easier and \nquicker to install. In multi-Chapter buildings, the long \nlengths of tubing are safer because they require fewer joints.\nTypes of Copper Tubing\nCopper tubing for gas systems must conform to:\n•\nASTM B837 for G tube\n•\nASTM B88 for type K and L tube (seamless water tube)\nTwo basic kinds of copper tubing:\n•\nSoft drawn (soft temper annealed) - Supplied in coils, \nmost commonly used for gas systems\n•\nHard drawn (hard temper) - Comes in straight lengths, \nused when larger pipe sizes are required\nJoining Copper Tubing\nBrazing Method\nUse phosphorous-free material having a melting point in excess of \n1000°F (525°C). This creates a strong, permanent connection suitable \nfor gas systems.\n45° Brass Flare Connectors\nUse an appropriate flaring tool that matches the OD of the tube and \nhas the appropriate 45° flare angle. The tool usually consists of \nflaring bars with openings for various tube sizes, a yoke with flaring \ncone, and a clamp.\nFlaring Process\nCut the copper tube square using an appropriate tubing cutter. \nAfter cutting, ream the tube to the full ID leaving no inside burr. \nResize tube that is out of round prior to flaring back to round.\nFlaring Copper Tubing\nReaming the Tubing\nAfter cutting the copper tube square, it must be reamed to remove any burrs that could restrict gas flow or create turbulence in the system.\nFlaring the Tubing\nThe flaring tool creates a precise 45° flare that will mate perfectly with the flare fitting to create a gas-tight seal when properly tightened.\nCompleted 45° Flare\nThe finished flare should be smooth, without cracks or thin spots, and should seat properly against the fitting to ensure a leak-free connection.\nCorrugated Stainless Steel Tubing (CSST)\nCSST Characteristics\nCorrugated stainless steel gas tubing consists of a continuous, flexible, \nstainless steel pipe with an exterior PVC covering. The piping comes in \ncoils that have undergone air-testing for leaks.\nMost often installed in a central manifold configuration (also called parallel \nconfiguration) with lines that extend to gas appliances. CSST is lightweight \nand requires fewer connections than traditional gas piping, because it can \nbe bent easily and routed around obstacles.\nComponents of the Titeflex CSST system\nFlexible stainless-steel tubing is approved and available for installation on \ngas systems up to 5 psig. It can be purchased in rolls up to 250 ft. (70 m) in \nlength and in diameters of 3/8 in to 1 in.\nCSST Installation Requirements\n1\nMeter Support\nCSST must not be tied directly to a gas meter without \nfirst ensuring that the meter assembly is \nindependently supported, since CSST would not lend \nthe same level of support as iron piping tie.\n2\nManufacturer Systems\nExamples of CSST manufacturers are \nProFlex/WardFlex, Track Pipe, Gas Tite, and Titeflex, \nall of which incorporate corrugated semi-rigid \nstainless-steel tubing and all metal components, \nincluding fittings, valves, and multiport manifolds.\n3\nIdentification\nThe tubing comes with a continuous yellow \npolyethylene coating for easy identification. It can be \nfield measured, cut, and installed using approved \nfittings.\n4\nSystem Benefits\nThe multiport manifold allows for easy, future \nexpansion of the system for room additions or \nadditional appliances. CSST has the potential for \nhigher levels of system safety, because connections \nand joints behind the wall, common in black iron pipe, \nare essentially eliminated.\nAluminum and Polyethylene Piping\nAluminum Tubing Applications\n•\nPilot tubing\n•\nVenting of regulators\n•\nRegulator vent tube within the enclosure of an appliance\nAluminum tubing is joined by means of compression fittings.\nPolyethylene (PE) Piping\nGas technicians often install underground gas piping using \npolyethylene piping. A gas technician must be able to \nrecognize types of polyethylene piping materials, operate \nthe specialized equipment, and perform the different joining \nmethods.\nPolyethylene is a thermoplastic that softens when heated \nand solidifies when cooled, without any chemical reaction \ntaking place. PE piping can be fused by applying heat and \npressure, normally with electricity-powered heating irons.\nPolyethylene Pipe Applications\nUnderground \nApplications\nThe plastic pipe or tubing used \nfor gas distribution systems \nmust conform to CSA B137.4. \nInstallations where you can use \nthis include distribution mains, \nhouse service lines, and after \nmeter kits.\nOutdoor Appliances\nPlastic pipe or tubing can be \ninstalled underground to feed \noutdoor gas-fired appliances \nsuch as pool heaters and BBQs, \nor as a customer supply line from \none building on a property to \nanother on the same property.\nInstallation Limitations\nDue to the fragile nature of \nplastic pipe, it cannot be used as \nabove-grade supply piping. \nSpecial certified sleeves protect \nthe piping as it extends above \ngrade to make the transition to \nthe building supply piping or the \nappliance connection.\nPolyethylene Pipe Markings\nRequired Markings\nIn accordance with CSA B137.4, any polyethylene piping \nshall have a clear marking, in a colour that contrasts with \nthe pipe and at intervals not greater than 4.9 ft (1.5 m), \nthat contains the following information:\n•\nThe manufacturer's name or trademark\n•\nThe minimum wall thickness or standard dimension \nratio (SDR)\n•\nThe date of manufacture or date code\n•\nThe nominal size of the pipe (e.g., NPS 2)\n•\nThe designation B137.4\n•\nThe word \"gas\"\nMaterial Specification Codes\nThere are many different grades of polyethylene (PE) \nused in plastic pipeline systems. Each pipe has a marking \ncontaining the grade of PE and a four-digit code:\n•\nThe first number denotes the density of the pipe\n•\nThe second number is the melt index rating\n•\nThe last two numbers indicate the design strength for \ndensity\nExamples include PE 2306 (medium density) and PE \n3406 (high density).\nPolyethylene Pipe Joining Equipment\nPipe Cutter\nHas a thin cutting wheel \nor blade that helps cut \nplastic pipe cleanly and \nsquarely.\nHeating Iron\nUsually uses electrical \nheating and comes with \nTeflon coating or a \nsimilar non-stick coating \nto prevent the molten \nplastic from sticking to \nthe heating plate.\nButt Fusion Joining \nMachine\nHas a pipe facer \nattachment for \nsimultaneously shaving \noff the ends of two pipes \nand clamps for \nseparately gripping and \naligning pipes or fittings \nduring fusing.\nTemperature \nControl\nHeating irons must be \nset to the desired \ntemperature, 500°F ± \n7°F (260°C ± 4°C), and \nallowed to stabilize \nbefore use.\nPolyethylene Pipe Joining Process\nCutting Pipe Ends\nCut pipe ends square and \nensure that surfaces to be \njoined are properly aligned. \nThis is critical for creating a \nstrong, leak-free joint.\nCleaning Components\nRemove water, dirt, grease, \noil, fingerprints, and \ncuttings. Wipe the inside \nand outside of the pipes with \na clean, lint-free cloth or a \ngood qualit",

The taper on NPT threads allows them to form a seal when torqued as the flanks of the threads compress against each other.\nTypes of Pipe Ends\nGas piping and tubing ends may be finished in the following ways, depending on the application: plain, grooved, bevelled, and threaded.\nWall Thickness\nSteel pipe used for gas systems is either Schedule 40 (standard) or Schedule 80 (extra heavy), with Schedule referring to the wall thickness of the pipe. Both have the same outside diameter.\nCopper Pipe and Tubing\nAdvantages of Copper Pipe\nFlexibility and ease of bending\nLow weight\nEase of making connections\nCorrosion resistance\nAvailable in long lengths\nRequires fewer and smaller tools to install\nCleaner than steel pipe\nThese factors combine to make copper systems easier and quicker to install. In multi-Chapter buildings, the long lengths of tubing are safer because they require fewer joints.\nTypes of Copper Tubing\nCopper tubing for gas systems must conform to:\nASTM B837 for G tube\nASTM B88 for type K and L tube (seamless water tube)\nTwo basic kinds of copper tubing:\nSoft drawn (soft temper annealed) - Supplied in coils, most commonly used for gas systems\nHard drawn (hard temper) - Comes in straight lengths, used when larger pipe sizes are required\nJoining Copper Tubing\nBrazing Method\nUse phosphorous-free material having a melting point in excess of 1000°F (525°C). This creates a strong, permanent connection suitable for gas systems.\n45° Brass Flare Connectors\nUse an appropriate flaring tool that matches the OD of the tube and has the appropriate 45° flare angle. The tool usually consists of flaring bars with openings for various tube sizes, a yoke with flaring cone, and a clamp.\nFlaring Process\nCut the copper tube square using an appropriate tubing cutter. After cutting, ream the tube to the full ID leaving no inside burr. Resize tube that is out of round prior to flaring back to round.\nFlaring Copper Tubing\nReaming the Tubing\nAfter cutting the copper tube square, it must be reamed to remove any burrs that could restrict gas flow or create turbulence in the system.\nFlaring the Tubing\nThe flaring tool creates a precise 45° flare that will mate perfectly with the flare fitting to create a gas-tight seal when properly tightened.\nCompleted 45° Flare\nThe finished flare should be smooth, without cracks or thin spots, and should seat properly against the fitting to ensure a leak-free connection.\nCorrugated Stainless Steel Tubing (CSST)\nCSST Characteristics\nCorrugated stainless steel gas tubing consists of a continuous, flexible, stainless steel pipe with an exterior PVC covering. The piping comes in coils that have undergone air-testing for leaks.\nMost often installed in a central manifold configuration (also called parallel configuration) with lines that extend to gas appliances. CSST is lightweight and requires fewer connections than traditional gas piping, because it can be bent easily and routed around obstacles.\nComponents of the Titeflex CSST system\nFlexible stainless-steel tubing is approved and available for installation on gas systems up to 5 psig. It can be purchased in rolls up to 250 ft. (70 m) in length and in diameters of 3/8 in to 1 in.\nCSST Installation Requirements\n1\nMeter Support\nCSST must not be tied directly to a gas meter without first ensuring that the meter assembly is independently supported, since CSST would not lend the same level of support as iron piping tie.\n2\nManufacturer Systems\nExamples of CSST manufacturers are ProFlex/WardFlex, Track Pipe, Gas Tite, and Titeflex, all of which incorporate corrugated semi-rigid stainless-steel tubing and all metal components, including fittings, valves, and multiport manifolds.\n3\nIdentification\nThe tubing comes with a continuous yellow polyethylene coating for easy identification. It can be field measured, cut, and installed using approved fittings.\n4\nSystem Benefits\nThe multiport manifold allows for easy, future expansion of the system for room additions or additional appliances. CSST has the potential for higher levels of system safety, because connections and joints behind the wall, common in black iron pipe, are essentially eliminated.\nAluminum and Polyethylene Piping\nAluminum Tubing Applications\nPilot tubing\nVenting of regulators\nRegulator vent tube within the enclosure of an appliance\nAluminum tubing is joined by means of compression fittings.\nPolyethylene (PE) Piping\nGas technicians often install underground gas piping using polyethylene piping. A gas technician must be able to recognize types of polyethylene piping materials, operate the specialized equipment, and perform the different joining methods.\nPolyethylene is a thermoplastic that softens when heated and solidifies when cooled, without any chemical reaction taking place. PE piping can be fused by applying heat and pressure, normally with electricity-powered heating irons.\nPolyethylene Pipe Applications\nUnderground Applications\nThe plastic pipe or tubing used for gas distribution systems must conform to CSA B137.4. Installations where you can use this include distribution mains, house service lines, and after meter kits.\nOutdoor Appliances\nPlastic pipe or tubing can be installed underground to feed outdoor gas-fired appliances such as pool heaters and BBQs, or as a customer supply line from one building on a property to another on the same property.\nInstallation Limitations\nDue to the fragile nature of plastic pipe, it cannot be used as above-grade supply piping. Special certified sleeves protect the piping as it extends above grade to make the transition to the building supply piping or the appliance connection.\nPolyethylene Pipe Markings\nRequired Markings\nIn accordance with CSA B137.4, any polyethylene piping shall have a clear marking, in a colour that contrasts with the pipe and at intervals not greater than 4.9 ft (1.5 m), that contains the following information:\nThe manufacturer's name or trademark\nThe minimum wall thickness or standard dimension ratio (SDR)\nThe date of manufacture or date code\nThe nominal size of the pipe (e.g., NPS 2)\nThe designation B137.4\nThe word \"gas\"\nMaterial Specification Codes\nThere are many different grades of polyethylene (PE) used in plastic pipeline systems. Each pipe has a marking containing the grade of PE and a four-digit code:\nThe first number denotes the density of the pipe\nThe second number is the melt index rating\nThe last two numbers indicate the design strength for density\nExamples include PE 2306 (medium density) and PE 3406 (high density).\nPolyethylene Pipe Joining Equipment\nPipe Cutter\nHas a thin cutting wheel or blade that helps cut plastic pipe cleanly and squarely.\nHeating Iron\nUsually uses electrical heating and comes with Teflon coating or a similar non-stick coating to prevent the molten plastic from sticking to the heating plate.\nButt Fusion Joining Machine\nHas a pipe facer attachment for simultaneously shaving off the ends of two pipes and clamps for separately gripping and aligning pipes or fittings during fusing.\nTemperature Control\nHeating irons must be set to the desired temperature, 500°F ± 7°F (260°C ± 4°C), and allowed to stabilize before use.\nPolyethylene Pipe Joining Process\nCutting Pipe Ends\nCut pipe ends square and ensure that surfaces to be joined are properly aligned. This is critical for creating a strong, leak-free joint.\nCleaning Components\nRemove water, dirt, grease, oil, fingerprints, and cuttings. Wipe the inside and outside of the pipes with a clean, lint-free cloth or a good quality paper towel and some soap and water.\nAdjusting Heating Iron Temperature\nSet the thermoswitch to the desired temperature, allow it to stabilize, then check the temperature with a tempilstik.
