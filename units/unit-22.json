          "content": "Chapter 1 covers draft and venting fundamentals. Appliances are categorized into four categories. Category II appliances are mid and high efficiency appliances designed for use with a power venter located at the outside wall termination to ensure negative vent pressure is maintained, as well as some direct vent balanced flue appliances. Category III includes induced and forced-draft appliances where the fan or blower produces sufficient draft to overcome the resistance of the burner and vent system. Category IV includes high-efficiency condensing-type appliances. All forced air gas-fired furnaces manufactured or sold in Canada since January 1, 2010 are required to be high-efficiency condensing-type appliances.\n\nDraft is the flow of air or combustion gas products (or a combination of the two) through an appliance and its venting system. It is indicated by the difference between the pressure at a specific point in the appliance or venting system and the pressure of the air at the same elevation outside the appliance or venting system.\n\nAir is required for combustion to meet three requirements: air for combustion (for every 1000 Btu produced by any fuel, 10 ft³ of air is required, plus additional requirements of excess air to ensure complete combustion), dilution air for the draft diverter, and air for ventilation. To meet these requirements, for every 1000 Btu (0.293 kW) produced by burning natural gas or propane, up to 30 ft³ (0.85 m³) of air may be required. Even more additional air may have to be provided to compensate for the operation of range hoods, clothes dryers, and exhaust fans which can cause a negative pressure condition in the building. A negative pressure of more than 0.02 in w.c. (5 Pa) can cause natural draft appliances (those with draft control devices) to spill the products of combustion into the building.\n\nDraft movement may occur naturally or can be accelerated by a power vent device such as a blower. Natural draft is any draft other than mechanical draft. For example, a draft can be developed by the difference in temperature of hot gases in a vent or chimney and outdoor air temperature. The natural-draft vent or gravity vent relies on the upward movement of hot gases creating a slight negative pressure in the vent or chimney. Blowers are not needed to assist draft with a gravity vent. Mechanical draft is the draft that a mechanical device (e.g., fan, blower, aspirator) produces and that may supplement natural draft. The two main types are forced draft (a product of a mechanical device upstream from the combustion zone) and induced draft (a product of a device downstream from the combustion zone).\n\nDraft effects include downdraft/backdraft (a condition of the venting system in which a draft is reversed down and can cause products of combustion to spill), stack effect (the tendency of heated gas to rise in a vertical passage such as a chimney, small enclosure, or stairwell), and wind effect (wind and eddy currents may cause negative suction pressure at the vent termination that will increase draft).\n\nOver-fire draft is the pressure measured over the flame in the combustion chamber compared to the pressure of the outside of the combustion chamber. It can be positive (positive pressure over the fire), negative (negative pressure over the fire), or neutral (neutral pressure over the fire). To prevent flue gas spillage, ensure that the heat exchanger and any portion of the venting system that is under positive pressure are sealed.\n\nThe quantity of theoretical draft in a stack, measured in inches of water column (in w.c.) or in Pascals (Pa), is directly proportional to the absolute temperature difference between the stack gas and its surroundings, and to the height of the stack. Draft does not depend on the diameter of the stack. The draft will be greatest when average stack temperature is highest, outdoor air temperature is lowest, and stack height is greatest. The simplified formulas for theoretical draft are: Imperial D = 7.6(Ts-Ta)/(Ts×Ta) × H, Metric D = 3450(Ts-Ta)/(Ts×Ta) × H. To take into account the heat lost through the stack walls as the hot gases pass through the stack, the average stack temperature (Ts) is the point halfway between the inlet temperature at the bottom and the outlet temperature at the top of the stack.\n\nSince the temperature inside a natural draft vent system represents the power available to operate the vent, the Btu/h (kW) capacity of the vent depends on the temperature. The hotter the vent gases, the lighter they are and the greater the force that expels them through the vent. Average stack temperature is determined by taking an average of the temperature at the flue collar and the temperature at the vent termination.\n\nAs hot flue gases travel through the vent system, they lose heat through the walls of the vent. As the gases cool, they become denser and the draft effect is lessened. Single-wall metal vents conduct heat readily to the surrounding air. Some non-metallic materials used for vents may absorb large amounts of heat. Double-wall metal vents are often preferred because of the insulating quality of the air space between the walls, and because the relatively small mass of metal in the inner wall does not absorb much heat. To minimize heat loss, CSA B149.1 and the vent manufacturer's instructions require the installation of the vent in an insulated space or its insulation except where the vent rises above the roof line or passes through an outside wall.\n\nA heat reclaimer is a device that you may install externally or internally to a venting system to extract heat from flue gases. Clause 8 of CSA B149.1 details special requirements for heat reclaimers. Never use a heat reclaimer with a gas-fired appliance that is installed in a dwelling unit, mobile home, or recreational vehicle unless it is approved for the application and certified and installed in accordance with manufacturer certified installation instructions. A heat reclaimer installed on a commercial or industrial gas-fired appliance must have approval for the application and be installed in accordance with manufacturer installation instructions.\n\nThe taller the columns of hot gases, the greater the driving force tending to displace them. In general, increasing the vent height increases the draft. Since increased total length also increases the resistance to flow, there will be a limit at which no further benefit will be gained by increasing the vent height. You do not usually encounter this limit in actual practice.\n\nThe volume of flue gases that a gas appliance produces is approximately proportional to the Btu/h (kW) input. Every vent system has a maximum input beyond which no more flow can be accommodated. When this limit is exceeded, a portion of the combustion products will not enter the vent but will spill from the draft-hood into the surrounding space. Each vent also has a minimum capacity below which the gases can condense. The range between the maximum and minimum inputs is called vent capacity, and the vent operates properly only between these inputs.\n\nA venting system consists of everything involved in the venting of flue gases to the outdoors, including components that are integral to the appliance that affect venting. Natural draft vent systems include all components that form the vent itself, including vent connectors, Type B vent, tile or other certified liner, inspection caps, cleanouts, firestops, supports, roof flashing, storm collar, and rain cap as well as components integral to the appliance such as combustion air inlets on the appliance cabinet and a manufacturer-supplied draft-hood. Mechanical draft vent systems components include the blower, special vent material (Type BH vent), termination kits, and condensate traps and drainage equipment. Do not alter any of these components, as alteration can lead to failure of the system or improper venting that can result in the production of carbon monoxide (CO) into the building and will void the certification.\n\nComponents include rain cap/vent top (protects weather elements and foreign objects from entering the vent and reduces downdrafts caused by wind), storm collar (provides additional protection from water seeping between the vent and the roof flashing), roof flashing (fitted around the vent to seal the roof penetration from rain and snow), fire stop spacers (help contain the fire by restricting the stack effect during the fire, required at each ceiling/floor penetration including an attic but not required at the roof penetration), and supports (maintain clearances and carry the weight of the venting system).\n\nThe majority of modern high efficiency gas appliances have special venting systems that operate on mechanical draft. Lower efficient natural draft appliances rely on an external draft control device to maintain a neutral or slightly negative over-fire draft. Two types of draft control devices used on natural draft appliances are draft hood/diverter and barometric damper. These draft control devices control the over-fire draft by the introduction of dilution air, breaking the stack effect on the combustion chamber. Another purpose of the draft control device is to relieve any downdrafts from entering the combustion chamber of the appliance, as well as to allow the appliance to spill through the relief opening if the appliance vent is blocked or restricted.",

          "content": "Chapter 2 covers vent types and terminations. Type A vent is capable of withstanding the highest flue gas temperature. Type B vent is double-wall metal used for Category I appliances. Type C vent is single-wall metal for exhaust canopies with maximum 40 kW (12 kW) input, with joints secured with three screws. Type L vent is used for oil-fired appliances with maximum temperature 243 °C (470 °F). Type BW vent is used with recessed wall furnaces. Type BH vent is special gas vents for condensing appliances.\n\nType BH vents are classified as Class I (rigid stainless steel) and Class II (plastic materials). Class II vents are further classified by temperature rating: Class II A (PVC, max temp 90 °C / 195 °F), Class II B (CPVC, max temp 110 °C / 230 °F), Class II C (polypropylene, max temp 110 °C / 230 °F), and Class II D (ABS, max temp 90 °C / 195 °F). BH Class II A and B temperature-rated vents are secured with locking bands. BH Class II C temperature-rated vents are secured with gear clamps. BH Class II D temperature-rated vents are secured with solvent cement.\n\nThe maximum vent gas temperature for Type B vents is 243 °C (470 °F). The maximum vent gas temperature for Type BH Class IIB vents is 110 °C (230 °F). The maximum vent gas temperature for Type BH Class IIC vents is 110 °C (230 °F).\n\nZ-Flex chimney liners are corrugated flexible aluminum used for masonry chimney relining.\n\nCSA B149.1 prescribes the location of vent and chimney terminations and the minimum height and clearances for vent and chimney outlets. Except for a special venting system with positive vent pressure, a vent may not extend less than 2 ft (600 mm) above the highest point where it passes through a flat roof of a building and not less than 2 ft (600 mm) higher than any part of the building that is 10 ft (3 m) horizontally from the vent outlet. A chimney may not extend less than 3 ft (1 m) above the highest point where it passes through the roof of a building and not less than 2 ft (600 mm) higher than any part of the building that is 10 ft (3 m) horizontally from the chimney outlet.\n\nA vent used in special venting systems with positive vent pressure and passing through a roof must extend at least 18 in (450 mm) above the highest point at which it passes through the roof surface and above any other obstruction within 18 in (450 mm) horizontally of the vent. Except for a special venting system with positive vent pressure, a vent passing through a pitched roof must extend above the highest point where it passes through a roof surface, and not less than 2 ft (600 mm) above any other obstruction within a horizontal distance of 10 ft (3 m).\n\nA vent or a chimney may not extend less than 5 ft (1.5 m) in height above the highest connected appliance draft-hood outlet or flue collar. A vent serving a wall furnace may not extend less than 12 ft (3.6 m) in height above the bottom of the furnace.\n\nSide-wall vented appliances can lead to problems if vent terminations are not properly located. Clause 8.14.8 of CSA B149.1 requires that vents not be located where they may cause hazardous frost or ice accumulations on adjacent property surfaces. On public property, vent terminations may not terminate less than 7 ft (2.13 m) above paved sidewalks or driveways. Under no circumstances may a vent terminate within 6 ft of mechanical air supply inlets. This is to avoid contamination of the incoming air supply over a period of time, which could potentially harm building occupants. For non-mechanical air inlets, the distances from vent terminations are based on the input of the appliance since this determines the amount of flue gas being discharged.\n\nCoaxial vent terminations for direct vent appliances serve as the exhaust vent as well as the air supply opening; therefore, they must conform to both Clauses 8.14 and 8.3. Distances are also prescribed from a gas service regulator vent outlet, windows, doors, and other air supply inlets or combustion air inlets. Clause 8.14.8 also cross references Table 5.3 of the regulator section to give clearances from exterior vent outlets of indoor regulators.\n\nTo ensure the free circulation of outside air and proper venting, the Code outlines several requirements governing the location of vent terminations underneath verandas, porches, or decks. To avoid the risk of plugging from snow, leaf, and debris accumulation, vents must terminate at least 1 ft (300 mm) above grade level. In some jurisdictions of higher snow accumulation, this height may be increased. Manufacturers may give a minimum height above the anticipated snow line. A vent is permitted underneath a verandah, porch, or deck only where there are 2 fully open sides beneath the floor. A minimum 12 in (300 mm) must be maintained from the vent to the underside of the verandah, porch, or deck. The vent must be fitted with a cap in accordance with the vent manufacturer's installation instructions.\n\nHigh efficiency sidewall vent terminations: As high efficiency appliances no longer rely on the natural draft created by the vent height, sidewall venting has become increasingly popular. Flue gases from these high efficiency appliances have lower temperatures and therefore large amounts of condensing water vapour. CSA B149.1 does not address the impact of vent gases on the building envelope or those of neighbouring buildings. Some local jurisdictions are beginning to look at the issue and are considering placing restrictions on the location of the vents. The warm moist gases can move up the wall of the house and against any overhangs above. This can lead to visible frost buildup in the winter which can have an impact on the long-term durability of the building materials. In some cases, the ice buildup may occur on the neighbour's house.\n\nFlue gases moving up the house can enter the attic through the soffit vents where they can condense on the framing and underside of the roof sheathing. To avoid problems, provide proper care and attention to the design and installation of these vents to ensure the exhaust is dissipated away from the building. Installation recommendations include: place vent termination in an exposed location where flue gases can dissipate widely, preferable through the roof; don't place sidewall vent terminations near openings or underneath any structure that can obstruct the dissipation of the exhaust gases; ensure penetrations through the building enclosure maintain the continuity of the air barrier; if there are vented soffits above a sidewall vent, the soffit vents should have sealing for 6 ft on either side of a vertical centerline from the vent even if the vent is two floors above.\n\nAs per Figure 2-1 (Table 8.6), the minimum Type C vent connector clearance for a boiler is 6 in (150 mm).",

          "content": "Chapter 3 covers venting system design. Single appliance venting chart and two or more appliances common venting chart provide flowcharts for design decisions. For new installations, perform heat loss calculations and size unit correctly. For replacement installations, size unit correctly based on output rating, NOT size of existing vent. Check suitability of existing vent or chimney. If a liner is required in a chimney, refer to GVR C.2.11.\n\nFor fan-assisted appliances, the appliance input (FAN column) must fall between Min. and Max. vent capacity in Tables C.1 and C.2. Use DP column in Tables C.1 and C.2 if building is tight or contains air exhausting appliances. For natural draft appliances, follow similar procedures using NAT columns.\n\nComplex layouts occur when more than two 90° elbows are installed. When this occurs, reduce vent capacities in Tables C.1 and C.2 as per GVR C.2.4. When the appliance is located far from the vertical vent or chimney, a double-walled vent or connector may be required. Simple layouts occur when 2 or less 90° elbows are installed. In this case, Tables C.1 and C.2 may be used as listed with no adjustments of vent capacities to account for additional fittings. Simple layouts perform better, save time and material.\n\nFor common venting with two or more appliances, combined appliance inputs must be used. For all fan-assisted appliances, use FAN + FAN column in Tables C.3, C.4, C.7, and C.8. For fan-assisted and natural draft combination, use DP(F+N) column. For all natural draft appliances, use DP(N+N) column. When more than two 90° elbows are installed, reduce vent capacities as per GVR C.2.4. See GVR C.2.5 & C.2.6 when common vent connector manifold or offsets are used.\n\nMulti-storey appliance venting designs require special consideration. For new venting systems, obtain the design from a design professional or the venting system manufacturer. Review the design with the local inspection authority and/or utility before installation to avoid costly surprises. Install the system according to the design drawing and specifications. Seek prior approval for substitution of certified components. Where the system has been engineered, the designer must review the installation before it is closed in. Arrange and coordinate inspections according to the work plan and avoid delays.\n\nFor replacement of appliances in an existing multi-storey system, the replacement appliance(s) should be of the same size (output capacity) and venting type (fan-assisted versus natural draft) as the original appliance(s). The replacements should be compatible with the multi-storey venting system. Do not make significant changes to the venting system or add additional appliance inputs without first seeking competent advice. If venting system performance problems are observed or reported, do not proceed with any alteration to the system or connect appliances without contacting the local inspection authority or utility.\n\nVenting manifolds can be sloped or horizontal. Exceeding the minimum slope requirements for a manifold can cause trouble, such as draft hood spillage from the appliance most distant from the vertical vent. The lack of adequate connector rise causes spillage. It is preferable by far to use a horizontal manifold than to slope it excessively. All heaters need adequate connector rise for proper operation.\n\nManifolds can be tapered or constant-size. Tapered manifolds are sized for the actual input to the particular section. Constant-size manifolds use the selected common vent size throughout. There is no significant difference in the operating characteristics of these two options. For tapered manifolds, increase the total combined rated heat input by 11% for each section (which is the same as reducing table capacity to 90%). For constant-size manifolds, add together the rated inputs of all connected appliances and multiply the sum by 1.11.\n\nInstallation checklists should be followed before beginning installation and during installation to ensure adherence to processes. Before assembling an appliance, check that it is compatible with house-as-a-system requirements, approved by local inspection authority or utility, certified and appropriately sized, all components certified, venting system design checked for proper application, detailed sketch available with dimensions and sizes, special tools available if required, existing chimney inspected, and installers experienced and qualified. During installation, check that appliance can be installed according to venting system design, all required components installed, all joints properly connected with no projections, all clearances maintained, combustion air supply working, venting properly supported and protected, and all markings and labels intact.\n\nCategory I appliances can be vented using the Annex C Code tables. A Type B vent passing through an unused masonry chimney flue shall be considered an exterior chimney. When reducing the size of a vent connector from that of the draft-hood, a minimum total vent height of 10 ft is required. When sizing the vent for a high altitude installation, use sea level rating when determining maximum capacity.\n\nA single fan-assisted furnace may be vented into a tile lined masonry chimney. A fan-assisted furnace may be vented into a masonry chimney that is serving a draft-hood-equipped appliance. The vent for a fan assisted appliance with a 4-in flue collar may be reduced to 3 in if determined by the tables. A single vented fan-assisted appliance requiring three elbows for the vent connector requires the table capacity to be reduced by 10%.\n\nWhen the vent table in Annex C permits more than one diameter of pipe for a connector or the vent, the larger connector or vent is preferred. If the vent connectors are connected to a horizontal common vent connector manifold, the common vent capacity table must be reduced by 10%. If the common vent is offset, the common vent capacity table must be reduced by 20%.\n\nOf connector configurations, a straight vertical connection is most effective at minimizing spillage. Configurations with lateral offsets are less effective, with longer lateral runs being the least effective.",

          "content": "Chapter 4 provides detailed vent sizing calculation examples and practice problems. Example 8 demonstrates sizing for fan-assisted and draft-hood-equipped appliances with Type B vent connectors to a masonry chimney. A 40 MBtu/h draft-hood-equipped water heater with 2-ft rise and a 60 MBtu/h fan-assisted furnace with 1-ft rise are connected to a 30-ft high masonry chimney. Using Table C.7, a 4-in vent connector is required for the water heater (capacity 61 MBtu/h). For the furnace, a 4-in connector provides a range of 37-111 MBtu/h, which accommodates the 60 MBtu/h furnace.\n\nFor the masonry chimney, an 8 × 12 in liner has an equivalent internal area of 63.6 in² per Table C.10. At 30 ft height, a chimney with minimum internal area of 28 in² provides a capacity of 251 MBtu/h, so the chimney is not too small. However, Clause 8.12.8 must be checked. For a combined input of 100 MBtu/h, the limit is 100 × 1.25 = 125 MBtu/h. The 8 × 12 nominal chimney with 251 MBtu/h capacity is oversized.\n\nExample 9 continues from Example 8 with a certified corrugated liner installation. Clause C.2.11 requires a 20% reduction of capacity for corrugated liners. The liner carries only 80% of the listed capacity. To find the correct diameter, adjust the capacity: 100 MBtu/h ÷ 80% = 125 MBtu/h. Using Table C.3 at 30 ft height, the first DP(F+N) column with capacity equal to or greater than 125 MBtu/h is 128 MBtu/h, corresponding to a 4-in diameter vent. Check: 128 × 0.8 = 102.4 MBtu/h, which is greater than 100 MBtu/h.\n\nExample 10 demonstrates sizing with a vent connector manifold. A 40 MBtu/h draft-hood-equipped water heater with 1-ft rise and a 60 MBtu/h fan-assisted furnace with 2-ft rise are common vented to a 30-ft height Type B vent. Both connectors are single-wall type attached to a vent connector manifold. Using Table C.4, the water heater requires a 4-in vent connector (capacity 53 MBtu/h). The furnace requires a 3-in connector (range 50-62 MBtu/h). General venting requirement No. 4 requires a 10% reduction of common vent capacity to 90% when a vent connector manifold is used. Adjust the capacity: 100 MBtu/h ÷ 90% = 111 MBtu/h. At 30 ft height, a 4-in common vent has a capacity of 123 MBtu/h in the DP(F+N) column.\n\nExample 11 demonstrates sizing with a common vent offset. A 40 MBtu/h draft-hood-equipped water heater with 2-ft rise and a 90 MBtu/h fan-assisted furnace with 3-ft rise are common vented to a 30-ft height Type B vent with an offset. Clause C.2.6 requires a 20% reduction of common vent capacity to 80% when a common vent offset is used. Using Table C.4, the water heater requires a 4-in connector (capacity 62 MBtu/h). The furnace requires a 4-in connector (range 85-119 MBtu/h). Total input is 130 MBtu/h. Adjust for offset: 130 MBtu/h ÷ 80% = 162.5 MBtu/h. A 5-in common vent has a capacity of 188 MBtu/h and may be used. The length of the offset would be limited to a maximum of 7.5 ft (1.5 ft per inch of diameter).\n\nExample 12 demonstrates interpolating between table values. An installer has a 75 MBtu/h input appliance with a 4-in diameter draft-hood outlet that needs to be vented into a 12-ft high Type B vent. The vent connector has a 5-ft lateral length. Worst case scenario solution: select the next lowest height. At 10-ft height and 5-ft lateral, the 4-in diameter NAT Max column shows a capacity value of 77 MBtu/h. Since the 4-in system would adequately vent the unit at 10 ft of height, it will operate even better at 12 ft of height. Interpolation solution: At 10-ft height and 5-ft lateral, capacity is 77 MBtu/h. At 15-ft height and 5-ft lateral, capacity is 87 MBtu/h. The difference is 10 MBtu/h. The capacity for a 12-ft height is equal to the capacity for 10 ft plus 2/5 of the difference: 77 + (2/5 × 10) = 81 MBtu/h.\n\nPractice problems cover various scenarios including individual vent sizing for NAT and FAN appliances in tight buildings, common vent sizing for FAN/NAT combinations with various rises and heights, masonry chimney minimum and maximum internal area calculations, common vent offset maximum length (1.5 ft per inch of diameter), and application of Clause 8.12.8 maximum listed table capacity (total input × 1.25).",

          "content": "Chapter 5 covers venting system problems. Venting system problems are the most common problem in the gas industry. To avoid venting problems, a gas technician/fitter should check for flue gas spillage, condensation, and corrosion.\n\nThe spillage of combustion products can occur when a spillage-susceptible appliance is subjected to a sustained negative pressure greater than the buoyancy venting pressure it can establish during its operation. Flue gas spillage is the most serious venting problem, particularly if it is prolonged. The recirculation of flue gases through the burner of an appliance creates carbon monoxide, a colourless, odourless and deadly gas. Even if CO is not developed, many people experience irritation and discomfort from flue gases that spill into the occupied space of a building.\n\nThe most common cause of spillage is a failure to control negative air pressures in a building where buoyancy-vented appliances are installed. This is considered to be the lack of make-up air. Other causes include blocked or restricted venting system (bird nests, debris, incorrectly sized vent caps), incorrectly sized venting system (too small, excessive elbows, long lateral runs), leaks in venting system (improperly joined and sealed components), and improper vent configuration (common when fan-assisted and draft-hood-equipped appliances are connected to a common vent - configure so draft-hood-equipped vent connector enters common vent above fan-assisted vent connector).\n\nSpillage susceptibility involves both the venting characteristics of the appliance and the method of venting. Appliances are considered spillage-susceptible when buoyancy drives venting or venting system is not gas-tight. Non-spillage-susceptible appliances are power vented to a gas-tight venting system, making them resistant to spillage at relatively high negative building pressures. The currently established threshold of negative pressure that an appliance must withstand to be considered non-spillage susceptible is -0.02 in w.c. (-5 Pa).\n\nCategory I natural draft and fan-assisted appliances are considered spillage susceptible, as are Category II appliances. Type B, Type BW, and Type L vents that are not gas-tight are also considered spillage susceptible. Induced or forced-draft gas appliances (Categories III and IV) are not considered spillage susceptible when connected to a gas-tight venting system (e.g., Type BH with sealed joints). Direct vent appliances (in any Category I through IV) due to their sealed method of air supply and venting are also considered non-spillage susceptible.\n\nDo not install Category I natural-draft or fan-assisted gas appliances in buildings that experience greater than -0.02 in w.c. (-5 Pa) pressure. When specifying gas appliances, consider if the building contains air exhausting appliances without provision of makeup air, is of recent construction with tight building envelope, or if the structure complies with CSA B149.1 Clause 8.2.1 a) or b). If yes, avoid spillage-susceptible appliances. If spillage-susceptible appliances are installed, make suitable provisions for make-up air.\n\nIn a properly designed and installed venting system, the amount of condensation forming in the vent is negligible, and as the vent or chimney warms up during appliance operation, this evaporates and travels to the outdoors. Avoid excessive condensation in the venting system. Prolonged periods of condensation can lead to puddles of water in the building and to moisture damage within the fabric of the building if condensate leaks through joints in the concealed sections of the venting system. Corrosion of metal vents may also occur as a result of prolonged condensation.\n\nCauses of condensation include cold vents or chimneys (all Category I appliance vents and chimneys must be warm to perform properly, avoid exterior vents and chimneys unless properly insulated, cold vents cause condensation throughout the entire operating time during colder periods, problem most severe when only fan-assisted appliances connected since there is no draft hood to allow heated inside air to warm the vent during off-cycles) and oversized venting systems (internal surface area of the vent is too large to warm above the dew point of the flue gases 127 to 130 °F, particularly problematic with fan-assisted appliances which have higher efficiency hence lower flue gas temperature and no dilution air entering the venting system during operation, always size venting systems serving fan-assisted appliances using the minimum allowable vent diameters).\n\nCorrosion in the venting system is most often a secondary effect of condensation. It may be as a result of the reaction caused when a chlorinated hydrocarbon is heated in air. In the presence of a very slight trace of water, it will form hydrochloric acid, which has a highly corrosive effect on most metals. Corrosion can be a result of either the flue products condensing in the vent system or an outside source of corrosive vapours. To avoid corrosion problems due to condensation, you may use only venting systems designed for condensing appliances on condensing appliances. Conventional venting systems require flue temperatures above the point at which the flue products will start to condense. The corrosive vapours can enter the appliance with the combustion air and travel through the combustion process then be carried into the venting systems to cause corrosion problems.\n\nOther venting system problems can occur from leaking, sagging, incorrect grade, poor location, and wind effect (cold and hot backdraft). Draft hood spillage is the escape of flue gases from the relief opening of the draft hood of a natural draft appliance. On start-up, a little spillage of short duration is normal, but if it does not stop after a minute or two, there may be something wrong in the venting system. The smoke taper test is used to check for draft hood spillage. Hold a lighted taper just under the rim of the draft hood relief opening. Proper venting will draw the taper smoke towards or into the draft hood. The escape or spillage of burned gas through improper venting will cause the smoke to blow away from the relief opening.\n\nProblems in the vent include inadequate connector size in a combined venting system, insufficient connector rise in a combined venting system, blockage (partial or total), excessively long connector (especially single-wall), too many fittings that change direction causing excessive flow resistance, vent not high enough, incorrect cap causes flow restriction, building depressurization, and pressure from thermal effects.\n\nAn appliance may fail to operate for many reasons, some related to the venting system. An undersized or otherwise improperly designed venting system may cause a venting safety control to prevent burner ignition or shut it down if draft hood spillage occurs. With a fan-assisted combustion appliance, positive pressure in the vent or inadequate vent flow may prevent or interrupt burner operation. A draft hood appliance equipped with a blocked vent detection device (spill switch) may have the burner shut off if spillage continues for a period of time, or the burner may operate intermittently for short periods.\n\nCold backdraft occurs when an appliance is not operating and cold air comes out of the relief opening. This is not a venting malfunction but occurs due to indoor-outdoor temperature difference causing cold air to be drawn down the vent. This flow reversal can also result from fan or fireplace operation. Winds can cause a cold backdraft. Hot backdraft can occur if a cold backdraft has reversed flow in the vent and the appliance burner comes on, appearing as draft hood spillage with total spillage of hot flue products because the vent does not carry away any flue products.\n\nLeakage of products of combustion can occur at piping and fitting joints or between elbow segments if there is positive vent pressure due to control malfunction on the appliance, undersized vent, or any use of Type B gas vent on an appliance that creates positive pressure. The remedy is to use a larger or higher vent with increased capacity or reduce its flow resistance. Type B vents should not be used with Category III appliances. The incorrect remedy that violates the Type B product listing is to tape the joints externally.\n\nCoaxial venting leak test: Continuous short cycling of a coaxial direct vented appliance can indicate a leaking venting system where flue gas is being drawn into the combustion air. Check by measuring the CO2 concentration of the combustion air in the annular gap of the air intake pipe. The vent pipe is considered sufficiently leak-proof if a CO2 concentration in the combustion air no higher than 0.2% or an O2 concentration no lower than 20.6% is measured relative to a starting O2 concentration of 20.9%.\n\nWith appliances operating at average steady state efficiencies of 75 to 80%, the probability of condensed water dripping from Type B is negligible. When steady state efficiencies rise above 80% and the appliance has no draft hood, the water vapour concentration in the vent will be higher so water can condense at a higher temperature. If the vent gases undergo excessive cooling (as with long laterals in cold unheated locations) condensation leakage occurs if the vent does not warm up or there are repeated short operating cycles.\n\nA Category IV appliance produces positive vent pressure and very wet flue products at a temperature too low for gravity venting. Category IV appliances require special gas vents, the type of which may be furnished or specified by the appliance manufacturer. There is no other choice.\n\nAn inspection cap located at the base of the vent or a chimney cleanout opening provides the most convenient means of enabling inspection and cleanout of blocked venting systems. Incorrectly sized vent caps have also been known to contribute to spillage problems. Check the size and capacity of vent caps carefully, and install only caps and base-tees certified for use with the manufacturer's venting system. Vents and vent connectors require correct sizing with proper allowance for elbows and fittings. Keep the length of lateral runs to a minimum, and pitch these upward to promote effective venting.",

          "content": "Chapter 6 covers combustion air requirements. CSA B149.1 provides four tables for sizing air supply ducts. Table 8.1 is for combustion/dilution air requirements for appliances having draft-control devices when the combined input is up to and including 400,000 Btu/h (120 kW) and the structure complies with Clause 8.2.1 a) or b) (tightly constructed). Table 8.2 is for combustion air requirements for appliances not having draft control devices when the combined input is up to and including 400,000 Btu/h (120 kW) and the structure complies with Clause 8.2.1 a) or b) (tightly constructed). Table 8.3 is for combustion/dilution air requirements for appliances having draft control devices when the combined input is up to and including 400,000 Btu/h (120 kW) and the structure does not comply with Clause 8.2.1 a) or b) (not tightly constructed). Table 8.4 is for combustion air requirements for appliances not having draft control devices when the combined input is up to and including 400,000 Btu/h (120 kW) and the structure does not comply with Clause 8.2.1 a) or b) (not tightly constructed).\n\nCheck these questions before selecting the appropriate table: Is the building tightly constructed? Does the equipment have a draft-hood or other draft control device?\n\nAn outside air supply must always be provided to gas appliances that are installed in buildings with a tight envelope (buildings that do not permit air infiltration from outside). If all of the appliances are equipped with draft control devices, use Table 8.1. When all appliances operate without draft control, use Table 8.2. When there is a combination of draft control and non-draft control appliances installed in the same airtight building, Clause 8.2.5 states to determine the free area as the greater of: that required by Table 8.1 using the total input of only those appliances having draft-control devices, or that required by Table 8.2 using the total input of all appliances.\n\nNon-airtight buildings (leaky or normal buildings that are not extremely airtight) include some new housing as well as existing buildings - those that do not conform to CSA B149.1 Clause 8.2.1 a) or b). The requirements for outside air supply for such buildings are based on the combined input of the appliances, their draft control characteristics, and the volume of the structure. If the structure has a large enough volume, sufficient air supply is delivered through normal air leakage and no additional openings are required.\n\nWhen all appliances have draft control devices in non-airtight buildings, use Table 8.3. When all appliances operate without draft control, use Table 8.4. When there is a combination of draft control and non-draft control appliances installed in a leaky building, calculate the air supply by totaling the inputs of the appliances with draft control, then refer to Table 8.3 under the appropriate structure volume. Then calculate the total input of all appliances with both draft control and non-draft control, now referring to Table 8.4. Whichever is the greater of the air supply requirements shown is the one used.\n\nWhere gas appliances are installed in an enclosure within the building, Clause 8.2.6 allows the entire volume of the structure to be used in the tables if openings are provided in the partition separating the enclosure from the building. Free area required is 1 in² per 1000 Btu/h. Locate the opening between 6 and 18 in (150 and 450 mm) above floor level. Since appliances are equipped with draft control devices, the Code requires an additional opening of the same size located as close to the ceiling as practical and always above the relief opening of the draft control device. This opening is required to ventilate the room and stop a heat build up that could affect the safe operation of the draft control device.\n\nWhere openings cannot be made in the enclosure (conditions such as excessive dust or enclosed appliances within very small structure), a separate outside air supply must be supplied. In cold climates, consider providing an outside air supply duct with insulation and a vapor barrier to minimize condensation on the outside surface of the duct. If cold air becomes a comfort problem, certified automatic and interlocked dampers are available. Some jurisdictions encourage the use of a P trap in the air supply duct to inhibit the flow of heated air out of the air supply duct when the combustion equipment is not firing.\n\nAir requirements for installations over 400 MBtu/h (120 kW) are covered by Clause 8.4 of CSA B149.1. The air requirements fall into two categories: ventilation air and combustion air supply. Ventilation air openings are supplied to an enclosure or structure containing gas-fired appliances to allow free circulation of air. This permits excess heat or combustion products spilled at the draft-hood to ventilate to the outdoors through natural convection. Clause 8.4.1 specifies that ventilation of the space shall be provided by an opening at the highest practicable point communicating with the outdoors, not terminating within 12 in (300 mm) of any combustion air opening. The total cross-sectional area of such an opening shall be at least 10% of the area required in Clauses 8.4.2 and 8.4.3, but in no case shall the cross-sectional area be less than 10 in² (6500 mm²).\n\nCombustion air supply can be accomplished by using a system of ductwork or an opening in the outside wall. Equipment can be divided into two general categories: appliances with natural draft or fan-assisted burner, and appliances with a power burner. Equipment with a draft control device requires air supply at a ratio of 30:1, while equipment with no draft control requires air supply at a ratio of 15:1.\n\nClause 8.4.2 indicates for equipment with natural draft or fan-assisted burners with draft control device, there shall be a permanent air-supply opening having a cross-sectional area of not less than 1 in²/7000 Btu/h (310 mm²/kW) up to and including 1,000,000 Btu/h (300 kW), plus 1 in²/14,000 Btu/h (155 mm²/kW) in excess of 1,000,000 Btu/h (300 kW). This opening shall be located at or ducted to a point not more than 18 in (450 mm) or less than 6 in (150 mm) above the floor level. This air-supply opening requirement shall be in addition to the opening for ventilation air required in Clause 8.4.1.\n\nFor equipment with a power burner (Clause 8.4.3), there shall be a permanent air supply opening having a minimum cross-sectional area of 1 in² per 30 MBtu/h (70 mm²/kW) of burner input. For structures containing both natural draft or fan assisted burners and power burners, Clause 8.4.4 prescribes that the cross-sectional area of the opening(s) be at least the total area required for both types. Calculate the requirements for equipment falling under Clause 8.4.2 and add these to the requirements for equipment under Clause 8.4.3 to find the total requirements. Such requirements must be in addition to the air opening for ventilation air.\n\nAir supply requirements for a direct vent appliance are determined using manufacturer's instructions. The minimum required free area of a square combustion air opening is 10 in² (6500 mm²). The combustion air supply for a less than 400 MBtu/h installation must terminate within 4 ft (1.2 m) above, and within 5 ft (1.5 m) horizontally from the burner level of the appliance having the largest input. The smallest opening dimension in a fixed louvre, grille, or screen is 1/4 in (6.4 mm). A gas-fired appliance can be installed in a building without a separate combustion air supply under the condition of a loose building of sufficient volume. The minimum cross-sectional area of the ventilation air opening for an appliance over 400 MBtu/h compared to the air supply opening is 10% or 10 in².\n\nPractice problems cover various scenarios including single-family dwellings and structures with tight or loose construction, boilers and hot water tanks with or without draft control devices, air supply brought from outdoors through ducts, enclosures within structures, mechanical rooms with multiple appliances, and calculations for free area of air supply openings and ventilation openings.",

Special sealed \nventing systems are required due to the positive pressure.\nCategory IV Appliances\nHigh-Efficiency Design\nCategory IV includes high-efficiency, condensing-type appliances\nPositive Pressure\nOperates with positive pressure in the vent system\nCondensing Operation\nLess than 17% flue loss (greater than 83% efficient), water \ncollects within the appliance or vent\nCanadian Requirement\nAll forced air gas-fired furnaces manufactured or sold in \nCanada since January 1, 2010, are required to be high-\nefficiency, condensing-type appliances\nUnderstanding Draft\nDraft is the flow of air or combustion gas products (or a combination of \nthe two) through an appliance and its venting system. It is indicated by \nthe difference between the pressure at a specific point in the appliance \nor the venting system and the pressure of the air at the same elevation \noutside the appliance or the venting system.\nThe diagram above illustrates how draft works in a venting system, \nshowing the pressure differences that create the flow of combustion \ngases.\nAir/Gas Ratios\n10 ft³\nCombustion Air\nRequired per 1000 Btu produced\n30 ft³\nTotal Air\nMay be required per 1000 Btu\n0.02 in\nCritical Pressure\nNegative pressure limit for safe \noperation\nAir is required for the combustion process to meet three requirements: air for combustion, dilution air for the draft diverter, \nand air for ventilation. To meet these requirements, for every 1000 Btu (0.293 kW) produced by burning natural gas or \npropane, up to 30 ft³ (0.84 m³) of air may be required. Additional air may be needed to compensate for the operation of range \nhoods, clothes dryers, and exhaust fans, which can cause a negative pressure condition in the building. A negative pressure of \nmore than 0.02 inch w.c. (5 Pa) can cause natural draft appliances to spill the products of combustion into the building.\nTypes of Draft\nNatural Draft\nIt is a draft other than mechanical draft. For example, a draft \ncan be developed by the difference in temperature of hot \ngases in a vent or chimney and outdoor air temperature.\nThe natural-draft vent, or gravity vent, relies on the upward \nmovement of hot gases creating a slight negative pressure \nin the vent or chimney. Blowers are not needed to assist \ndraft with a gravity vent.\nMechanical Draft\nIt is the draft that a mechanical device (e.g., fan, blower, \naspirator) produces and that may supplement natural draft.\nIts two main types are:\n•\nForced draft - a product of a mechanical device \nupstream from the combustion zone of an appliance\n•\nInduced draft - a product of a mechanical device \ndownstream from the combustion zone of an appliance\nDraft Effects: Downdraft\nDowndraft (also called backdraft) is a condition of the venting system in \nwhich a draft is reversed down and can cause products of combustion to \nspill.\nThis diagram illustrates how downdraft can occur in a venting system, \ncausing combustion products to spill into the living space instead of \nbeing safely vented outdoors. This is a dangerous condition that can lead \nto carbon monoxide exposure.\nDraft Effects: Stack Effect\nHeat Generation\nCombustion creates hot gases\nTemperature Difference\nHot gases are less dense than surrounding air\nUpward Movement\nLess dense gases rise through the vertical passage\nContinuous Flow\nCreates ongoing draft as long as temperature difference exists\nStack effect is the tendency of heated gas to rise in a vertical passage such as a chimney, a small enclosure, or a stairwell. This natural phenomenon is the principle behind natural draft \nventing systems.\nDraft Effects: Wind Effect\nWind Movement\nAir flows across vent termination\nPressure Change\nCreates negative (suction) pressure \nat termination\nIncreased Draft\nEnhances upward flow of combustion \ngases\nEddy Currents\nCan create variable pressure \nconditions\nWind effect is the likelihood of negative (suction) pressure at the vent termination that will increase draft to result from wind \nand eddy currents. This effect can enhance the performance of a venting system but can also cause issues if not properly \naccounted for in the system design.\nOver-fire Pressure\nDefinition\nOver-fire draft is the pressure measured over the flame in \nthe combustion chamber compared to the pressure of \nthe outside of the combustion chamber.\nPositive Over-fire Draft\nHas a positive pressure over the fire\nNegative Over-fire Draft\nHas a negative pressure over the fire\nNeutral Over-fire Draft\nHas a neutral pressure over the fire\nTo prevent flue gas spillage, ensure that the heat exchanger and any portion of the venting system that is under positive \npressure have sealing.\nTheoretical Stack Draft\nThe quantity of theoretical draft in a stack, measured in inches of water \ncolumn (or in Pascals), is directly proportional to the absolute \ntemperature difference between the stack gas and its surroundings, and \nto the height of the stack. Draft does not depend on the diameter of the \nstack.\nStack Temperature\nDraft will be greatest when \naverage stack temperature \nis highest\nOutdoor Temperature\nDraft will be greatest when \noutdoor air temperature is \nlowest\nStack Height\nDraft will be greatest when stack height is greatest\nTheoretical Stack Draft Formula\nImperial Formula\nD = 7.6 × H × (1/Ta - 1/Ts)\nWhere:\n•\nD = theoretical draft (inches w.c.)\n•\nTs = average stack temperature (°R)\n•\nTa = outside temperature (°R)\n•\nH = stack height (ft)\n•\n7.6 = constant\nMetric Formula\nD = 3450 × H × (1/Ta - 1/Ts)\nWhere:\n•\nD = theoretical draft (Pa)\n•\nTs = average stack temperature (K)\n•\nTa = outside temperature (K)\n•\nH = stack height (m)\n•\n3450 = constant\nTo take into account the heat lost through the stack walls as the hot gases pass through the stack, the average stack \ntemperature (Ts) is the point halfway between the inlet temperature at the bottom and the outlet temperature at the top of \nthe stack.\nVent Gas Temperature\n1\nHigher Temperature\nHotter vent gases are lighter\nGreater Force\nCreates stronger expulsion through vent\n3\nBetter Performance\nResults in more effective venting\nSince the temperatu",
