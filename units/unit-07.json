          "content": "Overview\n\nPurpose\nA customer will feel safe and secure when they are confident that a service technician can solve their problem. A gas technician/fitter must always maintain a professional attitude and use effective communication techniques when dealing with customers.\n\nObjectives\nAt the end of this Chapter, you will be able to\n• employ professional standards and behaviour; and\n• use effective communication.\n\nTerminology\n- Active listening: Total listening (\"listening\" to both words and non-verbal communication)\n- Effective communication: Clear communication (including non verbal)\n\nProfessional standards and behaviours\n\nAttitude\nA customer will feel safe and secure when they are confident that you can solve their problem. Your own confidence in your technical skills and knowledge, and a professional manner will increase a customer's sense of confidence and security.\n\nThe following will help you to project professionalism.\n\nDo:\n• Always show respect toward the customer\n• Explain problems in an easy-to-understand way\n\nDo not/never:\n• Do not \"speak down\" to a customer\n\nEveryone wants respect from other people. When dealing with customers, remember that a person being told about their faults, failures, and shortcomings can be hurtful and offensive. Treat your customers with the same respect that you would like to receive.\n\nRemember that customers may not understand the technical aspects of your work. Explain the technical aspects in simple terms, and make sure you are not condescending in tone or explanation.\n\nExample:\nIf a customer's thermostat needs to be adjusted or repaired, give a simple explanation of the thermostat's function and the problem.\n1) First, note that the thermostat is a device that senses temperature changes and switches the furnace on and off to maintain the desired temperature in an area of the building.\n2) Second, inform the customer, in terms that they can easily understand, about what needs be to adjusted or repaired.\n\nAppearance\nA neat, well-groomed appearance conveys to customers that your work is of high quality. To be professional, you must look professional.\n\nTake note of the following:\n• Uniforms and clothing should always fit well and be clean.\n• Hair must be clean and well-groomed.\n• Facial hair must be well-maintained. Neatly trim your beard or mustache if you have one.\n\nExample:\nA gas technician/fitter arrives at a customer's home unshowered, unshaven, wearing soiled, wrinkled clothing and dirty footwear. Most customers would understandably be concerned about the quality of work from someone who arrives in such a condition. An untidy appearance communicates a lack of self-respect as well as a lack of respect for the customer.\n\nWorkplace behaviour\nAs a representative of your company, you must always be aware of the impression you convey. Your behaviour while working on a customer's premises is an important part of your customer service responsibilities.\n\nThis list of dos and don'ts outlines the basic rules of workplace etiquette that all service technicians should abide by.\n\nDo:\n• Ask permission before you move furniture or other items.\n• Alert the customer if you are going to cause a disturbance or make excessive noise.\n• Ask permission before you use any utility (water, power, etc.).\n• Clean up any mess or waste created by your work.\n\nDo not/never:\n• Do not wander about a customer's premises.\n• Do not eat or smoke on a customer's premises.\n• Do not help yourself to beverages.\n• Do not disrupt the work of other personnel on the premises.\n• Do not use a customer's telephone without permission.\n• Do not leave equipment (or the premises) in disarray if you have to leave the building to get supplies or tools.\n• Do not create hazards by leaving equipment or materials unattended.\n• Do not leave tools or your toolbox on appliances (doing so may scratch the surface).\n\nUnacceptable behaviour\nCertain types of behaviour are always unacceptable when dealing with a customer and working on their property, including smoking, horseplay, harassment, profanity, and criticism of a customer's home or belongings.\n\nWhen to refer to higher authority\nAt times, you may encounter questions from a customer which you cannot answer or which are beyond the scope of your authority. In these cases, refer the customer to a senior crew member (if present), or a supervisory staff member.\n\nSome of these questions may be about\n• non-technical matters;\n• terms of a contract;\n• terms of a warranty; or\n• safety issues with installation.\n\nEffective communication\n\nCommunication strategies\nWhen listening to a customer's questions or concerns, use the following techniques to establish and maintain good communication.\n• Maintain eye contact while talking and taking notes. This will help you to stay focused on what the customer is saying.\n• If you are in a noisy or crowded environment, suggest moving to a quieter location so you can talk more easily.\n• Avoid interrupting the customer. Be patient and allow the customer to finish speaking before you respond.\n• Acknowledge the customer's concerns and be sympathetic about the problem or request.\n• Ask for clarification, if necessary, so that the correct information is conveyed. Do not be afraid to ask for the relevant service manual. (It is impossible to retain all the specific information about every appliance — this is why manuals stay with appliances.)\n• Take notes to share with supervisory staff and other relevant parties.\n• Use layperson's terms, and ensure that the customer understands what you have said before you start talking about a new topic.\n• Recap or summarize the customer's explanation of the problem or ask further questions to clarify your understanding.\n• Ensure that the customer agrees to any corrective actions before you commence work.\n\nFirst contact with a customer\nAs soon as you arrive at a customer's premises, determine what the problem is; to do so, ask why the customer called for service.\n\nA good way to continue is to ask the customer to describe the problem. You need to know what the customer saw, heard, touched, or smelled that indicated a problem as well as when and where this occurred. Make sure to listen closely to their answers. Customers (or operators) can often lead you directly to the problem (which saves both of you time and money).\n\nIt is important to accurately determine what the problem is. If necessary, continue to ask questions until you have gathered all of the facts.\n\nExample:\nThe best approach to a problem is to ask the right questions in the right way.\n\nFor example, Ms. McNeil called for furnace service, but there is no description of the problem or its symptoms on your service order.\n\nYour first question to Ms. McNeil should be something like,\n\"Ms. McNeil, I understand that you have a problem with your furnace. Could you describe what kind of problem you are having?\"\n\nThis kind of question is very useful for getting the information you need to understand the problem. Asking the right questions can make all the difference.\n\nInstead of the question above, you could have asked,\n\"Ms. McNeil, I understand that you have a problem with your furnace. Could you please show me where the furnace is?\"\n\nIf you had asked this question, although you would now know where to find the furnace, you would be no further ahead in terms of discovering what the actual problem is. Customer input is an important first step in troubleshooting problems: you get the information you need, and the customer is brought into the process. It is a win-win situation for all parties.\n\nInforming the customer\nOnce you have identified (and solved) the problem, it is important to inform the customer — in terms they can easily understand — what the problem was and how it was resolved.\n\nMaintaining a customer's sense of safety and security is an important part of customer relations. Fears and concerns are usually based on personal experience, and you should take them seriously — but also use the facts of the situation to alleviate a customer's fears and concerns. Most customers are not familiar with the technical aspects of the gas trade, so they depend on your expertise. A simple explanation goes a long way toward ensuring a customer's sense of well- being and comfort.\n\nExample:\nUnusual or loud noises, the smell of gas, and appliance failure can be very distressing for a customer.\n\nMr. Singh has placed an emergency call for service because his furnace is periodically making loud noises. You arrive on the scene and find Mr. Singh visibly distressed. The previous week, a suspected gas explosion destroyed a house in Mr. Singh's town.\n\nAfter investigating the problem, you discover that the flame on the furnace pilot burner is too small. You change the pilot filter, adjust the pilot flame, test the ignition, and put the furnace back in operation, yet the customer is still fearful. In this situation, before you leave, make sure you assure the customer that the issue has been resolved and that there is no ongoing danger. The best way to do this is to give a brief, clear explanation of the problem, as shown below.\n\n\"Mr. Singh, I discovered that the pilot light on your furnace was not functioning properly. When this happens, the main burner does not light quickly, and there is delayed ignition. The pilot assembly was dirty, so I replaced it with a new, clean assembly. I have tested the furnace, and the ignition is now safe and reliable.\"\n\nThrough good communication and effective customer service, you will show yourself in a positive light, and the company you represent will reap the benefits in their bottom line.",

          "content": "Overview\n\nPurpose\nA customer's confidence (and your own professional image) is enhanced when you show respect for yourself and a customer's property. This Chapter outlines how a gas technician/fitter can act to prevent damage to property.\n\nObjectives\nAt the end of this Chapter, you will be able to describe the ways a gas technician/fitter can act to prevent property damage.\n\nTerminology\n- Professionalism: Conducting yourself responsibly, with integrity and accountability; upholding excellent standards\n\nMethods of preventing property damage\n\nThe following are some of the more basic ways to behave professionally and show respect for a customer's property.\n• Properly park and secure your vehicle.\n• Display professionalism through personal cleanliness.\n• Use tools and equipment properly.\n• Handle and install appliances properly.\n• Use your own (not a customer's) tools and equipment.\n• Clean up after you complete your work.\n\nParking and properly securing vehicles\nOne way to ensure good customer relations is by observing proper vehicle etiquette. Doing so also projects personal and corporate professionalism to the public as a whole.\n\nPark service vehicles on the street, not in a customer's driveway. This is good practice for several reasons.\n\nFor example,\n• street parking makes the vehicle more visible to the public, which is good advertising;\n• street parking means there is no chance of you accidentally damaging toys, bicycles, or other objects in a driveway;\n• street parking means oil or other spills from your vehicle will not damage a customer's property; and\n• street parking means children are less likely to enter or damage your vehicle (especially because it is locked).\n\nDisplaying professionalism\nEnsure that your hands and clothes are as clean as possible. Dirty hands and clothes not only present a poor image of both you and your company, they can also soil and damage a customer's premises and furnishings.\n\nDirty footwear can soil and damage carpets and floors. It is best to wear overshoes. Although it is common to take off footwear inside the home, safety boots are a part of personal protective equipment (PPE), so should not be removed.\n\nProper use of tools and equipment\nPrevent damage to a customer's property by carefully handling tools and equipment. Follow the guidelines below.\n\nDo:\n• Use care and caution when carrying tools and equipment into and out of the premises.\n• When necessary, use padding to protect floors, appliances, and furnishings.\n• Keep a fire extinguisher close at hand when using a torch.\n\nDo not/never:\n• Do not place tools or equipment on a customer's appliances, furniture, or any other object or surface that may be damaged.\n• Do not place magnetic flashlights or tools on a customer's appliance (or similar) as these can scratch metal surfaces.\n• Do not unplug any of a customer's appliances to obtain power for your own purposes. In particular, do not unplug a refrigerator or freezer (as customers can claim damages in case of spoiled food).\n• Do not leave a trouble light turned on when it is on the floor or near flammable materials. (A trouble light can overheat, cause fire, and discolour surfaces.)\n• Do not leave burning torches unattended as these can easily tip over and cause fire.\n\nProper handling and installation of appliances\nBefore you install an appliance, take careful measurements to ensure that it will fit into the space provided and that there is adequate door, hall, and stairway clearance as well as space to manoeuvre. Adequate space will ensure ease of installation and reduce the possibility of damaging a customer's property.\n\nMake an assessment of what needs to be done and devise a plan to complete the installation safely with no damage to equipment or the customer's property. You may need help from a colleague — some jobs, to complete safely, require two people.\n\nWhen moving an appliance, you can do the following to prevent damage to walls and floors.\n• Use protective pads.\n• Use carts (with wheels) or dollies.\n• Walk an appliance in small steps (rather than pushing or dragging it).\n• Wrap the appliance in moving blankets.\n• Use protective floor coverings.\n\nUsing a customer's tools or equipment\nIt is not acceptable to use a customer's tools or equipment. Indeed, doing so communicates unprofessionalism.\n\nIn addition, a customer's tools or equipment\n• may be inferior quality, in poor condition, or unsuitable for the job;\n• may break or malfunction (causing damage or personal injury that could result in an insurance claim or lawsuit); and\n• may be lost or damaged in the course of doing your work (and need replacement).\n\nAlways use your own extension cords (certified for the task).\n\nDo not unplug a customer's appliance (particularly a refrigerator or freezer) to use an outlet for your own purposes. However — if this is your only option — ask the customer for permission to do so. In these cases, it is a good idea to tie your extension cord to the customer's (unplugged) power cord. This will remind you to plug in the customer's appliance when you finish. (Doing so will also help to avoid potential insurance claims and lawsuits directed at you or your company.)\n\nCleaning up\nIt is necessary to clean up the area where you have been working.\n\nA proper clean up involves\n• cleaning up spills;\n• only using solvents if they will not cause damage;\n• removing and disposing of cleaning rags, cloths, etc.;\n• cleaning up excess flux and solder after soldering; and\n• removing all crating and packaging materials.\n\nAfter you clean up, walk around and make sure you have not left any tools behind. You should aim to leave the area cleaner than it was when you arrived.\n\nIf an incident occurs that causes damage to a customer's property, immediately report it to the customer and your supervisor.\n\nNote: Do not leave equipment or parts (such as parts of a furnace) behind. Doing so leaves you open to customers making damage claims.",

Ask them to show you the way to the furnace, thermostat, etc. This strategy ends the conversation with a practical question, in a way that continues to respect the dignity of the customer.\n\nOption 2\nAnother option is to turn the topic of conversation towards the specific problem that the customer has asked you to solve then ask a question or make a statement that prompts action by the customer. This strategy should allow you to get on with the job without disrespecting the customer.\n\nExample:\nThis example shows one method of dealing with a talkative customer. This customer, Mrs. Petrov, insists on talking to you excessively and is preventing you from working on the actual problem at hand.\n\nIn a case like this, you might say\n\"Mrs. Petrov, I understand that you have a problem with your furnace. You said that the house is not warming up to the temperature you set on the thermostat. I can solve that problem for you right now. Can you show me where the thermostat is located?\"\n\nThis method ends the conversation by asking a practical question that asks for input from Mrs. Petrov while also respecting her dignity and allowing you to focus on your job.\n\nThe unresponsive customer\nSome people are naturally shy and passive. If a customer is unresponsive and has little to say, you can try asking an \"open-ended question\" to get you the information you need. (An open-ended question is a question that requires a full answer — not just \"yes\" or \"no\".)\n\nFor example, you could ask one of the following.\n\"What problem are you experiencing?\"\n\"How did this happen?\"\n\"What can I do to help?\"\n\"When did you notice the issue with your furnace?\"\n\nThe obstinate customer\nIf a customer continues to be obstinate and uncooperative and you are having trouble coming to an agreement, make comments that are explicit about finding a solution.\n\nThe following are some possibilities.\n\"What would you like me to do now, [name of customer]?\"\n\"What do you think would be a good way to solve this problem?\"\n\"What can I do to make you happy?\"\n\nIn response to such questions, a customer may be less demanding than you expect. However, if you still cannot reach agreement, you should seek the help of your supervisor.\n\nThe whining customer\nOccasionally, you may encounter a \"whining\" customer — a person who tells other people all about their negative feelings, hurts, and disappointments. They may complain about how late you are or about how someone else in your company was rude to them. To respond to whining customers, you can ask the following questions.\n\"How could we have served you better?\"\n\"How would you like things to be handled differently next time?\"\n\nNote: If you know you will arrive later than scheduled, you should call ahead or ask your dispatcher to. (If appropriate, inform the customer that you received an emergency call, which is of higher priority than a no-heat call.) Customers appreciate being \"in the know\". Calling ahead also means the customer gets a feel for who is coming to their home, which can lower their anxiety.\n\nThe rude customer\nThe main strategy to use when dealing with a rude customer is to \"keep your cool\". Smile in a friendly, inoffensive way and try asking one of the following questions.\n\"What would you like me to do to solve this problem?\"\n\"I can see that I am not meeting your expectations. What can I do differently?\"\n\nThe customer who is suppressing their anger\nIt is difficult to communicate with people who suppress (\"bottle up\") their anger. Although their words may not communicate their anger, their tone of their voice probably will. Before establishing meaningful communication with these customers, allow them to express their anger.\n\nTo do so, try the following.\n\nSay \"what you see\".\n\"You are obviously very concerned about what has happened.\"\n\"You have every right to be upset about this.\"\n\nTry to get the customer to talk about what is bothering them.\n\"How do you feel about this?\"\n\"What was your reaction when this happened?\"\n\nAfter a customer has had the chance to express their anger, you can move on to questions that will allow you to proceed with solving their problem.\n\nThe hostile customer\nYou cannot communicate with a customer who is shouting. First, wait until they have calmed down. In the meantime, there are several things you can do to manage the situation.\n• Listen actively and attentively, and let the customer continue until their anger has subsided.\n• Maintain eye contact and a sympathetic facial expression.\n• Use positive body language and an open, friendly posture.\n• Always stay back at least 3 ft (1 m) so as not to violate a customer's personal space. This is especially true at the front door when you first make contact with a customer.\n• When you speak, use phrases that communicate empathy, such as those beginning with, \"Yes, I see\".\n• When circumstances allow, summarize what the customer expressed and restate the reason for their anger. Say, \"Based on what you told me, this is what I understand\". This will ensure that both you and the customer understand the situation.\n• Identify the problem and try to maintain focus on it.\n• When it becomes possible, move on to asking the customer questions that will allow you to get on with the job. For example, \"What can I do to help solve this problem?\"\n\nThe intoxicated customer or the customer who is using profane language\nAs a service technician, you should never accept a customer verbally abusing or being violent toward you. However, you may sometimes find yourself, unwittingly, in such a situation. If this occurs, you can use the following strategies.\n\nIf a customer is abusive, you can say the following statements.\n\"I am sorry, but if you cannot speak to me professionally. I will have to call my supervisor.\"\n\"I am sorry, but if you cannot speak to me professionally, I will have to leave.\"\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of such an incident, make accurate notes for future reference. If another worker was present and witnessed the incident, ask them to review (and sign) your notes about the incident.\n\nNote: You must never accuse a customer of being intoxicated or under the influence of drugs. Such accusations can render you and your employer liable to legal action.\n\nHigh-risk situations\n\nAvoiding situations that put you at risk\nAlthough you should never deliberately put yourself in risky situations, as a gas service technician, you may inadvertently find yourself in situations that put you at risk.\n\nIndeed, the work of a gas technician/fitter affects others' basic survival. Answering a no-heat call on a cold evening puts you face-to-face with customers who are depending on your action and assistance for their family's safety and survival. Understanding a customer's level of anxiety up front may help defuse tension.\n\nThe following circumstances may put you at risk.\n• Performing actions for which you could receive criticism (such as smoking or pretending to clean an-already clean furnace).\n• Entering a home in which young children or minors are alone and without adult supervision.\n• Being on a premises alone (without the presence of the customer or another representative).\n• Interacting with a customer who is obviously under the influence of alcohol or another substance.\n• Interacting with a customer who is abusive or unreasonable.\n\nDealing with violence\nThere may be occasions when an enraged customer confronts and threatens you or becomes violent. In such a situation, keep calm and find a way to leave the premises. If necessary, call 911.\n\nRecognizing potentially dangerous customers\nYou can learn to recognize potentially violent customers by reading a person's body language and other non-verbal communication.\n\nSpecifically, look for signs, such as\n• clenched fists and a tense body posture;\n• a red face, tight lips, flared nostrils, wide-open eyes;\n• an agitated and aggressive tone of voice; or\n• evidence of alcohol or drug use.\n\nIf a customer does become unruly or threatens you with violence, immediately seek assistance. You do not have to put up with threats of any sort.\n\nNever attempt to reason with a customer who is behaving in a threatening way, or who may be under the influence of alcohol or drugs. If there is a potential for violence, do not be embarrassed to call the police. It is better to risk embarrassment than to be a victim of violence.\n\nSpeak to your supervisor about what made you uncomfortable with this specific customer. Ask that their address be flagged and notes added indicating the risk — this is to ensure the safety of technicians who may attend calls at this address in the future. As a worker, you have a right to refuse unsafe work under occupational health and safety rules contained in OHSA, and your supervisor is aware of this right.\n\n(Different in nature, but similar in effect, are customers who make unwanted advances such as complimenting you on your looks, asking you out on a date, or offering you a tip — behaviour that may make you feel uncomfortable and unwilling to be alone with them.)\n\nPersonal safety tips\nRead the danger signs in your work environment.\n\nDo:\n• Ask your dispatcher to check company records if you suspect a customer has a history of being problematic or has a record of aggressive or violent behaviour.\n• If you feel threatened, move to a safe location. If necessary, you can return later with your supervisor or the police.\n• Immediately report all incidents of aggression or violence to your supervisor. Report all details in writing.\n• Be more cautious at night, as criminal activity and personal crime increase sharply at night.\n\nDo not/never:\n• Do not allow any situation to distract you from paying attention to what is going on around you. Perform occasional checks to make sure you are not being stalked or followed.\n• Do not make yourself an easy target for robbery. For example, do not openly flash cash or wear expensive jewelry.",

          "content": "Overview\n\nPurpose\nIn our multicultural society, there are many occasions when a gas technician/fitter will encounter someone who has a different cultural background to their own. This Chapter outlines some cultural differences that a gas technician/fitter may encounter and some strategies to employ in these circumstances.\n\nObjectives\nAt the end of this Chapter, you will be able to\n• describe cultural differences; and\n• describe strategies for overcoming cultural differences when they affect your work.\n\nTerminology\n- Cross culture: Interactions between members of different cultural groups\n- Limited English proficiency: Individuals who do not speak English as their primary language and who have a limited ability to use and understand English\n\nCultural differences\n\nEveryone — regardless of race, creed, or colour — deserves the same quality of service and treatment. In our multicultural society, there are many occasions when a service person will encounter someone of a different culture.\n\nHere are some aspects of culture to keep in mind\n• use of space and time;\n• religious history and practice;\n• values around work, property, family, and home;\n• values and expectations about gender and individual behaviour; and\n• clothing, food, and beverages.\n\nBarriers to cross-cultural communication\n\nHere are some potential barriers to positive cross-cultural communication\n• difficulty communicating due to language differences;\n• misinterpretation of non-verbal communication and body language;\n• lack of cultural awareness and ethnocentrism (only seeing the world from the perspective of your own culture);\n• different cultural norms and expectations or different value systems; and\n• stereotyping.\n\nOvercoming barriers to achieve positive cross-cultural communication\n\nCommon misconceptions about specific cultures can create challenges in cross-cultural communication. It is important to be able to identify mistaken perceptions and assumptions about other cultures in order to counter them. Communication with people from other cultures in conjunction with tolerance and understanding can go a long way toward overcoming cross-cultural barriers.\n\nIt is a good idea to read up on some of the different cultures you may encounter so you can have a better understanding of the cultural differences of people you will meet.\n\nDealing with customers who have limited English proficiency\n\nOne common problem when dealing with people of different cultures is the use of different languages.\n\nHowever, you can improve communication with customers who speak little or no English by doing the following.\n• Learn a few phrases of their language.\n• Use a translation app or website.\n• Identify those among your staff who speak different languages, and who could, therefore, help you. (You could even put their names on an easy-to-access list for quick referral.)\n• Practice slowing down your speech (but refrain from speaking more loudly).\n• Learn and use the customer's name. \"Mr. or Ms. [name], I know that you speak more than one language but, unfortunately, I only speak English. I want to help you ...\"\n• If you are communicating face-to-face, you can ask the customer to write their name and request. (After all, there are no accents to contend with in the written word.)\n\nOvercoming cultural differences that can affect work\n\nCultural differences and work\nSome possible cultural differences that may affect your work include\n• timelines and scheduling;\n• contractual details and consent;\n• payment terms and procedures;\n• expectations regarding service; and\n• access to a person's property.\n\nSuggested strategies to accommodate cultural differences\nYou may need to implement the following strategies in these circumstances.\n• Adjust work schedules to respect religious or cultural practices.\n• Make extra effort to explain your work and what the customer can expect.\n• Explain company policies and procedures and confirm agreement before you begin work.\n• Use an interpreter to resolve any misunderstandings. (Many customers will have a family member who speaks English.)\n• Acknowledge and observe rules of appropriate behaviour with respect to a customer's home or place of business. For example, do not use dismissive language or display looks of disgust to a customer.\n• In all cases, it is best to remain patient and polite. It also never hurts to pepper your communication with \"please\" and \"thank you\". Common courtesy can go a long way toward smoothing out challenges in customer relations.\n• Always aim to keep your words and communication simple: avoid technical jargon and complicated sentence structures. Just say what you mean as clearly and simply as possible.\n• When it is not clear to you what the other person is saying, seek clarification. Summarizing or paraphrasing can be really helpful in checking that you correctly understand what the other person has said. Try rephrasing their words and adding a simple question at the end.",

An untidy appearance indicates a lack of self-respect and a lack of respect for \nthe customer. \nWorkplace behaviour \nAs the representative of your company, you must always be aware of the impression you convey \nto the customer. An important part of your customer service responsibilities is your behaviour \nwhile working on the customer's premises.

In these cases, \nyou should refer the customer to a senior crew member (if present) or a supervisory staff member \nwho can answer the customer's question. \nSome of the issues that fall into this category are: \n• non-technical questions; \n• terms of contracts; \n• warranty terms; and \n• safety issues with the installation. \nMarch 2022 \n9\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 7 \nCustomer relations \nEffective communication \nommunication strategy \ntnethodology \nWhen listening to a customer's questions and concerns, you can employ the following active \nlistening and clarifying techniques to establish and maintain good communication: \n• Establishing eye contact while talking and taking notes, when necessary, will help you \nmaintain your focus on the customer's questions and comments. \n• If you are in a noisy or crowded environment, suggest moving to a location that is free from \nnoise and other distractions so that you and the customer can converse more easily. \n• Avoid interrupting the customer-show patience by letting the customer complete his or her \nexplanation before you respond. \n• Acknowledge the customer's concerns. \n• Be sympathetic to the customer's problem or request. \n• Ask for clarification on points raised so that correct information can be passed on if necessary. \nDon't be afraid to ask for the service manual. It is impossible to retain all the specific \ninformation about every appliance.

Make sure to listen closely to the customer's answers. \nCustomers and/or operators can often lead you to the problem, saving you time and them money. \nIt is important to accurately determine what the problem is. If necessary, you must continue to ask \nthe customer questions until you understand all the facts of the situation. \nExatnple \nThe best approach to a problem is to ask the right questions in the proper manner.

Some of the more \nobvious ways to accomplish these objectives are: \n• parking and securing your vehicle properly; \n• displaying professionalism through personal cleanliness; \n• using tools and equipment properly; \n• handling and installing appliances properly; \n• not using a customer's tools or equipment; and \n• cleaning up after the work is complete. \nParking and securing vehicles properly \nPracticing proper vehicle etiquette is a means of maintaining good customer relations and \nprojects a personal and corporate professional image to the public at large. \nPark service vehicles on the street, not in the customer's driveway. This is a good practice for \nseveral reasons: \n• It makes the vehicle more visible to the public-which is a good advertisement. \n• There is no chance of damaging toys, bicycles, or other objects on the driveway. \n• Any oil or fluid spills from your vehicle will not damage the customer's property. \n• Children will be less likely to enter or damage the vehicle, especially if it is locked. \nDisplaying professionalism through personal \ncleanliness \nEnsure that your hands and clothing are as clean as possible. Dirty hands and clothing not only \npresent a poor visual image of both you and the company to the customer, they can also soil and \ndamage the customer's home and furnishings. \nDirty footwear can soil and damage carpets and floors. It is good practice to wear overshoes or \nboots that you can easily remove.

Dealing with difficult customers \nOverview \nPurpose \nGenerally, when arriving at a service call, a gas technician/fitter can expect the customer to be \nirritable and concerned, rather than warm and friendly. For this reason, gas technicians/fitters \nwork in potentially hostile environments. In order to deal with customer-related problems in an \neffective manner, the technician/fitter must be able to recognize and handle difficult situations. \nThis Chapter covers the basic skills that are vital for identifying and dealing with difficult \ncustomers and situations. \nObjectives \nAt the end of this Chapter, you will be able to: \n• describe how to deal with customer complaints; \n• describe techniques for dealing with difficult customers; \n• identify types of difficult customers; and \n• identify high-risk situations. \nTerminology \nTerm \nAbbreviation \nDefinition \n(symbol) \nNon-verbal communication \nSending and receiving messages through facial \nexpression, tone of voice, and body language \nVerbal communication \nSending and receiving messages through \nwords \nDealing with customer complaints \nCalming upset customers \nA spirit of cooperation can help solve every problem. Using the cooperative approach, you and \nthe customer should usually be able to come up with a win-win solution to the problem. \nAn upset customer is different from a difficult customer. An upset customer may have moments of \nunreasonable behaviour, but still be basically rational. On the other hand, difficult people are \nchronically hard to communicate with as a result of a psychological need to get attention through \ndisruptive and negative means. Some customers will insist on being unreasonable no matter \nMarch 2022 \n19\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 7 \nCustomer relations \nwhat you do for them. You must have patience. On these occasions, you would be well-advised \nto call in your supervisor. \nLet's consider some of the reasons customer interactions go wrong and may become more \n\"difficult\". \nReason \nWhy they may become more \"difficult\" \nYou seem not to care. \nYou don't sound or look as if you care, are concerned, or \nappreciate the customer's situation. Although you may \ncare, you really need to say caring words and look and \nsound as if you care. After all, the customer can't read \nyour mind. \nYou don't listen. \nToo often we try to jump in with solutions and don't allow \nthe customer to vent their feelings. Again, you need to \nshow the customer that you're listening by your body \nlanguage as well as what you say and how you say it. \nYou let the customer \"get to you\". \nSometimes we allow the customer's attitude to irritate or \nannoy us. When this becomes obvious to the customer, \nagain through our tone of voice or body language, it only \nfuels bad feelings. \nYou use the wrong words. \nThere are certain trigger words that cause a customer to \nbecome more difficult. Some of these are \"can't, have to, \nsorry about that\". Even industry jargon can have a \nnegative effect on a customer interaction. \nYou don't see it from the \nToo often service personnel think the customer is making \ncustomer's point of view. \ntoo much of a fuss. \nCustomers will often judge the level of your service based on how well you recover from a difficult \nsituation. They are very likely to forgive you if you end the interaction on a positive note. \nt \nAn upset customer wants four basic things: \n. Customers expect. .. \nTo meet the expectation ... \nSomeone to listen to them \nUse effective listening techniques to assure the \ncustomer of your attentiveness to the problem. \nSomeone to treat them with respect \nDo not be arrogant or condescending in your words or \nactions. \nSomeone to take their problem \nRespond to the customer in a confident, serious, \nseriously \nprofessional manner. \nSomeone to solve their problem \nAct as quickly as circumstances permit to solve the \nimmediately \ncustomer's problem. \n20 \nMarch 2022\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 7 \nCustomer relations \nFocus on the problem \n• Determine whether the customer is more interested in having someone listen to them or in \nimmediate action, and respond appropriately. In all discussions with difficult customers, focus \non the problem and its solution and not on the persons involved. \n• Do not encourage or agree with a customer who criticizes your company or its management. \n• Identify the cause of the customer's distress and recap it to show your understanding. \nResolve the problem \n• Propose a solution to the problem and discuss it with the customer. \n• Confirm that the proposed solution is acceptable to the customer. \n• Have the customer sign an authorization form before commencing work. \n• Perform a follow-up after the work is complete to ensure the customer is still satisfied. \nSteps to resolving a problem \nYou can use the following step-by-step techniques to help calm an upset customer and resolve \ntheir problem at the same time: \n1) \nListen to the customer. \n2) \nShow empathy with the customer. \n3) \nClarify the problem. \n4) \nDevelop a cooperative approach to the problem. \nStep 1-Listen to the customer \nPractice and use these listening techniques to assist you in dealing effectively with all customers, \nnot just the difficult ones: \nMarch 2022 \n21\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 7 \nCustomer relations \nDo ... \nDo not/never ... \n.

You can let them know that you \nunderstand why they are upset by using the proper words to respond to them. \n22 \nMarch 2022\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 7 \nCustomer relations \nUnacceptable response \nGood way to respond \n\"You are crazy.\" \n\"I appreciate what you are saying.\" \n\"I know how you feel.\" \n\"I can understand why you feel that way\" or \"I can \nunderstand how that would be annoying for you.\" \n\"Boy, are you mad.\" \n\"I can see how you would be upset.\" \n\"I don't know why you are so \n\"If it were me, I would be upset too\" or \"I am sorry for the \nupset.\" \ninconvenience we have caused.\" \nBefore you can solve a customer's problem, you must fully understand what it is. Paraphrase or \nrecap what he or she tells you to give assurance that you know what the customer is trying to say. \nUnacceptable response \nGood way to respond \n\"You're way off base.\" \n\"What it sounds like you are saying is ... \" \n\"You are not making any sense.\" \n\"Maybe I am not understanding you correctly.\" \n\"That is definitely wrong.\" \n\"Let me see if I have this straight.\" \n\"Did you really say .... \" \n\"This is what I understood you to say.\" \nStep 4-Develop a cooperative approach to the problern \nWhen you can get the customer to cooperate with you, it is much easier to identify and solve a \nproblem. Using effective language will help develop a spirit of cooperation between you and the \ncustomer. \nUnacceptable response \nGood way to respond \n\"We can't do that.\" \n\"I would like to help you find a solution to the problem.\" \n\"You certainly have a problem.\" \n\"Let's see what we can do together to work out a solution to \nthis problem.\" \nPreventable situations \nYou are unable to control the behaviour of an upset or difficult customer, but you can ensure that \nyour own behaviour does not cause them further annoyance. \nSometimes, you or someone else in your company may be responsible for causing a customer to \nbe upset.

In our multicultural society, there are many occasions when a service person will \nencounter someone of a different culture. Some of the issues that define cultural differences \ninclude: \n• use of space and time; \n• religious history and practices; \n• work, property, family, and home values; \n• gender and personal values and expectations; and \n• traditional dress, food, and beverages. \nBarriers to cross-cultural communication \nSome of the barriers to cross-cultural communication and understanding include: \n• language and non-verbal communication patterns; \n• stereotyping; and \n• different value systems. \nOvercoming barriers to cross-cultural Communication \nCommon misconceptions of various cultures can create barriers to cross-cultural communication. \nIt is important to identify incorrect perceptions and assumptions about other cultures in order to \novercome them.
