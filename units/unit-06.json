          "content": "Chapter 1 - Reference materials\n\nOverview\nA gas technician/fitter installs, services, and maintains gas equipment and piping systems on a daily basis, and the systems and types of equipment they work on are constantly changing. Therefore, it is important to have access to current reference materials. Moreover, gas-fired equipment must be installed and serviced according to codes, regulations, and manufacturer specifications.\n\nTerminology\n- Manufacturer service bulletins: Instructions from a manufacturer with guidelines for servicing and maintaining appliances or equipment, or updates on equipment problems and provisions for solutions\n- Manufacturer specifications: Specifications and certified installation instructions from a manufacturer for its appliances and equipment\n\nTypes of reference materials\nA gas technician/fitter needs to reference code books, installation manuals, government acts, regulations, bulletins, and directives, as well as manufacturer manuals, specifications, and service bulletins.\n\nCode books and manuals\n\nCSA B149.1, Natural gas and propane installation code\nCSA B149.1 has ten main clauses, as identified in the table of contents. You can find a topic either by searching the table of contents by clause title, or by using the key word index at the back of the Code. Searching the index is the preferred method as it shows cross references on the topic in various clauses of the Code.\n\nCSA B149.2, Propane storage and handling code\nCSA B149.2 has nine main clauses, as identified in table of contents. Similarly, you can search either the table of contents or the index.\n\nCSA B149.3, Code for the field approval of fuel-burning appliances and equipment\nCSA B149.3 contains requirements for the field approval and assembly of non-certified or upgraded gas appliances, equipment, fuel-related components, and accessories located downstream of an appliance's manual shut-off valve.\n\nThis Code consists of 20 clauses and Annexes A to K (all informative), which are listed in the table of contents. Annex B contains symbols and diagrams.\n\nActs, regulations, and directives\n\nProvincial acts\nAn act is a piece of government legislation that defines or assigns responsibilities and enables the writing of regulations. A gas technician/fitter should be familiar with the sections of the applicable act(s) pertaining to their responsibilities.\n\nImportant: The title of the act(s) that deal with the installation of gas equipment, the certification of gas technicians/fitters, or both, varies from province to province.\n\nProvincial regulations\nA regulation is a piece of government legislation made under the authority of an act. A regulation is more specific than an act. For example, there are usually separate regulations for certification or apprenticeship, gas installations, and propane storage.\n\nSafety directives/bulletins\nThe provincial authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) may periodically issue directives and bulletins pertaining to product approval or installation practices. The AHJ is responsible for the adoption of national installation codes, often with changes.\n\nManufacturer specifications\nManufacturers publish specifications and certified installation instructions for their appliances and equipment. It is crucial to read manufacturer publications before installing an appliance and ensure that the specifications and instructions pertain to the appliance being installed.\n\nCompliance with the manufacturer's certified instructions is a legal requirement. CSA B149.1 states that \"[a]n appliance, accessory, component, equipment, or any other item shall be installed in accordance with the manufacturer's certified instructions and this Code\".\n\nTypically, the following information is in gas appliance manufacturer publications:\n• Size of area needed for installation and service\n• Physical dimensions of the equipment\n• Model and part numbers\n• Gas input rate and pressure requirements, and combustion parameters\n• Venting material and configuration requirements\n• Air supply requirements\n• Electrical diagrams and rating\n• Operating sequence\n• Maintenance requirements\n• Troubleshooting tips\n\nManufacturer service bulletins\nManufacturer service bulletins give the service technician guidelines for servicing and maintaining an appliance or equipment. Manufacturers also publish updates on equipment problems and provisions for solutions when necessary.\n\nThe internet is a powerful tool for staying up-to-date on the latest information available concerning a specific appliance or component. A gas technician/fitter should regularly check the manufacturer website for any new information or service bulletins regarding the appliance or component being installed or serviced.\n\nImportant: Carefully read all materials available from the manufacturer.",

Understanding how to read these is essential for gas technicians/fitters.\n\nTypes of technical drawings\n\nOrthographic projections\nOrthographic projections provide separate two-dimensional views of an object. The three most commonly projected views are: top, front, and left side (or right side).\n\nSchematic diagrams\nSchematics show only the connections, functions, and flow within a system, not the actual size, shape, or location of components.\n\nWiring diagrams\nWiring diagrams show how and where wires are connected, and how they run between devices. They are extremely useful for initial wiring and troubleshooting. Solid lines represent factory wiring; broken/dotted lines represent field wiring.\n\nLines and symbols\nDifferent lines convey different meanings on technical drawings:\n\nObject line: Thick lines tracing the visible outline of an object\n\nHidden line: Thin, equally spaced, broken lines showing surfaces and features that are hidden\n\nCentreline: Thin, broken lines with long and short lines spaced alternately, indicating exact centre of object\n\nExtension line: Thin lines extending object lines out to convenient space for dimensioning\n\nDimension line: Thin lines terminating with arrowheads, giving measured dimensions\n\nSection lines: Hatch marks identifying a sectional view\n\nBreak lines: Help shorten the view of long uniform sections\n\nPiping symbols and lines\nSymbols are shorthand signs used on drawings. Common fitting symbols include: elbows, reducing couplings, plugs, caps, crosses, wyes, tees.\n\nPiping line symbols distinguish various types of pipes: cold water, hot water, hot water return, acid waste, compressed air, fire line, gas line, vacuum.\n\nSupplements to mechanical drawings\n\nSpecifications\nA specifications book (written description of work to be performed) supplements the set of technical drawings. The specification is an integral part of a contract document and is generally considered the most important document after the written agreement.\n\nWhen there is disagreement between a specification and a drawing, the specification is considered correct.\n\nScale\nScale allows description of large or small machines on standard size paper. First number refers to dimensions used to draw the object; second number refers to object's actual size.\n\nScale types:\n- Actual scale (1:1): Drawing shows actual size\n- Reduced scale (1:10): One unit on print represents ten units of actual object\n- Enlarged scale (10:1): Ten units on print represents one unit of actual object\n\nRevision block\nLocated in lower left-hand or upper right-hand corner. Lists all revisions made to the drawing after initial drafting.\n\nMaterials block (bill of materials)\nUsually located just above title block. Lists all parts with part/stock numbers, quantities, sizes, and materials.",

Bars may be vertical or horizontal, begin at a baseline, and show the relationship between two or more related variables.\n\nParticularly suitable for:\n• Presenting information to non-technical audience\n• Representing small numbers of plotted values\n• Making simple comparison of two values along two axes\n• Representing data for a total period\n\nUnsuitable for:\n• Comparing several series of data\n• Plotting large numbers of values\n\nPie chart\nPie charts show individual parts as sectors in a circular area, communicating the relationship of these sectors to the total.\n\nCommonly used to:\n• Display data as percentages\n• Present general overall view of information\n• Show relationship between small number of values\n• Emphasize amount of data rather than trend\n\nX-Y graph\nX-Y graphs show values of two related variables plotted as points on a coordinate grid. Points are successively connected to form continuous line or curve.\n\nUsed to:\n• Compare large numbers of values in compact space\n• Compare trends of several curves on one graph\n• Calculate values that fall between plotted points\n\nReading X-Y graphs:\nValues of two variables are plotted with reference to two axes perpendicular to one another, meeting at common origin or zero point.\n\nUnsuitable for:\n• Representing small numbers of plotted values\n• Showing changes in absolute amounts\n• Showing extreme or irregular data movements\n\nFlow chart\nFlow chart is schematic representation of a process, showing information in:\n• Pictorial form\n• Schematic symbols\n• Labelled blocks\n• Combination of all three\n\nLocating data on graphs\nTo determine values from graphs:\n1) Determine value on x-axis\n2) Locate point on line coinciding with x-axis value (trace vertically)\n3) Trace horizontal line to y-axis\n4) Read corresponding value on y-axis",
