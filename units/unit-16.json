          "content": "Chapter 1 covers the components, safety considerations, and types of domestic gas-fired refrigerators.\n\nTHERMOSTAT BULB OR SENSOR:\n\nBulb of thermostatic valve is in shape of wound capillary tube and is positioned at specific point on evaporator (usually the fins) of refrigerator box. Modern bulbs are designed so that last 4 in (10 cm) of capillary act as sensing element.\n\nIn refrigerators with electronic controls, sensors are used to determine temperature and transmit necessary information to manage all system functions. Refer to specific manufacturer's information for each model of fridge.\n\nCARBON MONOXIDE SENSOR:\n\nSome refrigeration units include carbon monoxide (CO) sensor integrated into millivolt (thermocouple-driven) safety valve, to alert user if CO levels exceed allowable 50 ppm (parts per million), and shut down burner entirely if there are dangerous levels of CO.\n\nThese refrigeration units are battery-operated, and their testing procedures include both battery check and CO sensor check. Check manufacturer instructions on how to test this sensor. Newer models feature disconnect that allows separation of CO sensor unit from appliance if there is need to service unit.\n\nIMPORTANT: Propane refrigerators installed in dwellings prior to adoption of 2010 CSA B149.1 Code, which required they be of direct-vented type, must have CO safety shut-off system.\n\nMANUAL GAS VALVE:\n\nManual gas valve consists of main housing and manually activated on/off valve. Manual gas valve is main connection between gas supply and refrigerator.\n\nTYPES OF SYSTEMS AND SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS:\n\nGas technician/fitter may be required to service system that provides heat to absorption refrigerators, with gas burner and its heat exchanger falling within expertise of gas technician/fitter.\n\nIMPORTANT: Gas technician/fitter is not refrigeration technician, so refrigeration components should be left to person qualified in that trade.\n\nLITHIUM-BROMIDE SYSTEMS:\n\nWater-lithium-bromide system is similar to ammonia-water system. However, instead of cooling fins on condenser and absorber, circulation water tubes carry away heat.\n\nAlso, water-lithium-bromide system does not use hydrogen at high pressure to carry refrigerant vapour. Instead, it operates at very low pressures to enable temperature in evaporator and refrigerator cabinet to fall to required level of coldness.\n\nLarger applications primarily use these systems, and these are covered in unit \"Gas-fired air conditioning\".\n\nSAFETY:\n\nBefore working with these systems (and chemicals), refer to company policy and your supervisor.\n\nLITHIUM-BROMIDE SOLUTION IS:\n- Non-toxic\n- Non-flammable\n- Non-explosive\n- Chemically stable\n\nHowever, solution becomes corrosive when exposed to air and may irritate skin, eyes, and mucous membranes.\n\nEMERGENCY FIRST AID (lithium-bromide):\nIf you come in contact with lithium-bromide solution:\n- Flush contacted area with lukewarm water for at least 15 min\n- Remove contaminated clothing (while taking care not to spread chemical)\n- If contamination is extensive, remove clothing under running water\n- Seek medical attention if irritation persists\n\nAMMONIA ABSORPTION:\n\nAmmonia absorption cooling unit is sealed unit not meant to be tampered with in any way. Cooling unit contains ammonia, sodium chromate, and hydrogen at pressure of 300 to 350 psi (2068 to 2413 kPa).\n\nSAFETY WARNING:\nDo not drill, weld, or cut cooling unit. Any rupture of cooling unit will immediately engulf area in ammonia and hydrogen (displacing air).\n\nHydrogen is flammable, and ammonia is intensely irritating gas that can render person unconscious.\n\nEMERGENCY FIRST AID (ammonia):\nKeywords for first aid involving ammonia are, simply, air and water.\n\nIf you inhale ammonia or come in contact with liquid ammonia, immediately:\n- Get fresh air; and\n- Flush any affected area of your body or clothing with plenty of water\n\nSODIUM CHROMATE:\nSodium chromate is carcinogen.\n\nIf you get sodium chromate on you:\n- Wash thoroughly with soap and water; and\n- If you experience lingering effects or have concerns about exposure to cooling unit materials, seek medical attention\n\nWhen working on or changing cooling unit, never allow yourself to be cornered in small area; always have means of exit. Although cooling units are very sturdy, all it takes is one weak point (deteriorated pipe, for example) to create problem.\n\nCAUTION: If cooling unit ruptures, stay away from area and wait for ammonia to dissipate. Call for assistance.\n\nTHREE-WAY REFRIGERATORS:\n\nThree-way refrigerators are combination gas-electrical absorption refrigerators that operate on following basis:\n\nHEAT SOURCE OPTIONS:\n- 120-V HEATER: Current from 120 V AC power supply\n- 12-V HEATER: Current from battery\n- GAS BURNER: Propane from tank or natural gas from supply line\n\nUse of AES system means circuit board in refrigerator selects most appropriate (available) heat source.\n\nAES SELECTION LOGIC:\n- IF 120V is available: Refrigerator will select it\n- IF 120V is unavailable: Next power source in order is 12V\n  (Refrigerator can only utilize 12V under certain conditions, namely, if vehicle is running and batteries are being charged)\n- IF 120V is unavailable AND conditions for 12-V operation are not being met: Refrigerator will operate on propane\n\nSAFETY:\nFor three-way refrigerators, adhere to all safety requirements for electricity and gas. When working with electricity, wear protective equipment required for specific application.\n\nWIRING AND SCHEMATIC DIAGRAMS:\n\nManufacturer's literature for three-way refrigerators often includes wiring diagrams and schematics that you can use for installation and troubleshooting purposes.\n\nELECTRONIC THREE-WAY REFRIGERATORS:\n\nElectronic control of three-way refrigerator serves as gateway for voltage distribution to various components of refrigerator managing inputs, outputs, monitoring, and diagnostic functions. Meanwhile, power board oversees and controls all operations.\n\nInputs, outputs, monitoring information, and diagnostic functions are communicated through optical control assembly. Wire harness interfacing power board with optical control assembly is \"foamed\" into cabinet.\n\nGAS ABSORPTION HEAT PUMPS (GAHP):\n\nGas absorption heat pump (GAHP) operates on same principle as ammonia-water refrigerators, but has added capability of being reversible and serving as heat source.\n\nHEATING MODE (winter):\nWhen operating in heating mode, appliance uses absorption cooling cycle to recover heat from outside environment, which, added to heat produced by combustion of natural/liquefied petroleum gas, is transferred into exchanger and then into environment to be heated. Heat output is used to supply low-temperature hot water for space heating, similar to traditional boiler.\n\nCOOLING MODE:\nSame unit is suitable for cooling by reversing absorption cycle using outside air for heat rejection in cooling mode.\n\nOPERATING EFFICIENCY:\nAlthough GAHPs tend to have lower operating efficiencies compared to electric heat pumps, they can achieve lower operating costs depending on relative costs of energy sources. In general terms, absorption heat pumps are hydronic systems (similar to outside boiler) as they heat or cool (or both) water as it is required.\n\nSUMMER OPERATION:\n- Air cooling water down to 37.4°F\n- Cooling with ambient air up to 37.4°F\n- Gas input\n\nWINTER OPERATION:\n- High efficiency heating water up to 140°F\n- Heat recovery from ambient air down to -20°F\n- Gas input\n\nTYPICAL COMPACT ROOFTOP UNIT:\n- Gas input: 95,000 Btu/h\n- Heating capacity: around 120,000 Btu/h\n- Cooling capacity: nearly 60,000 Btu/h\n\nFor more information on larger commercial systems, refer to unit \"Gas-fired air conditioning\".",

          "content": "Chapter 2 covers installation requirements and procedures for domestic gas-fired refrigerators.\n\nROOF VENT:\n\nRoof vent, which completes venting system, also ensures good air flow. Roof vent is centered over cooling unit and is at least as long as cooling unit is wide.\n\nDIRECT-VENTED MODELS:\n\nDirect-vent (DV) appliance is also known as \"sealed-combustion\" appliance. In these appliances, venting system draws in combustion air and vents all flue gas directly to outdoors. These units have clearance requirements for air flow and heat removal, and plastic venting system must be of ULC S636-approved material installed as per vent manufacturer's instructions.\n\nDV refrigerator must be installed in accordance with manufacturer instructions. Following information identifies some of common concerns.\n\nNEVER VENT TO SIDE OF APPLIANCE:\nVents must terminate directly from back of appliance and out through exterior wall.\n\nHIGH-WIND TERMINATION:\nIdeally, terminate hood vents in sheltered location not affected by high winds. If this is not possible, use manufacturer's high-wind termination hood.\n\nSEALED COMBUSTION VENT IN RVs:\n\nSealed combustion vent design, commonly used in RVs, consists of two parts:\n\nUPPER AND LOWER VENTS:\nThese vents, as in other designs, use internal air from vehicle to exhaust heat away from condenser. If either of these two vents is obstructed or interior of vehicle is extremely hot, cooling unit does not perform efficiently because condenser is unable to cool sufficiently.\n\nSEALED COMBUSTION SECTION:\nSealed combustion section consists of two flex tubes, which link burner assembly to outside vent housing:\n- LARGER FLEX TUBE: Fresh-air intake, which feeds outside air directly to burner\n- SMALLER FLEX TUBE: Exhaust tube, which is used to dissipate products of combustion from boiler tube\n\nIt is important to note contour of two tubes as well as outside vent housing.\n\nIMPORTANT INSTALLATION POINTS:\n- If tubes are not installed correctly, it is very difficult to keep burner lit\n- Without trap in tubes, there will be backdraft into burner box, causing flame to extinguish\n- In case of exhaust tube, there could be buildup of condensation within tube and, if it is not properly bent, condensation will drain backward, drip onto burner, and extinguish flame\n\nVENT HOUSING:\nVent housing for sealed combustion vent must not follow contour of vehicle and must be less than 90° to ground to allow condensation to flow out of housing.\n\nSome manufacturers design vent housings to include separator plate to prevent exhaust air from being channelled back into fresh-air intake.\n\nINSTALLING THE REFRIGERATOR:\n\nRefrigerator installed in mobile home or RV must comply with CSA Z240.4.1 or CSA Z240.4.2 and be installed in accordance with manufacturer instructions.\n\nFor installations in other types of dwellings, refrigerator must be installed according to:\n- CSA B149.1\n- CSA B149.2\n- Manufacturer's certified installation instructions\n\nIN ALL CASES, REFRIGERATOR MUST BE INSTALLED:\n- On flat and level floor\n- Away from direct sunlight\n- Away from any object that may radiate heat\n\nIN ALL CASES:\n- Refrigerator should be located in well-ventilated but not drafty place\n- It is extremely important that refrigerator be installed level (because this type of refrigerator is non-mechanical and operates on basis of gravity)\n- If unit is to be built-in, refer to manufacturer specifications for clearances\n- Keep refrigerator free from combustible materials, gasoline, and other flammable vapours and liquids\n\nGAS CONNECTIONS:\n\nPropane-fired refrigerators are usually made to be connected with 3/8 in (10 mm) copper tube (free from sharp corners and curves) that is mounted on conical coupling connected to manual shut-off valve. Copper tube (feed pipe) must be placed in way that will avoid damage if refrigerator is removed from its compartment.\n\nIn addition, keep following in mind:\n- When connecting refrigerator to its gas supply, check required pressure (as marked on appliance rating plate)\n- Never connect propane gas cylinder directly to refrigerator (i.e., without regulator)\n\nIMPORTANT: Check sealing of all joints using approved leak-detection solution.\n\nFLUE AND VENTILATION SYSTEM:\n\nFlue directs hot gases around and away from generating unit. Occasionally, these flues may be restricted due to:\n- Placing refrigerator too close to wall\n- Placing objects over opening\n- Having obstruction fall into it\n\nKeep flue clean to ensure proper functioning of refrigerator. For information on procedure for cleaning flue, see Chapter 3.\n\nCONTROLS:\n\nMost refrigerators have controls located on console at base of refrigerator and connected to control devices in rear of unit.\n\nMicroprocessor-based systems have digital display for control console that is located at top front or bottom of refrigerator, depending on size and style.\n\nCO SENSOR WITH SAFETY SHUT-OFF:\n\nSome models of gas refrigerators are equipped with CO sensor and/or safety shut-off device. These components must be installed in accordance with manufacturer instructions. Alarm system is designed to emit loud, irritating noise. If very high CO level is detected, CO alarm will activate within few minutes.\n\nAfter positioning and mounting detector, ensure it is connected to appliance. For some models, there is matching plug at lower back of fridge. Other models may require thermocouple interrupter body and adapter.\n\nINSTALLATION PROCEDURE:\n\nFollowing procedure is one example of manufacturer's installation instructions:\n\n1. DETERMINE APPROPRIATE LOCATION AND INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS:\n   a) Read installation and operating instructions\n   b) Prepare gas supply and electrical connections in accordance with code requirements and authority having jurisdiction\n\n2. MOVE APPLIANCE TO AREA WHERE IT WILL BE INSTALLED:\n   a) Ensure that there is adequate ventilation for condenser cooling\n   b) Ensure that venting is secured and tight\n\n3. POSITION REFRIGERATOR IN SELECTED POSITION:\n   a) Rotate levelling bolts under unit until refrigerator is level\n   b) Remove it from its location\n\n4. Use certified flexible-type metal connector of sufficient length (see Clause 6.21.3 of CSA B149.1) to connect gas supply to manual shut-off valve\n\n5. Connect pressure gauge at pressure tap of thermostatic valve; ensure that pressure is correct for appliance\n\n6. Perform leak test for all connections, as required by applicable code\n\nTO CHECK OPERATION:\n\n1. Operate refrigerator according to instructions; allow it to operate for at least 30 min\n\n2. During this 30-min period, use liquid solution or leak-detection device:\n   a) To check connections for leaks; and\n   b) To check from gas inlet to orifice spud\n\n3. Check reading on pressure gauge (refer to manufacturer instructions):\n   - IF appliance is only one operating on line: Operating pressure should not be higher than 11 in w.c. (2.75 kPa)\n   - IF other appliances are on same line: Pressure should not fall below 10 in w.c. (2.5 kPa)\n\n4. Test liquefied petroleum gas safety shut-off system in accordance with manufacturer instructions\n\n5. Turn gas off at control; leave manual shut-off valve open\n\n6. Replace plug on thermostatic valve\n\n7. Replace burner box\n\n8. You can now install refrigerator in selected location; while doing so, make sure no kinks form in flexible connector\n\n9. Set refrigerator to normal operation\n\nINSTRUCTIONS TO CUSTOMER:\n\nAfter installation, cover following points with customer to ensure they understand operation and will be able to pinpoint potential problems. Also encourage customer to read owner's manual in its entirety.\n\n- Inform customer that absorption refrigerator operates noiselessly, which means they will not be able to tell simply by listening whether or not it is working\n- Explain CO sensor test procedures to customer (if their unit came with CO sensor and safety shut-off)\n- Inform customer about cleaning procedures and unit's warranty\n- Advise customer to keep owner's manual close by for handy reference\n- Instruct customer about defrosting refrigerator and freezer compartments\n- Inform customer that efficiency of unit will be reduced if refrigerator is overfilled\n- Explain to customer that unit should be left empty to operate for about 6 to 8 h after light-up to enable temperature to decrease\n\nDEFROSTING:\n\nAfter some time, ice will begin to collect on fins of evaporator to point where it will reduce efficiency of refrigerator. At this point, defrosting is needed.\n\nTake note of following:\n- Defrosting should be done when 50% of space between fins is taken up by ice\n- Interval between instances of defrosting can vary considerably (depending on climate and extent of use)\n\nMost new refrigerator designs incorporate automatic defrost, during which refrigerator periodically runs through defrost cycle, as it is required by control system.\n\nMANUAL DEFROSTING PROCEDURE (typical):\n\n1. Remove food from main compartment or freezer\n2. Set thermostat knob to defrost position\n3. Leave unit for approximately 2 h\n4. During this process, refrigerator will continue to work on low flame providing refrigeration capacity for freezer\n5. Ice on fins will melt, flow down drain to rear of refrigerator, and drain into number of small containers, where it will evaporate\n6. Check fins to make sure they are free of ice\n7. Readjust thermostat to its usual setting\n\nFREEZER DEFROSTING:\nFreezer will need defrosting less frequently (e.g., every two months or so). However, when there is large buildup of ice in freezer compartment:\n\n1. Turn off gas at selector and remove all food\n2. Remove all loose components from refrigerator (e.g., racks, drawers, batteries for lights)\n3. Turn drip pan around so that drain hole is towards front of refrigerator then place suitable container under it to catch runoff from melting ice\n4. Use plastic scraper to remove ice as it melts\n5. Leave doors open until all of ice has melted then remove container\n6. Return drip tray to its normal position",

          "content": "Chapter 3 covers maintenance, servicing, and troubleshooting procedures for domestic gas-fired refrigerators.\n\nMAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS:\n\nTo ensure that domestic gas-fired refrigerator operates properly, it must:\n- Be level\n- Have correct input\n- Have proper air circulation to dissipate heat generated\n\nIf these three conditions are successfully met, refrigerator should operate successfully.\n\nCLEANING AND SERVICING:\n\nTo maintain their safe and efficient operation, gas-fired absorption refrigerator should be serviced and maintained twice year — preferably before season of continued use and especially if refrigerator has not been in use for some time.\n\nWhen servicing gas-fired absorption refrigerator, ensure that its gas supply pressure is correct.\n\nCONDENSER FINS AND ABSORBER:\n\nPeriodically cleaning fins on condenser is essential to ensure good heat removal from these surfaces.\n\nTo check and clean condenser fins and absorber:\n\n1. Move refrigerator away from its permanent location; make sure that flexible connector does not kink\n2. Clean any dust buildup on absorber and condenser (which can lessen heat transfer and impair performance):\n   a) Remove dust from refrigerator and enclosure\n   b) Use clean paintbrush to clean condenser\n\nFLUE SYSTEM:\n\nAfter period in operation, flue may require cleaning. Dirty flue causes reduction in rapid heat transfer from gas flame to generator body.\n\nPeriodic cleaning of flue is needed to:\n- Ensure proper refrigeration\n- Reduce gas consumption\n- Prevent incomplete combustion and production of CO\n\nFollowing procedure for cleaning flue is typical. In all cases, place paper or cloth under refrigerator to collect dirt or debris.\n\n1. Cover burner with cloth\n2. Loosen and remove flue extension\n3. Remove baffle assembly. Clean and inspect assembly. Baffle may contain burnt dust and light surface corrosion, but tip must be intact and not corroded. Soot must not be present (if it is, it indicates incomplete combustion). If you find soot, contact dealer or manufacturer.\n4. Run brush through flame tube. Soot must be absent.\n5. Reassemble baffle, checking its extension if necessary\n6. Assemble flue extension, making sure that wire of baffle fits into slot of baffle\n7. Remove cloth from burner\n8. Reinstall burner box\n9. Check operation of refrigerator\n\nSERVICING BASICS:\n\nWhen servicing absorption refrigerator, it is crucial to maintain balance of these three factors:\n- Heat input\n- Air circulation\n- Levelling\n\nPROPER HEAT INPUT:\n\nManufacturer designs refrigerator so that:\n- Maximum input setting is high enough for unit to respond quickly to added loads, but not so high that generator gets scorched or blistered\n- Minimum input setting is low enough to prevent overcooling but not so low as to allow flame to be blown out by drafts\n\nTo ensure proper heat input:\n\n1. Check gas pressure using manometer at pressure tap (on thermostatic valve); correct it (if necessary) by adjusting regulator at cylinder\n2. If orifice is partially blocked, clean or replace it\n3. Clean or replace filter on gas control inlet side\n4. If flame is impinging on surface or is burning yellow, you will need to clean generator and flue passages to remove soot and ensure rapid heat transfer. Be careful not to damage surfaces of generator.\n\nPROPER AIR CIRCULATION:\n\nFor proper air circulation, air flow to and from unit must be unrestricted.\n\nTo achieve this:\n- Ensure that back of refrigerator is required distance from wall; and\n- Check that foreign objects have not fallen into space behind refrigerator\n\nCooling fins of both condenser and absorber must be free of dirt and lint (as this would hamper flow of air and release of heat to atmosphere).\n\nPROPER LEVELLING:\n\nKeep system level during installation and maintenance (this enables liquids to flow in their proper direction so that heat is absorbed and released according to design of system).\n\nIt is important that evaporator is level to ensure that liquid ammonia spreads out over large area (this allows heat to be drawn efficiently from refrigerator cabinet).\n\nIf unit has been unused for some time, it may fail to start cooling on first try due to empty traps and ammonia vapour blocking tubes in places that affect system's operation. To overcome this, some manufacturers recommend:\n\n1. Shut unit off for several hours to allow all of ammonia vapour to condense, flow back to generator, and fill liquid traps\n2. After about 10 min of operation, tilt unit to left for 30 sec, then to right for 30 sec\n3. Repeat previous step three or four times, then put refrigerator in upright, level position. Unless unit is defective, it should begin freezing at this point.\n\nMAXIMUM OFF-LEVEL OPERATION LIMITS:\nRefrigerant circulates through cooling unit by gravity flow, so refrigerator must be operated in level position. Its operation off level will affect flow of refrigerant through cooling system.\n\nMaximum off-level operation limits are:\n- 3° side-to-side; and\n- 6° front-to-back\n\nExceeding maximum off-level limits can permanently damage cooling unit.\n\nNOTE: In mobile gas-fired refrigerators, cooling unit and its performance are not affected when vehicle is in motion.\n\nTESTING COMPONENTS:\n\nFollowing information on testing components is intended to provide broad understanding of basic process. Manufacturer instructions on component testing will be provided in service manual that comes with unit.\n\nCO SENSOR WITH SAFETY SHUT-OFF:\n\nFor units supplied with CO sensor, manufacturers recommend testing operation of alarm at least once per week during use and/or if appliance has been turned off for some time.\n\nFollowing is typical procedure on how to test CO sensor:\n\n1. Push and hold test button until you hear \"beep\" then release button\n2. Unit will test measurement circuit for correct operation\n3. At end of test, unit will beep for three seconds to confirm test and then resume normal operation\n\nThis test will shut off gas supply to appliance, so it will need to be relit before resuming operation.\n\nFLAME-FAILURE DEVICE:\n\nCheck operation of flame-failure device as follows:\n\n1. With refrigerator running, set thermostat to its coldest setting\n2. Close and then immediately open selector valve. (Flame will go out, but gas supply will continue to flow.)\n3. Listen carefully. In about 30 to 40 sec, you will hear slight but distinct \"click\" signifying that valve has closed.\n\nREPLACING COMPONENTS:\n\nORIFICE HOUSING:\n\nUsing two open-ended spanners to disassemble nipple holder can help to remove orifice. When replacing orifice housing:\n\n1. Remove injector piece and check for obstructions\n2. Clean piece with alcohol and compressed air\n3. Before reassembling, gently tap on gas tube leading to burner few times to loosen any lint collected in tube\n4. Reassemble and carefully tighten\n\nBURNER:\n\nDepending on type of refrigerator, burner assembly can be either gas-only or combination gas-electric unit.\n\nTo replace gas-only burner:\n1. Remove cover by unscrewing screws\n2. Unscrew burner jet\n3. Remove burner by unscrewing mounting screw\n4. Insert replacement burner (of same make and model)\n5. Reassemble mounting screw and cover\n\nTo replace gas-electric burner:\n1. Remove covers by unscrewing screws\n2. Disconnect heater cords at terminal blocks (note their locations for reassembly)\n3. Carefully remove capillary tube from evaporator to avoid damage\n4. Remove screws\n5. Release burner housing from flue by turning lever outward and to right\n6. Pull equipment out of cabinet\n7. Replace burner (with one of same make and model)\n\nADDITIONAL COMPONENTS:\n\nFollowing components also affect overall performance of refrigerator and should be tested and serviced during call. Refer to manufacturer's service manual for cleaning, testing, and servicing instructions:\n\n- Cabinet and absorber fan motors\n- Door switches\n- Cabinet lights\n- Heaters\n- Defrost switch\n- Door seal\n- Refrigeration unit\n- Defrost heater and safety switch\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING PROCEDURES:\n\nProcedure for troubleshooting gas-fired absorption refrigerator is similar to procedure for other gas-fired appliances.\n\nWhen responding to customer trouble call:\n\n1. Clarify customer's complaint by asking questions and getting as much information as possible\n2. Interpret customer's complaint using manufacturer's service manuals\n3. Identify potential faults that could be causing problem and test components that may be at fault\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING TIPS:\n\nFollowing tips are specific to gas-fired refrigerators:\n\nCHECK FOR SODIUM CHROMATE:\nThis can be identified by its bright yellow colour. Some other points about this substance:\n- Sodium chromate solidifies when exposed to air\n- If sodium chromate is visible on outside tubes, it indicates that there is refrigerant leak\n\nCHECK TEMPERATURE OF UNIT:\n\n- IF cooling unit is functioning properly: There will be even heat on both boiler section and middle of absorber coils\n- IF boiler section is hot, and absorber section is warm: Evaporator unit is blocked\n- IF boiler section is warm, and absorber is hot: Hydrogen circuit has lost its charge of hydrogen and boiled ammonia is circulating through cooling unit (as there is no hydrogen to cause it to evaporate)\n- IF inside of fridge is warm, but there is frost on condenser fins: There is internal leak in evaporator\n\nGRADUAL DECREASE IN COOLING EFFICIENCY:\n\nGradual decrease in cooling efficiency is not clear indication of cooling system failure.\n\nOther factors that affect cooling efficiency include:\n- Ventilation\n- Heat input\n- Not-level operation\n- Lack of appropriate service and maintenance\n- Inadequate repairs\n- Unauthorized field modifications\n\nIf any of these exist and are not corrected, replacement cooling unit will also perform inefficiently or fail.\n\nBest approach when dealing with gradual decrease in cooling is step-by-step troubleshooting. It is important to appreciate that cooling unit is working, it is just not working efficiently.\n\nTroubleshooting should always begin by checking ventilation, followed by thorough check of cooling unit and heat sources. In majority of reported cases, problem is related to installation of unit, which has since hindered cooling unit ventilation. Ambient air temperature can also play significant role if unit was not installed correctly.\n\nIncorrect installation leads to poor ventilation, resulting in suboptimal cooling performance. When diagnosing cooling unit with poor cooling performance, consider unit's service and maintenance history. History and scope of previous service work can often point directly to cause (and solution) of cooling issue.\n\nBefore troubleshooting can begin, cooling unit must reach its normal operating temperature, process that typically takes about four hours, though exact time will depend on ambient air temperature.\n\nFor more detailed information on common issues and their causes, refer to troubleshooting chart.",

These unique refrigeration systems use a \nsealed pressure system where refrigerant travels through the system, \nabsorbing and releasing heat at key areas to cool the refrigerator and \nfreezer compartments.\nMK by Mike Kapin\nCreated\nCopywrite 2025\nBasic Components of Absorption Refrigerators\nGenerator (Boiler)\nThe heat energy source \nthat begins and maintains \nthe operating cycle. The \ngenerator heats the \nrefrigerant, turning it into a \nvapor so it separates from \nthe water solution and \ntravels to the condenser.\nCondenser\nRemoves heat from the \nvaporized refrigerant, \ncausing it to condense into \na liquid. Condenser fins \ntransfer heat from the \nfridge to the condenser \ncoils.\nEvaporator\nThe liquid refrigerant \nencounters pressurized \nhydrogen and evaporates. \nThis heat transfer makes \nthe tubes cold, cooling the \nrefrigerator.\nAbsorber\nConsists of a coil and tank. \nThe liquid inside attracts \nand absorbs the refrigerant \nfrom the evaporator, \nstoring it until the \ngenerator begins the cycle \nagain.\nLearning Objectives\nDescribe Basic \nOperating Principles\nUnderstand how absorption \nrefrigeration systems \nfunction without moving \nparts\nDescribe Generator \nComponents\nLearn about the key \ncomponents in gas-fired \nrefrigerator generators\nUnderstand System Types and Safety\nIdentify different absorption system types and their safety \nconsiderations\nKey Terminology\nTerm\nAbbreviation\nDefinition\nAutomatic energy selector \nsystem\nAES\nA system that lets the circuit \nboard in the refrigerator select \nthe most appropriate available \nheat source\nCondenser\nRemoves heat from the \nvapourized refrigerant\nCondenser fins\nTransfer heat from the fridge \nto the condenser coils\nCondensing effect\nChanging of gas into a liquid\nOrifice housing\nProvides the correct air-gas \nratio\nThermal mastic\nHeat transfer compound\nThermostatic valve\nSenses the temperature of the \nevaporator and varies the heat \ninput\nBasic Operating Principles\nAn absorption-refrigeration system uses three key elements to create a \ncooling effect:\nRefrigerant\nThe substance that absorbs \nand releases heat during the \nrefrigeration cycle\nAdsorbent\nThe material that absorbs \nthe refrigerant during part \nof the cycle\nHeat\nThe energy source that drives the refrigeration process\nUnlike compression refrigeration systems, the basic absorption cycle \nuses no moving parts. The cycle depends on the action and reaction \nbetween the refrigerant and the adsorbent under various pressure and \ntemperature conditions in a sealed system.\nCooling and Condensing Effects\nCooling Effect\nThe system makes use of the cooling effect that results \nwhen liquids flash to a gaseous state. This is similar to \nblowing on the back of your hand when there is water on it - \nthe blowing causes the water to evaporate and your hand \nfeels slightly cold.\nCondensing Effect\nThe condensing effect occurs when heat is removed from a \ngas, changing it back into a liquid. This process happens in \nthe condenser section of the refrigerator, where heat is \ntransferred away from the refrigerant.\nCutaway View of Propane \nRefrigerator\nThis cutaway view shows the main components of a propane refrigerator. \nAmmonia is liquefied in the finned condenser coil at the top rear of the \nrefrigerator. The liquid ammonia then flows into the evaporator (inside \nthe freezer section) and is exposed to circulating flow of hydrogen gas, \nwhich causes the ammonia to evaporate, creating a cold condition in the \nfreezer.\nRefrigerant Flow Circuits\nSolution Circuit\nContains the ammonia-water solution that circulates \nbetween generator and absorber\nCondensing Circuit\nWhere ammonia vapor is cooled and condensed into liquid\nHydrogen Circuit\nWhere hydrogen gas helps evaporate the ammonia to \ncreate cooling\nFlow of Refrigerant: Step 1\nGenerator (Boiler) Heats Strong \nSolution\nThe perk tube is provided with a strong \nammonia solution (high percentage of \nammonia to water) from the absorber \ntank.\nWhen heated, the ammonia in the strong \nsolution begins to vaporize, creating \nbubbles with a percolating effect.\nThe ammonia vapor pushes the now \nweakened solution up and out of the perk \ntube.\nAmmonia Vapor Travels to \nCondenser\nThe ammonia vapor (gas) leaving the perk \ntube goes upward towards the top of the \ncooling unit.\nLittle of the water vapor travels upwards \nbecause ammonia vaporizes at a lower \ntemperature than water, causing the two \nto separate.\nA rectifier, and sometimes a water \nseparator, catches the little water that \nvaporizes.\nWeak Solution Travels Back to \nAbsorber\nAs rich vaporized ammonia travels to the \ncondenser, the now weakened, still warm \nsolution flows downward to the top of the \nabsorber coils and enters the absorber \ntank at a cooler temperature.\nWhen flowing downward through the coil, \nthe weak solution picks up evaporated \nammonia from the evaporator. This \nabsorption process generates heat that is \ndissipated through the absorber fins.\nFlow of Refrigerant: Step 2\nAmmonia Vapor Cools in \nCondenser\nAmmonia vapor enters the condenser \nwhere it undergoes cooling by air passing \nthrough the condenser metal fins at the rear \nof the refrigerator.\nThe cooling effect of the condenser, \ncoupled with a series of reductions in pipe \nsize, forces the ammonia vapor into a liquid \nstate, where it enters the evaporator \nsection.\nLiquid Ammonia Evaporates When \nIt Contacts Pressurized Hydrogen\nLiquid ammonia coming in contact with \npressurized hydrogen absorbs heat and \nevaporates. This is the principle whereby \nthe heat is absorbed from both the freezer \nand refrigerator boxes.\nLiquid ammonia enters the low temperature \nevaporator (freezer) and trickles down the \npipe, wetting the walls. Hydrogen passes \nover the wetted walls, causing the liquid \nammonia to evaporate at an initial \ntemperature of around -20°F (-29°C).\nThe Ammonia Vapor and \nHydrogen Drop to the Absorber \nTank\nThe ammonia vapor created through the \nevaporation mixes with the already present \nhydrogen vapor, making it heavier.\nSince the ammonia and hydrogen vapor \nmixture is heavier than the purer hydrogen, \nit drops down through the return tube to the \nabsorber tank.\nFlow of Refrigerant: Final Step\nStrong Solution Absorbs \nAmmonia Vapor\nWhen the ammonia and hydrogen \nvapor mixture enters the absorber \ntank through the return tube, much \nof the ammonia vapor is absorbed \ninto the surface of the strong \nsolution, which occupies the lower \nhalf of the tank.\nHydrogen Returns to the \nEvaporator\nNow lighter, the ammonia and \nhydrogen mixture (now with less \nammonia) begins to rise up the \nabsorber coil. The weak ammonia \nsolution trickling down the absorber \ncoil from the top is \"hungry\" for the \nammonia vapor that is rising up the \nabsorber coil with the hydrogen.\nCycle Continues\nThis weak ammonia solution \neventually absorbs all the ammonia \nfrom the mixture as it rises, allowing \npure hydrogen to rise up the inner \npipe of the evaporator section, \ncompleting the cycle.\nGenerator Components\nAlthough various brands and models use different components, configured in vastly different ways, this drawing represents a \nstandard refrigerator propane generator system. The test port (shown closed) is visible in the diagram.\nModern Generator Assembly\nElectronic Ignition\nModern refrigerators use electronic \nignition systems that are more reliable \nand efficient than older manual \nsystems.\nElectronic Sensing\nTemperature sensors provide \nfeedback to the control system, \nallowing for precise temperature \ncontrol and improved efficiency.\nThermostatic Valve\nThe amount of cooling depends on the amount of heat produced by the flame. The \nhigher the flame, the faster the cooling, and vice versa.\nThe thermostatic valve senses the temperature of the evaporator (through the \nthermostat capillary) and varies the heat input (by modulating the gas pressure delivered \nto the burner) to make the operation automatic.\nThis ensures that the correct temperature is maintained in the refrigerator.\nThermostatic Valve Components\nManual Selector\nFor electrical or gas operation. \nMost absorption refrigerators \ncan operate either on propane \ngas or electricity. Some units \nhave automatic energy selectors \nthat automatically choose the \nmost appropriate source of \npower.\nThermostat Control\nWhen the thermostat calls for \ncooling, the maximum pressure \nof propane is allowed through \nthe orifice of the burner. The \nthermostat control adjusts the \namount of pressure admitted \nand, thus, controls the size of the \nflame and the amount of heat \ngenerated.\nBypass Screw\nWhen the desired temperature is \nreached, the thermostat blocks \nthe \"open\" pathway and routes \nthe propane through the bypass \ncircuit. The bypass section only \nallows a very small amount of gas \nthrough, just enough to keep the \nthermocouple and the \nrefrigeration system heated.\nMore Thermostatic Valve \nComponents\nPressure Tap\nFor most propane-fired refrigerators, the correct gas inlet pressure is 11 \ninches w.c. Referring to the manufacturer's specifications can help \ndetermine the exact pressure. This appliance is probably the most \nsensitive when it comes to gas pressure; there is very little tolerance in the \ngas pressure before problems begin.\nThermostatic Control Mechanism\nOperates in relation to the temperature of the evaporator fins. With the \nsafety device open, the gas flows normally through the main passage up to \nthe thermostat operating mechanism. By increasing the temperature at \nthe evaporator, the gas inside the thermostat capillary increases in \npressure, causing the set and pin to rise.\nOrifice and Orifice Housing\nFunction\nThe orifice controls the amount of gas injected into the \nburner. The main function of the orifice housing is to provide \na correct air-gas ratio. As the diameters of the air and gas \npassages ",

The generator \nis the heat energy source that begins and maintains the operating cycle. The \nenergy source may be steam, gas (natural gas or propane), or hot water. In \ngeneral, gas is used for a system having a small capacity; steam and hot \nwater may be used for systems having large capacities. \nSee Unit 28 Gas-fired air conditioning for more information on large \nsystems. \nThe generator heats the refrigerant, turning it into a vapour so that it will \nseparate from the water solution and travel up to the condenser. \nCondenser \nThe condenser removes heat from the vapourized refrigerant, causing it to \ncondense into a liquid. Condenser fins, located in the refrigeration \ncompartment, serve to transfer the heat from the fridge to the condenser \ncoils. \nEvaporator \nIn the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant encounters a pressurized hydrogen \natmosphere and evaporates. This heat transfer makes the tubes of the \nevaporator cold. This action is similar to blowing on the back of your hand \nwhen there is water on it. The blowing causes the water to evaporate and \nyour hand feels slightly cold. \nThermal mastic is a heat transfer compound applied to the outside of the \nevaporator coils of the cooling unit at points where they make metal-to-metal \ncontact with the freezer plate and fins of the refrigerator. Thermal mastic \ngreatly enhances the cooling ability of the unit and failure to use it will result \nin poor cooling. \nSeptember 2020 \n7\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 16 \nDomestic gas-fired refrigerators \nMain \ncomponent \nAbsorber \nUnion \nDescription \nThe tubing in the evaporator section is specifically sloped to provide a \ncontinuous movement of liquid ammonia, flowing downward by gravity \nthrough this section. If the refrigerator is operated when not level, liquid \nammonia will accumulate in sections of the evaporator tubing. This will slow \nthe circulation of hydrogen and ammonia gas, or in severe cases, \ncompletely block it, resulting in a loss of cooling. \nThe absorber consists of a coil and a tank. The function of the liquid inside \nthe absorber is to attract-and absorb-the refrigerant from the evaporator. \nIt is then stored in its tank until the generator begins the cycle again. \nFigure 1-1 \nCutaway view of propane refrigerator \nManual shut-off \nvalve \nCondenser \nCopper capillary \ntube \nAbsorber \ntank \nBriefly described, ammonia is liquefied in the finned condenser coil at the top rear of the \nrefrigerator. The liquid ammonia then flows into the evaporator (inside the freezer section) and is \nexposed to circulating flow of hydrogen gas, which causes the ammonia to evaporate, creating a \ncold condition in the freezer. The next section will describe the process in greater detail. \n8 \nSeptember 2020\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 16 \nDomestic gas-fired refrigerators \nFlo\"v of refrigerant \nFigure 1-2 shows the basic refrigerant flow through the three main circuits of an ammonia \nabsorption refrigerator: \n• the solution circuit; \n• the condensing circuit; and \n• the hydrogen circuit. \nThe following explanation of the flow describes how refrigeration occurs through the shedding or \nabsorbing of heat as the ammonia solution changes from liquid to vapour and back to liquid \nagain. \nSeptember 2020 \n9\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 16 \nDomestic gas-fired refrigerators \nFigure 1-2 \nBasic operation of an ammonia absorption refrigerator \n10 \nLegend: \ntemperature \nLow{ \nevaporator \nHigh \ntemperature \nevaporator \nFuse \nAbsorber \ncoils \nAbsorber tank ------\n-\nRich ammonia solution \nI .l ~ i Weak ammonia solution \nD \nAmmonia vapour \n-\nLiquid ammonia \nD \nHydrogen \nD \nAmmonia and hydrogen vapour \nLiquid heat exchanger \n-Rectifier \nt \nChimney \nGas heat \nexchanger \n_......,i-----1- Perk \ntube \nBoiler \nBaffle \n-+llli;i;l-f:,,.+--+- Element \nholder \nSeptember 2020\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 16 \nDomestic gas-fired refrigerators \nFlow \nRefrigeration \n1.

The ammonia vapour pushes the now weakened solution \nup and out of the perk tube. \n2. Ammonia vapour travels to . The ammonia vapour (gas) leaving the perk tube goes \ncondenser \nupward towards the top of the cooling unit. \n. Little of the water vapour travels upwards because \nammonia vapourizes at a lower temperature than water, \ncausing the two to separate. A rectifier, and sometimes a \nwater separator, catches the little water that vapourizes. \n. At this point, pure ammonia vapour travels to the \ncondenser. \n3. Weak solution travels back . As rich vapourized ammonia travels to the condenser, the \nto absorber \nnow weakened, still warm solution flows downward to the \ntop of the absorber coils and enters the absorber tank at a \ncooler temperature. \n• When flowing downward through the coil, the weak solution \npicks up evaporated ammonia from the evaporator.

Ammonia vapour enters the condenser where it undergoes \ncondenser \ncooling by air passing through the condenser metal fins at \nthe rear of the refrigerator. \n.

To properly understand the \nventing requirement, it is necessary to understand the three different venting requirements of the \nrefrigerator. These include: \n• ventilation air flow across the fins for the removal of heat; \n• ventilation for the supply of combustion air; and \n• venting of the exhaust gases to outside. \nVentilation ( cooling) air flow \nThe evaporator in an absorption refrigerator needs to dissipate the heat it absorbs from the \nrefrigerant; it is, therefore, essential that proper venting occurs behind the refrigerator. If the heat \nis not dissipated away from the condenser, the ammonia will not be able to liquefy; thus, no \ncooling will take place. The following describes how venting occurs: \n• When the cooling unit gives off heat, it causes air around it to warm. \n• Warm air rises, causing cooling air from the lower vent to enter the area, extract more heat \nfrom the cooling unit and rise. \n• The greater the difference in temperature between the warmer air and the cooler air, the faster \nthe air will rise. \n• \nf\\l,::irrf'\\\\A/inn tho n,::ith r,f tho ,::iir fir,\"' fr,rt\"oc tho f\"f'\\f'\\lor ,::iir thrr,1 ,nh tho f\"f'\\f'\\linn , init f\"f'\\ilc ,::ic:, it ricoc:,\nImportant: Never install any gas appliance in an airtight structure or sleeping area without \nproper venting. \nGas technician/fitter must refer to and install gas-fired refrigerators strictly according to the \nprovincial code requirements and the manufacturer's installation instructions. \nThe following Subsection of CSA B149.1 is a requirement for all new installations in Canada. \n7.34 \nRefrigerators \n7.34.1 \nExcept where permitted by Clause 4.13.2, a refrigerator shall have the following minimum \nclearances from combustible material, disregarding any guard or baffle on the refrigerator: \na) \nabove-12 in (300 mm); and \nb) \nback and sides -\n2 in (50 mm). \n7.34.2 \nA refrigerator installed in a dwelling unit shall be of the direct-vent type. \n7.34.3 \nAn unvented refrigerator shall be installed in an area that is not normally occupied and does not \ndirectly communicate with occupied areas. \nA direct vent propane fridge will need to be located/ installed on an outside wall.\nUnvented models for use in areas such as shops, sheds, screened porches, and other open \nareas will come equipped with a carbon monoxide (CO) alarm with safety shut-off. \nNon-direct ventilation suggestions \nThe list below suggests ways to improve the air flow and gas venting of non-direct vent \nrefrigerators. \nImportant: Always refer to and follow the manufacturer's certified installation instructions as \nwell. \nOptions to improve venting \nMake sure there is the recommended \nclearance on the sides and top of the \nfridge. Refer to Figure 2-2. \nAny more than 1 inch (25 mm) \nclearance means the draft may bypass \nthe condenser fins. \nFigure \nFigure 2-2 \nProper clearances for venting \nRoof vent \n1 inch max. \nclearance\nSometimes circumstances prevent the \nuse of a top-mounted vent, and an \nupper side vent is the only solution. An \nupper side vent will work if installed \nproperly and used only with small \nrefrigerators. If equipped with a side \nVf3nt, the bottom of the upper side vent \nshould be at the same level as the top \nof the refrigerator. \nOn many installations there is not \nenough height to accommodate this \nrequirement. A deflector should then be \nmade from the top of the refrigerator to \nthe top of the upper side vent (see \nFigure 2-4 ). This will help to channel \nthe air to the outside. \nRoof vent \nLower vent \nCourtesy of RV Mobile Inc. \nFigure 2-4 \nLocation of deflector if not enough room for \ninstallation requirements \nSheet metal \nBaffle to within \n0.25 inches \n(6mm) \nLower vent \nThe roof vent, which caps off the venting, also allows for good air flow. \nThe roof vent is centred over the cooling unit (Figures 2-2 and 2-3) and is at least as long as the \ncooling unit is wide. \nDirect vented models \nDirect vent (DV) appliances are often referred to as seal combustion appliances.

This plate serves to \nprevent exhaust air from being channelled back into the fresh-air intake. \nInstalling the refrigerator \nA refriaerator installed in a mobile home or recreational vehicle must comply with CSA Z240.4.1\n• Keep the appliance free from combustible materials, gasoline, and other flammable vapours \nand liquids. \nGas connections \nPropane-fired refrigerators are usually made to be connected with a 3/8 inch (10 mm) copper \ntube that is free from sharp corners and curves. It is to be mounted on the conical coupling \nconnected to the manual shut-off valve. This feed pipe must be placed so as to avoid damage \nwhen the refrigerator is removed from its compartment. Also, keep the following in mind: \n• When connecting the refrigerator to the gas supply, check the required pressure as marked on \nthe appliance rating plate. \n• Never connect a propane gas cylinder directly to the refrigerator without a regulator. \nNote: Check the sealing of all joints using an approved leak detection solution. \nFlue and ventilation system \nThe flue directs hot gases around and away from the generating unit. Occasionally, these flues \nmay be restricted by: \n• placing the refrigerator too close to the wall; \n• placing objects over the opening; or \n• having some obstruction fall into it. \nKeep the flue clean to ensure proper functioning of the refrigerator.

Maintenance and servicing \nOverview \nPurpose \nThe key factors for ensuring that domestic gas-fired refrigerators operate properly are that the \nrefrigerator: \n• is level; \n• has the correct input; and \n• has proper air circulation to dissipate the heat generated. \nIf these three conditions are met, the refrigerator should operate successfully. \nObjectives \nAt the end of this chapter, you will be able to: \n• describe the biannual cleaning and servicing procedures; and \n• describe the troubleshooting procedures. \nTerminology \nTerm \nAbbreviation \nDefinition \n(Symbol) \nCarbon monoxide sensor \nSenses carbon monoxide (co) concentrations in \nthe air. \nCleaning and servicing \nTo maintain a safe and efficient operation, gas-fired absorption refrigerators should be serviced \nand maintained twice a year, preferably before a season of continued use and especially if the \nrefrigerator has been not in use for some time. \nWhen servicing gas-fired absorption refrigerators, ensure that the gas supply pressure is correct. \nCondenser fins and absorber \nPeriodical cleaning of fins on the condenser is a must to ensure good heat removal from these \nsurfaces. \nSeptember 2020 \n41\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 16 \nDomestic gas-fired refrigerators \nTo check and clean the condenser fins and absorber, follow this procedure: \n1) \nMove the refrigerator away from its permanent location, making sure the flexible connector \ndoes not kink. \n2) \nClean dust buildup on the absorber and condenser, which can lessen the heat transfer and \nimpair performance: \na) \nRemove the dust from the refrigerator and the enclosure. \nb) \nClean the condenser using a paintbrush. \nFlue system \nAfter a period of operation, the flue may require cleaning. A dirty flue causes a reduction in rapid \nheat transfer from the gas flame to the generator body. Periodic cleaning of the flue is then \nneeded to: \n• ensure proper refrigeration; \n• reduce gas consumption; and \n• prevent incomplete combustion and the generation of carbon monoxide (CO). \nThe following procedure for cleaning the flue is typical of that given in manufacturer's \ninstructions. In all cases, be sure to place papers or cloth under the refrigerator to collect dirt or \ndebris. \n1) \nCover the burner with a cloth. \n2) \nLoosen and remove the flue extension. \n3) \nRemove the baffle assembly. \n-\nClean and inspect this assembly. The baffle may contain burnt dust and light surface \ncorrosion. The tip, however, must be intact, not corroded. Soot must not be present, as \nthis is a sign of incomplete combustion. Should this soot occur, contact the dealer or \nmanufacturer. \n4) \nRun the brush through the flame tube. Soot must not appear. \n5) \nReassemble the baffle checking its extension, if necessary. \n6) \nAssemble the flue extension, making sure that the wire of the baffle fits into the baffle's slot. \n7) \nRemove the cloth from the burner. \n8) \nReinstall the burner box. \n9) \nCheck the refrigerator operation. \nServicing basics \nIn absorption refrigerator servicing, there are three factors that must be kept in balance: \n• heat input; \n• air circulation; and \n• levelling. \nr \nt \nThe manufacturer designs the refrigerator so that the maximum input setting is high enough for \nthe unit to respond quickly to added loads but not so high that the generator is scorched or \n42 \nSeptember 2020\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 16 \nDomestic gas-fired refrigerators \nblistered . The minimum input setting is low enough to prevent over-cooling but not so low as to \nallow the flame to be blown out by drafts. \nTo ensure proper heat input, conduct the following checks: \n1) \nYou can check the gas pressure using a manometer at the pressure tap (on the thermostatic \nvalve) and correct it by adjusting the regulator at the cylinder. \n2) \nIf the orifice is partially blocked, you can clean or replace the orifice. \n3) \nClean or replace the filter in the gas control inlet side. \n4) \nIf the flame impinges on a surface or is burning yellow, the generator and flue passages will \nbecome coated with soot and needs to be cleaned for rapid heat transfer. Ensure that you do \nnot damage the generator surfaces. \nProper air circulation \nTo ensure proper air circulation, air flow to and from the unit must not be restricted . \nEnsure that: \n• the back of the refrigerator is the correct distance from the wall; and \n• foreign objects have not fallen into the space. \nThe cooling fins of both the condenser and the absorber must be free of dirt and lint, which would \nhamper the flow of air and the release of heat to the atmosphere. \nProper levelling \nKeep the system level during installation and maintenance, allowing liquids to flow in the proper \ndirection so that heat is absorbed and released according to the system's design. \nIt is important that the evaporator is level so that the liquid ammonia is spread out over a large \narea. This allows the heat to be drawn efficiently from the refrigerator cabinet. \nIf a unit is temporarily unused, it may fail to start to cool on the first try. The traps may empty of \nliquid, with the ammonia vapour blocking the tubes in the wrong places. To overcome this \ncondition, some manufacturers recommend one of the following methods: \n1) \nShut the unit off for several hours, allowing all the ammonia vapour to condense and flow \nback to the generator and to fill the liquid traps. \n2) \nAfter about 10 minutes of operation, tilt the unit to the left for 30 seconds, then to the right for \n30 seconds. \n3) \nRepeat above step three or four times, then put the refrigerator in the upright, level position. \nIf the unit is not defective, it should begin freezing. \nThe circulation of the refrigerant through the cooling unit is accomplished by gravity flow; \ntherefore, the refrigerator must be operated in the level position. Off-level operation affects the \nflow of the refrigerant through the cooling system. \nThe maximum off-level operation limits are: \n• 3 degrees from side-to-side; and \n• 6 degrees from front-to-back. \nSeptember 2020 \n43\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 16 \nDomestic gas-fired refrigerators \nExceeding the maximum off-level limits can permanently damage the cooling unit. In mobile gas-\nfired refrigerators, the cooling unit or its performance are not affected when the vehicle is in \nmotion. \nTesting components \nThe following information on testing components is intended to give a broad understanding of the \nbasic process. Specific manufacturer's instructions for component testing will be provided in the \nservice manual. \nC() sensor \\cvith safetv shut-off \n.,; \nFor units supplied with a CO sensor, manufacturers recommend testing the alarm operation at \nleast once per week during use or if the appliance has been turned off for a period of time. \nThe following procedure is typical of a manufacturer's instruction on how to test a carbon \nmonoxide sensor: \n1) \nPush and hold the test button down until a \"beep\" is heard, then release button. \n2) \nUnit will test measurement circuit for correct operation. \n3) \nAt the end of the test, the unit will sound a three-second test confirmation beep and resume \nnormal operation. \nThe test will shut down the gas supply to the appliance so it will need to be re-lit to resume \noperation. \nFlan1e--failurc device \nCheck the operation of the flame-failure device as follows: \n1) \nWith the refrigerator running, set the thermostat to the coldest setting. \n2) \nClose and then immediately open the selector valve. The flame will go out, but the gas \nsupply will continue to flow. \n3) \nListen carefully. In about 30 to 40 seconds, you will hear a slight but very distinct \"click\" to \nsignify that the valve has closed. \nReplacing components \nThe following information on replacing components is intended to give a broad understanding of \nthe basic process. Specific manufacturer's instructions for component replacement will be \nprovided in the service manual. \nOrifice (injector) housing \nDisassembling the nipple holder with two open-end spanners can help take off the orifice \n(injector). Follow this procedure when replacing the orifice housing: \n1) \nTake off the injector piece and check whether it is obstructed. \n2) \nClean with alcohol and compressed air. \n3) \nBefore reassembling, tap gently a few times on the gas tube leading to the burner to loosen \nany lint collected in the tube. \n4) \nReassemble and tighten carefully. \n44 \nSeptember 2020\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 16 \nDomestic gas-fired refrigerators \nBurner \nDepending on the type of refrigerator, the burner assembly can be a gas only or a combination \ngas-electric unit. \nTo replace a gas only burner, do the following: \n1) \nRemove the cover by removing the screws. \n2) \nUnscrew the burner jet. \n3) \nRemove the burner by removing the mounting screw. \n4) \nInsert replacement burner that is the same make and model. \n5) \nReassemble the mounting screw and cover. \nTo replace a gas-electric burner, follow this procedure: \n1) \nRemove the covers by removing the screws. \n2) \nDisconnect the heater cords at the terminal blocks (note the location for later reassembly). \n3) \nTo avoid damaging the capillary tube, remove it carefully from the evaporator. \n4) \nRemove the screws. \n5) \nRelease the burner housing from the flue by turning the lever outwards and to the right. \n6) \nPull the equipment out from the cabinet. \n7) \nReplace the burner with the same make and model. \nAdditional components \nThe following components also affect the overall performance of a refrigerator and should be \ntested and serviced during a call. \nRefer to the manufacturer's service manual for cleaning, testing, and servicing instructions for \nthese components: \n• cabinet and absorber fan motors; \n• door switches; \n• cabinet lights; \n• heaters; \n• defrost switch; \n• door seal; \n• refrigeration unit; and \n• defrost heater and safety switch. \nTroubleshooting procedures \nThe procedure for troubleshooting gas-fired absorption refrigerators is similar to that of other gas-\nfired app",
