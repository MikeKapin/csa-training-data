          "content": "Chapter 1 covers air filtration systems, focusing on electronic air cleaners (EACs) and UV air purifiers. The customer can clean EAC cells independently, but a gas technician/fitter should ensure the customer fully understands the cleaning procedures.\n\nTo clean cells, carefully slide them out of the cabinet (they may have sharp edges). Wash the cells by either soaking them in a utility sink or placing them in an automatic dishwasher. Take precautions to avoid damaging the ionizing wires. Use detergent for cleaning, following manufacturer instructions. After washing, check the cells for dirt or residue and repeat washing if necessary. Before reassembling the EAC, clean the pre-filter by washing with detergent or vacuuming it. Do not wash the pre-filter in the dishwasher. Do not soak the pre-filter at the same time as the cells, as lint from the pre-filter can become caught in the cells. Before reassembling, check the ionizing wires and replace any that are broken. If the EAC has a drying unit, activate it before turning the system back on. Turn the power back on at the main disconnect.\n\nSome EACs will not operate until they are completely dry. Others may operate when wet but could experience arcing if the cells and pre-filters are damp. If the unit has a check LED, it may light when wet. To avoid problems, leave the EAC turned off for 2 to 3 h to allow complete drying.\n\nFor the dishwasher method, before using a dishwasher to clean the cells, check the dishwasher's manual as some manufacturers advise against washing electronic cells. If suitable, place the cells on the bottom rack with the airflow arrows pointing up, ensuring good water circulation. Do not place other items in the dishwasher with the cells. Use regular dishwashing detergent. Run the cells through a complete wash cycle but do not allow the dishwasher to run the dry cycle. The dry cycle can bake on any remaining contaminants and reduce an air cleaner's efficiency. Allow the cells to cool completely in the dishwasher. If removed while still warm, wear protective gloves to avoid burns. Be cautious, as hot water may accumulate in the tubes supporting the collector plates. Tip the cells to drain any accumulated water from the tubes. Gently wipe the ionizer wires and the contact board at the end of the cell with a small damp cloth. If dirt or residue remains in the dishwasher, run an empty wash cycle.\n\nFor the soaking method, use a container or utility sink large enough to fully immerse one or both cells. Fill the container with very hot water. Dissolve 3/4 cup of regular automatic dishwashing detergent per cell in the hot water. If the detergent does not dissolve easily or forms a scum, use softened water or try another brand. Once the detergent is fully dissolved, lower the cell(s) into the container and soak each cell for 15 to 20 min. Move the cells up and down a few times in the solution then remove the cells from the container. Rinse the cells thoroughly with a fine water spray. Soak them again in clean, hot water for 5 to 15 min to remove any remaining detergent. Stand the cells upright and allow them to drain and dry. Do not soak the cells in a bathtub, as their sharp edges may scratch the finish on the tub.\n\nThe fine tungsten wires in the charging section of the electronic cell are brittle and prone to breaking or damage. Show the customer how to inspect the cell from the upstream side to ensure no wires are broken or out of position. Broken wires can cause visible arcing or sparking, which indicates the need for replacement. Replacement wires are pre-cut to the correct length and have eyelets on both ends for easy installation. To replace broken wires, remove the broken wire ensuring all parts are fully removed, taking care not to damage the spring connector. Hook the eyelet of the replacement ionization wire onto the spring connector at one end of the cell. Hold the opposite eyelet with needle nose pliers and stretch the wire along the length of the cell. Depress the opposite spring connector and hook the eyelet onto it securely. Always ensure the power supply is turned off before performing maintenance on an EAC.\n\nWhile customers can clean cells and replace ionizing wires, all other maintenance and service must be performed by a trained gas technician/fitter. Before the beginning of the heating and cooling seasons, inspect the solid-state components and ionizing wires of the EAC. Always consult manufacturer instructions. Checking components requires a voltmeter or multimeter. Ensure the power from the main disconnect to the EAC is in the \"on\" position. To check the operation of the sail switch (or electrical blower interlock), energize the furnace blower. If the EAC does not operate, the sail switch may be faulty. Check to confirm that the voltage indicator light is on. If the light is not on but the unit operates, it is the light that is faulty. Press the test button on the EAC access door. Pushing the button shorts the hot side of the collector section to ground, producing one or more loud snapping sounds which indicates that the EAC is working properly. The test button also discharges the cells. Remove the access door. With the voltmeter or multimeter set to ac, check the voltage to the power pack. It should read 120 V ac. If the power pack is not working, you can replace the solid-state power supply within the power supply box. To charge particles, EACs operate at high voltage. Follow manufacturer instructions carefully when servicing them to avoid hazards.\n\nFor troubleshooting, investigate visible arcing or sparks and any strong ozone odour. If there is visible arcing or sparking, use an ohmmeter to check the cell for short circuits. Ensure the power to the EAC is turned off and cells are fully discharged. Measure the resistance between the frame of the cell and ionizer as well as between the frame of the cell and collector contacts. In both cases, the resistance should read as infinite. If a cell is sparking continuously in one place, reposition the plates per manufacturer's instructions. If the customer complains of an ozone odour, verify the air cleaner turns off when the furnace blower is inactive and ensure sufficient airflow is passing through the unit.\n\nUV light rays lie in the spectrum of light that is invisible to most humans. UV lights are designed to create a specific wavelength range within the electromagnetic spectrum of UV radiation. The common UV lamps used in air purification systems are: UVC (ultraviolet C) range is germicidal and commonly used for air sterilization, UVC lamps effectively destroy microorganisms that pass by the bulb including germs, viruses, bacteria, and fungi such as mould; VUV (vacuum UV) lights can help reduce gaseous contaminants and odours such as volatile organic compounds; UVA (ultraviolet A) combined with a catalyst reduces odours and chemicals.\n\nThe electromagnetic spectrum includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared light, visible light, ultraviolet light, X-rays, gamma rays, and cosmic rays. UV wavelengths range from 100 nm (vacuum UV ozone producing) to 400 nm (long wave UVA), with UVC (short wave germicidal) at 200-280 nm and UVB (middle wave) at 280-315 nm.\n\nUVC light is as harmful to the eyes as looking directly at the sun. Skin exposure can lead to burns and exposure to the blue light given off by UVC light bulbs can result in significant eye damage. UV light degrades plastic components and wire insulation, so ensure these materials are not exposed to UV light.\n\nThe basic UVC lamp device (germicidal UV lamp) is designed to fit into various locations within the supply or return air duct but is often installed near the cooling coil to reduce mould and bacteria in the coil fins, drain pans, and surrounding surfaces. Continuous operation of both the air handler motor and the UVC germicidal lamp ensures maximum exposure of airborne contaminants to UVC light. Advantages include: can destroy microorganisms such as germs, viruses, bacteria, and fungi including mould; helps prevent illnesses and diseases; does not produce ozone. Disadvantages include: no effect on particulates including most allergens; no effect on chemical fumes, gases, or cigarette smoke; degrades plastic, nylon, and rubber parts.\n\nUV lamps are integrated into systems that purify and filter air and are often combined with HEPA or charcoal filters. These systems can function as standalone units, partial bypass arrangements, or insert units. However, they do not replace the inline air filter which remains essential in protecting the fan. Different UV lights may be used depending on the type of air treatment being performed. Do not assume that all UV systems have germicidal capabilities. Some UV lights are designed to produce both UVC and VUV light. A VUV light unit produces a small amount of ozone which may be noticeable.",

          "content": "Chapter 2 covers humidifiers. Hard water can create various problems in humidifiers. Nozzles, tubes, and evaporative elements may accumulate precipitated solids and become clogged. Mineral solids that enter the air stream can, after distribution, leave a layer of white dust on furniture and floors throughout the home.\n\nSolutions to avoid hard water problems include: soften the humidifier's water (usually involves adding sodium to the water, however since sodium itself precipitates out in humidifier reservoirs over time, ensure that the reservoir is periodically flushed out); add chemicals to the humidifier pan that prevent scaling (mineral precipitation), however consult the manufacturer's literature before adding any chemicals; connect to the water supply by installing a full-size tee fitting and approved valve on the water line.\n\nFor a copper water tubing system, a saddle valve may come with the installation package from the humidifier manufacturer. Though considered \"easy to install\", this type of connection is not recommended as the saddle valve is prone to failure and can cause enormous property damage. In Ontario, the Ontario Building Code states that a saddle valve \"shall not be installed\".\n\nAtomizing humidifiers installed in a duct or plenum must operate only when the furnace blower is operating. These humidifiers introduce droplets of water into the ducts, which can lead to problems. Without air movement, water droplets can settle on duct surfaces and cause moisture accumulation. Standing moisture creates a breeding ground for mildew, which compromises indoor air quality. Moisture can cause corrosion. An electrical interlock is required to ensure that an atomizing humidifier works only when the blower is operating. This is accomplished by installing a sail switch in the return air duct. When the blower is energized, air movement causes a fin on the sail switch to move, closing a set of electrical contacts to the atomizing humidifier and energizing it.\n\nIn contrast, evaporative (wetted element) humidifiers can operate independently of the furnace, so no interlock is required. Power bypass humidifiers include a transformer. A humidifier must not be connected to the transformer (if there is one) on the furnace because this could overload the furnace transformer. A humidifier transformer should not be wired into the thermostat circuit. If it was, the thermostat would receive a different current draw if the humidistat calls for moisture. If a humidifier transformer is installed on a furnace with a direct drive motor, the wiring and control system must prevent the humidifier transformer from overvoltage created by the motor's idle windings. Follow all manufacturer's wiring diagrams.\n\nMake modifications to the sheet metal when a humidifier is installed in or under a duct, in a plenum, or in a bypass duct. Follow manufacturer's instructions regarding the size of the openings required and proper sealing of openings for the specific humidifier.\n\nIdeally all the water flowing into a humidifying unit would evaporate; in reality however, there is usually leftover water. The common solution for leftover water is to provide a drain tube, but this means that the humidifier must have access to a drainpipe. In some designs, the water is retained and recycled until it all evaporates. The pros of this approach include the drainless design and conservation of water; the cons include the increased need for cleaning and maintenance and the potential for mould growth if the water is allowed to sit.\n\nPrior to the start of the heating season, the operation of the humidifier should be checked at the same time as the forced-air furnace is inspected. It is particularly important to make sure that the humidifier is clean before the heating season starts. If water remains in a humidifier for an extended period (e.g., over the summer), it creates a breeding environment for fungi, bacteria, algae, and viruses. If the reservoir is not cleaned before the furnace blower is turned on, these microorganisms may be distributed throughout the house, resulting in reduced indoor air quality and increased indoor air pollution.\n\nCommon operational requirements include correct water level (if too high, water can overflow into ducts causing corrosion and mildew, must be set to manufacturer's specifications), float valve assembly operating (must be working and adjusted properly to maintain correct water level), working humidistat (check operation with independent measurement such as sling psychrometer), and clean overflow/drain line and reservoir pan (hose may need removal for cleaning, ensure drain not blocked, clean reservoir pan at beginning and end of heating season or more frequently if slimy, ensure customer understands cleaning per manufacturer instructions).\n\nService guidelines vary by type. Wetted-element humidifiers: if mounted on drum or paddle, must turn for correct operation, clean or replace media at start of each season, keep pad clean for proper water absorption and evaporation, wash with detergent if cleanable, lightly scrape mineral deposits with putty knife if needed, replace pad if no longer conforms to drum after cleaning. Atomizing humidifiers: confirm nozzle sprays freely and drum rotates. Steam humidifiers: verify steam generation, check for nozzle blockages, check steam hose for low spots and ensure slopes continuously upward from humidifier to dispersion tube, if dispersion tube below humidifier inspect drip tee drain and trap, examine canister for loose electrical connections. Wetted-element spray humidifiers: inspect spray nozzles for dirt or mineral deposits. Drum-type humidifiers: clutch assembly must be inspected and cleaned regularly, clean mineral deposits from clutch assembly, clean drain pan, clean orifice between water source and float valve, turn on blower, set humidistat to call, confirm motor rotates properly, adjust water level screw.\n\nCustomer seasonal maintenance instructions: Fall: clean media pad before heating season begins (if applicable), clean reservoir with vinegar and water (if applicable), open bypass duct damper (if bypass type), check and adjust float level as needed, set humidistat to desired relative humidity approximately 40%. Winter: check windows for condensation indicating excess humidity and adjust as necessary, periodically check water level. Summer: drain humidifier reservoir, close bypass duct damper (if applicable).\n\nWhen a customer reports lack of humidity, check the relative humidity in the conditioned space using a sling psychrometer and troubleshoot the humidifier, especially the humidistat, water supply, and electrical system. In extreme weather conditions, few humidifiers can provide the desired humidity level.\n\nA sling psychrometer is used to measure air temperature using two thermometers (wet bulb and dry bulb) mounted on a base with a handle that allows it to rotate rapidly in the air. As the psychrometer moves, air flows over the thermometers. Moisture evaporates from the wet bulb. Once temperatures stabilize on the two thermometers, readings are taken from both and compared with tables to find the relative humidity. Modern electronic devices can measure relative humidity without requiring a sling action, making them more convenient. These devices operate based on temperature of condensation, changes in electrical resistance, and changes in electrical capacitance. A digital psychrometer provides quick and accurate relative humidity measurements.\n\nTroubleshooting the humidifier includes checking the humidistat (set to higher level to verify activation, if functioning but not calling for correct RH may be incorrectly calibrated, recalibrate or replace, if outdoor temperature reading not accurate ensure sensor securely connected, check location and mounting, measure resistance and compare to manufacturer table), water supply (ensure supply line not plugged and float valve adjusted properly, if float damaged replace immediately, if overflows and level/float correct the seat on entire float assembly may need replacement, for wetted element ensure medium not clogged/dirty/saturated with minerals, clean if possible or replace, replace damaged elements to prevent liquid water entering ducts, for atomizing verify drum turning and spray nozzle not blocked), and electrical connections (check circuit breakers, humidistat, low-voltage controls, if motor check if burned out or malfunctioning, mineral deposits may cause thermal fault overload protector to open shutting unit off, clean or replace component).\n\nOther potential problems that should be addressed include excessive dust (white due to mineral buildup, clean or replace media), moisture in ducts (atomizing humidifier operating when blower not on, ensure synchronized to operate only when blower on and furnace operating, verify will not operate in \"fan only\" mode as heat required to evaporate droplets), and water overflow (inspect float valve for proper adjustment, clean/replace/adjust valve, check drainage/overflow line for blockages).",

          "content": "Chapter 3 covers cooling coils. Refrigeration and air conditioning mechanics (not gas technicians/fitters) are responsible for the installation and major servicing of cooling coils used with gas-fired forced-air furnaces. However, a gas technician/fitter must inspect and clean the cooling coils as part of regular furnace servicing.\n\nNormal air temperature rise or drop is the difference between supply and return air temperatures. A cooling coil (sometimes called an \"A-coil\" because of its shape) can be added to a forced-air furnace, which enables it to function as a central air conditioner. While air conditioning technicians handle the installation and servicing of air conditioning units, gas technicians/fitters are responsible for cleaning the cooling coil as part of regular furnace maintenance. A dirty coil (like a dirty furnace filter) can restrict airflow.\n\nThis type of air conditioning system consists of a cooling coil (evaporator) and a condenser. The cooling coil may be mounted in the supply plenum or housed in a cabinet located between the supply plenum and the duct. The condenser is usually located outside the building.\n\nThis type of air conditioning system works as follows. Two lines circulate refrigerant between the A-coil and condenser coil. The compressor moves the refrigerant around the loop. As the furnace forces air through the A-coil, the coil absorbs heat from the air, causing the liquid refrigerant to evaporate into vapour. The vapour moves to the condenser coil, where heat is released outdoors, causing the refrigerant vapour to return to its liquid state. The liquid refrigerant then returns to the cooling coil.\n\nThe refrigerant vapor compression cycle includes a low pressure side (evaporator, expansion device with liquid/vapor mix, saturated/subcooled liquid) and a high pressure side (compressor, condenser with superheated vapor, saturated/subcooled vapor). Cooling coil units are available for upflow, downflow, and horizontal furnaces. The coil is housed in a cabinet. Possible locations of the cooling coil cabinet vary by furnace type.\n\nTo measure either the temperature drop across a cooling coil or the temperature rise across the heat exchanger, punch or drill holes in the supply and return air plenums, aiming to position the holes about 3 ft from the furnace when possible. Insert a thermometer into the airflow through each hole. Most good-quality electronic multimeters have a temperature probe accessory or a pocket digital thermometer that can be used. Operate the equipment with the fan running for about 5 min to establish the normal air temperature rise or drop (which is the difference between supply air temperature and return air temperature). To calculate temperature drop across the coil, subtract the supply-side temperature from the return-side temperature. To calculate temperature rise across the heat exchanger, subtract the return-side temperature from the supply-side temperature.\n\nTo diagnose temperature change, note that the temperature drop across the cooling coil is about 11 °C (20 °F) when it is operating at typical condition of 24 °C (75 °F) and 50% relative humidity. If the measured temperature drop is too low, inspect the cooling coil unit and clean it if necessary. Check the blower and adjust it as required. Refer to the manufacturer's manual for the correct temperature drop and air volume. Clean the unit and retest the temperature drop before adjusting the blower speed. If needed, adjust the blower speed to obtain the correct pressure drop and air volume. If the blower is not operating correctly, you will need to refer the customer to a refrigeration and air conditioning mechanic to troubleshoot the cooling system.\n\nThe surfaces of the cooling coil must be clean to maintain system performance and efficiency. A dirty coil can cause several problems including: during the cooling season, the coil will not deliver its full cooling capacity; the airflow to the building will be reduced; during the heating season, both the temperature rise across the furnace and the stack temperature may increase. The coil must be visually inspected for cleanliness as part of regular furnace maintenance. If the coil is located in a cabinet, an access door is typically included in the case coil cabinet. If mounted in the plenum, it may be necessary to cut an inspection port (if so, be careful not to damage the coil).\n\nThe cooling coil requires cleaning when it is dirty. A gas technician/fitter is responsible for cleaning the exterior of the coil and the fins through which air is forced over the coil. Cleaning procedures may differ by unit. Always consult manufacturer instructions for specifics.\n\nA typical cleaning procedure includes: check the fins for accumulated dirt or dust, if the fins are clogged or dirty clean them using a vacuum cleaner, compressed air or nitrogen, or a brush or a fin comb (handle tools carefully to avoid damaging the coil); inspect the tubing and connections for signs of oil leaks (look for oil spots, if you find leaks refer the necessary repair to an air conditioning technician); clean the outer surfaces of lines using a vacuum cleaner or brush to remove dirt, wash the outer surfaces with low-pressure water and mild detergent if necessary; check and clean the condensate drain system; remove any accumulated dust or dirt from the drip tray, probe the drain hole with a screwdriver to ensure it is not clogged, pour a small amount of water into the drip tray and confirm proper drainage, blow out clogged drains with compressed air or nitrogen.",

They are made from such media as fibreglass \nand positioned in the air stream.\nAir is forced through the filter and particles removed. The filter \nmedia can be reusable or disposable.\nMedia filters of high, low, and medium efficiency are available.\nElectrostatic Air Filters\nThese are media filters made from a material that generates a \nstatic charge in response to air flow.\nThe static charge attracts and holds more particles than media \nfilters to the medium.\nElectronic Air Cleaners (EAC)\nThey use an electrostatic charge to remove and collect \nparticulate contaminants from the circulated air system.\nAn EAC uses an external power source to generate the charge \nthat attracts particles to charged plates, rather than a media \nfilter, to collect them.\nUV Air Purifier\nUse UV light to reduce biological contaminants, chemical, and \nodours. UV is not a filtration method, but can be incorporated \ninto filtration systems.\nUnderstanding MERV Ratings\nWhat is MERV?\nThe minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) is a numerical value given to furnace filters to identify the filtering ability.\nThe MERV rating system is now an international industry standard that helps determine a furnace filter's ability to capture and hold dirt \nand dust in specific size ranges.\nRating Scale\nMERV ratings range from 1–20. The higher the MERV rating, the greater the filtering capability. Measurements are in microns.\nApplications\nHigh-efficiency particulate air (HEPA), MERV 17–20, or high-efficiency particulate arrestance filters, which remove a very high \npercentage of airborne contaminants, are often specified for various commercial, industrial, and institutional applications.\nResidential Use\nA MERV rating between eight and 11 is adequate for most homes. To be safe, it is best to check if the furnace manufacturer has a \nmaximum MERV rating for the model of furnace being used.\nPressure Drop Considerations\nWhat is Pressure Drop?\nThe pressure drop that the filter \ncauses should undergo assessment \nfor suitability with fan units prior to \nuse to ensure maintenance of duct \nstatic pressures.\nAs filters become more efficient \n(higher MERV ratings), they typically \ncreate more resistance to airflow, \nwhich can affect system performance.\nImpact on System\nToo much pressure drop can cause:\n•\nReduced airflow through the \nsystem\n•\nDecreased heating and cooling \nefficiency\n•\nIncreased energy consumption\n•\nPotential damage to the furnace \ncomponents\nFinding Balance\nThe ideal filter provides adequate \nfiltration while maintaining proper \nairflow through the system.\nAlways consult manufacturer \nspecifications for maximum allowable \npressure drop in the system.\nSources of Indoor Air Particles\nHousehold Dust\nDust on floors or other \nsurfaces that is disturbed by \nactivity in the house\nCombustion Sources\nDust generated by smoking, \nburning candles, cooking, \ndoing laundry, etc.\nBiological Sources\nHair and skin flakes from \nhumans or pets\nOutdoor Sources\nParticles from the outside air \nthat come into the home \nwith infiltrating air\nHealth Impacts of Airborne Particles\nVisible Particles\nParticles of dust that accumulate on a television screen, shelves, and furniture are visible to the eyes\nRespirable Particles\nSome particles are so small that they are inhaled and then exhaled without \nbeing trapped in the lungs\nHarmful Particles\nThe particles most dangerous to humans are those that \nenter the lungs and lodge there\nAlthough an occupant would probably like to keep visible dust out of a home, the main health risk comes from unseen/unsafe \nparticles which include tobacco smoke, spores, bacteria, and viruses.\nChoosing the Right Air Filtration System\nAir Quality Requirements\nConsider the degree of air cleanliness required for the \nspecific application\nDust Conditions\nEvaluate the amount and type of dust in the air to be \nfiltered\nAirflow Resistance\nConsider the operating resistance to air flow (pressure \ndrop)\nSpace Constraints\nAssess the space available for filtration equipment\nCost Factors\nEvaluate initial costs, ongoing maintenance costs, and \noperating costs\nSystem Lifespan\nConsider the predicted life and efficiency of the \nsystem\nRelative Costs of Air Filter Types\nFilter\nMaintenance and \ncapital costs, per \nyear, over 15 years \n($)\nAmount of clean \nair produced \n(litres/second)\nCost of clean air \nper year \n($/liters/second)\n25 mm pleated\n48\n17\n3.36\n25 mm premium\n100\n97\n1.13\nCharged media\n43\n44\n1.25\n100 mm pleated\n100\n60\n1.71\nHEPA bypass\n240\n175\n2.03\nESP\n67\n298\n0.26\nSource: Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC)\nTypes of Media Filters\nHammock Filters\nLocated on a frame or \nhammock that \nsurrounds the fan in \nthe forced-air furnace\nIf a forced-air furnace \nis intended to be used \nwith a hammock filter, \nthe filter holder will be \nfactory installed\nSlab Filters\nConsist of layers of \nfilter material, usually \nfibreglass, held in place \nby a cardboard frame\nThe fibres are treated \nwith oil or a similar \nadhesive\nMost slab filters are \ndesigned for one-time \nuse and must be \ndiscarded when they \nare dirty\nPleated Filters\nRepresent the most \npopular type of filter \nchoice available today\nCome in a variety of \nsizes and thicknesses\nPaper pleating \nincreases the filter \nsurface and improves \nperformance\nHammock Filter\nDescription\nHammock filters are located on a frame \nor hammock that surrounds the fan in the \nforced-air furnace.\nThe filter material is typically disposable \nand requires periodic replacement.\nInstallation\nIf a forced-air furnace is intended to be \nused with a hammock filter, the filter \nholder will be factory installed.\nThe filter material is secured to the frame \nwith screws or clips that can be loosened \nfor replacement.\nMaintenance\nRegular inspection and replacement of \nthe filter material is necessary.\nOne side of the media is usually coated \nwith oil to enhance particle collection. \nThis coated side should be opposite the \nblower.\nSlab and Pleated Filters\nFilter Rack Installation\nLocate the Installation Position\nIdentify the location of the racks.

The \nfilter rack is usually located between the furnace casing and the return-\nair plenum.\nImpact of Filters on Air Flow\nResistance to Air Flow\nAll media filters, whether mechanical or electrostatic, add resistance to air flow.\nThickness Considerations\nThe thickness of the filter and the specifications for the furnace must match. Adding extra filters to the filter chamber to \nimprove indoor air quality can seriously impede furnace operation.\nPrimary Purpose\nThe main purpose of the furnace inline filter is to protect the blower fan and heat exchanger from the dust, hair, and other \nparticles the return duct pulls in.\nOperational Issues\nAs a filter fills with particles, the air volume flowing through the filter decreases. Restrictions in air flow can cause problems in \nheating cycles, causing the furnace to switch off on the high limit control and seriously limit the furnace's ability to heat the \nhouse.\nPartial Bypass Air HE",

The filter media can be reusable or disposable.\nMedia filters of high, low, and medium efficiency are available.\nElectrostatic Air Filters\nThese are media filters made from a material that generates a static charge in response to air flow.\nThe static charge attracts and holds more particles than media filters to the medium.\nElectronic Air Cleaners (EAC)\nThey use an electrostatic charge to remove and collect particulate contaminants from the circulated air system.\nAn EAC uses an external power source to generate the charge that attracts particles to charged plates, rather than a media filter, to collect them.\nUV Air Purifier\nUse UV light to reduce biological contaminants, chemical, and odours. UV is not a filtration method, but can be incorporated into filtration systems.\nUnderstanding MERV Ratings\nWhat is MERV?\nThe minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) is a numerical value given to furnace filters to identify the filtering ability.\nThe MERV rating system is now an international industry standard that helps determine a furnace filter's ability to capture and hold dirt and dust in specific size ranges.\nRating Scale\nMERV ratings range from 1–20. The higher the MERV rating, the greater the filtering capability. Measurements are in microns.\nApplications\nHigh-efficiency particulate air (HEPA), MERV 17–20, or high-efficiency particulate arrestance filters, which remove a very high percentage of airborne contaminants, are often specified for various commercial, industrial, and institutional applications.\nResidential Use\nA MERV rating between eight and 11 is adequate for most homes. To be safe, it is best to check if the furnace manufacturer has a maximum MERV rating for the model of furnace being used.\nPressure Drop Considerations\nWhat is Pressure Drop?\nThe pressure drop that the filter causes should undergo assessment for suitability with fan units prior to use to ensure maintenance of duct static pressures.\nAs filters become more efficient (higher MERV ratings), they typically create more resistance to airflow, which can affect system performance.\nImpact on System\nToo much pressure drop can cause:\nReduced airflow through the system\nDecreased heating and cooling efficiency\nIncreased energy consumption\nPotential damage to the furnace components\nFinding Balance\nThe ideal filter provides adequate filtration while maintaining proper airflow through the system.\nAlways consult manufacturer specifications for maximum allowable pressure drop in the system.\nSources of Indoor Air Particles\nHousehold Dust\nDust on floors or other surfaces that is disturbed by activity in the house\nCombustion Sources\nDust generated by smoking, burning candles, cooking, doing laundry, etc.\nBiological Sources\nHair and skin flakes from humans or pets\nOutdoor Sources\nParticles from the outside air that come into the home with infiltrating air\nHealth Impacts of Airborne Particles\nVisible Particles\nParticles of dust that accumulate on a television screen, shelves, and furniture are visible to the eyes\nRespirable Particles\nSome particles are so small that they are inhaled and then exhaled without being trapped in the lungs\nHarmful Particles\nThe particles most dangerous to humans are those that enter the lungs and lodge there\nAlthough an occupant would probably like to keep visible dust out of a home, the main health risk comes from unseen/unsafe particles which include tobacco smoke, spores, bacteria, and viruses.\nChoosing the Right Air Filtration System\nAir Quality Requirements\nConsider the degree of air cleanliness required for the specific application\nDust Conditions\nEvaluate the amount and type of dust in the air to be filtered\nAirflow Resistance\nConsider the operating resistance to air flow (pressure drop)\nSpace Constraints\nAssess the space available for filtration equipment\nCost Factors\nEvaluate initial costs, ongoing maintenance costs, and operating costs\nSystem Lifespan\nConsider the predicted life and efficiency of the system\nRelative Costs of Air Filter Types\nFilter\nMaintenance and capital costs, per year, over 15 years ($)\nAmount of clean air produced (litres/second)\nCost of clean air per year ($/liters/second)\n25 mm pleated\n48\n17\n3.36\n25 mm premium\n100\n97\n1.13\nCharged media\n43\n44\n1.25\n100 mm pleated\n100\n60\n1.71\nHEPA bypass\n240\n175\n2.03\nESP\n67\n298\n0.26\nSource: Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC)\nTypes of Media Filters\nHammock Filters\nLocated on a frame or hammock that surrounds the fan in the forced-air furnace\nIf a forced-air furnace is intended to be used with a hammock filter, the filter holder will be factory installed\nSlab Filters\nConsist of layers of filter material, usually fibreglass, held in place by a cardboard frame\nThe fibres are treated with oil or a similar adhesive\nMost slab filters are designed for one-time use and must be discarded when they are dirty\nPleated Filters\nRepresent the most popular type of filter choice available today\nCome in a variety of sizes and thicknesses\nPaper pleating increases the filter surface and improves performance\nHammock Filter\nDescription\nHammock filters are located on a frame or hammock that surrounds the fan in the forced-air furnace.\nThe filter material is typically disposable and requires periodic replacement.\nInstallation\nIf a forced-air furnace is intended to be used with a hammock filter, the filter holder will be factory installed.\nThe filter material is secured to the frame with screws or clips that can be loosened for replacement.\nMaintenance\nRegular inspection and replacement of the filter material is necessary.\nOne side of the media is usually coated with oil to enhance particle collection. This coated side should be opposite the blower.\nSlab and Pleated Filters\nSlab Filters\nConsist of layers of filter material, usually fibreglass, held in place by a cardboard frame.\nThe fibres are treated with oil or a similar adhesive. Filters for residential use are usually about one inch thick.\nMost slab filters are designed for one-time use and must be discarded when they are dirty.\nPleated Filters\nRepresent the most popular type of filter choice available today. They come in a variety of sizes and thicknesses.\nPaper pleating increases the filter surface and improves performance.\nA 5 inch depth pleated media filter can replace an electronic air filter and reside in the same cabinet, or a custom air filter rack can be installed to accommodate the size.\nFilter Rack Installation\nLocate the Installation Position\nIdentify the location of the racks. The side of the furnace cabinet will likely have embossed angles indicating the location.\nCut the Return Opening\nCut the return opening using the angles as guides.\nMount the Filter Rack\nMount the filter rack over the opening.\nComplete Ductwork\nProceed with the ductwork installation.\nHolding the filter in position requires the installation of a filter rack. The filter rack is usually located between the furnace casing and the return-air plenum.\nImpact of Filters on Air Flow\nResistance to Air Flow\nAll media filters, whether mechanical or electrostatic, add resistance to air flow.\nThickness Considerations\nThe thickness of the filter and the specifications for the furnace must match.
