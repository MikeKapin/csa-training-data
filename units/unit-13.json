          "content": "Control systems for gas-fired equipment use various physical principles and electronic components to maintain safe and efficient operation.\n\nOven Safety Valves:\n\nElectric oven gas valves are safety devices allowing gas flow only when HSI (Hot Surface Igniter - glow bar) circuit is energized and creating adequate current.\n\nOperation: Thermostat, glow bar igniter, and gas safety valve wired in series. Electricity must pass through glow bar then to safety valve. Glow bar blocks current through electrical resistance, which declines as bar's temperature rises.\n\nWhen bar reaches yellow heat (sufficient to ignite gas): Allows passage of enough electricity to open gas valve.\n\nImportant: HSI must warm up sufficiently before enough electricity can pass to open gas valve (TRUE).\n\nSeismic Gas Valves:\n\nPurpose: Shut off gas supply to building during earthquake. Prevents gas from escaping from downstream lines ruptured during quake, minimizing chance of gas fire.\n\nDesign features:\n- Must be installed level\n- Internal ball that rolls when subject to horizontal vibration\n- Indicating window\n- Manual reset required once activated\n\nReset: Seismic valve does NOT reset automatically once vibration stops (FALSE - manual reset required).\n\nFire Suppression Gas Valves:\n\nPurpose: Shut off gas supply to commercial cooking equipment if there is fire.\n\nActivation: By cable connected to fire suppression system\n\nReset: Manual reset required\n\nSystem components:\n- Release-to-close valve (held open by cable)\n- Manual pull station\n- Temperature-activated fusible link above cooking equipment\n\nEither manual pull or fusible link releases cable and extinguishing agent.\n\nCable release fire suppression valves: Can be activated manually OR automatically (FALSE - not only manually, also by fusible link).\n\nOperating Principles:\n\nTemperature disc, bimetallic strip, and rod-and-tube controls: All operate on principle of thermal expansion of solids (not electromagnetism, not thermoelectric effect, not thermal expansion of liquids).\n\nSealed bellows controls: Operate on principle of thermal expansion of liquids (not electromagnetism, thermoelectric effect, or thermal expansion of solids).\n\nSolenoids: Operate on principle of electromagnetism (not thermoelectric effect, not thermal expansion).\n\nThermocouples and thermopiles: Operate on principle of thermoelectric effect (not electromagnetism, not thermal expansion).\n\nMercury in capillary tubes: NOT suitable for high temperature operations (FALSE). Mercury expands predictably with temperature but has limitations.\n\nControl Components That Produce Electricity:\n\nThermocouple: Produces electricity when heated (not transistor, not thermistor, not bimetallic strip).\n\nSolid-State Electronic Devices:\n\nMade up of semiconductor materials WITHOUT moving electro-mechanical components (FALSE - do NOT have components that move).\n\nSemiconductor Devices:\n\nTransistor: Semiconductor device used to switch or amplify signals (not diode, not thermistor, not thermocouple).\n\nDiode: Semiconductor device allowing flow of current in only one direction (not transistor, not thermistor, not thermocouple).\n\nThermistor: Semiconductor device that changes its electrical resistance with change in temperature (not diode, not transistor, not thermocouple).\n\n10K thermistor: Has reference resistance of 10 kΩ at temperature of 25°C (not -55°C, not 0°C, not 150°C).\n\nPTC thermistor: Does NOT decrease resistance with increase in temperature (FALSE - PTC means Positive Temperature Coefficient, resistance INCREASES with temperature).\n\nNTC thermistor: DOES decrease resistance with increase in temperature (Negative Temperature Coefficient).\n\nThyristor: Different from transistor in that it only needs pulse signal to make it conduct and will continue to conduct without needing further signals (TRUE).\n\nSCR, TRIAC, and DIAC: Are thyristor types of electronic devices (not diode, not transistor, not thermistor).\n\nControl System Sections:\n\nOperating Controllers:\n\nThermostat, operating aquastat, and operating pressuretrol belong to: Operating controllers section (not ignition control module, not limit/safety controllers, not combustion safety controller).\n\nLimit and Safety Controllers:\n\nLow-water cutoff, gas-pressure switch, and flow switch belong to: Limit and safety controllers section (not operating controllers, not ignition control module, not combustion safety controller).\n\nThermostat Installation:\n\nPosition and location are important factors (TRUE).\n\nShould thermostats be placed on wall connecting with exterior? NO (FALSE - should be on interior wall away from exterior walls, drafts, heat sources).\n\nOperating Aquastat:\n\nAn NO (Normally Open) switch that turns on gas supply when temperature setpoint is reached (not NC shutting off gas, not NC turning on gas, not NO shutting off gas).\n\nOperating Pressuretrol:\n\nPurpose: To start boiler when steam pressure drops (not to stop if pressure gets too high - that's limit pressuretrol, not shut off gas for overpressure in valve train, not underpressure in valve train).\n\nCombustion Safety Controls:\n\nThermocouple: IS considered combustion safety control (TRUE - prevents gas flow if pilot flame is out).\n\nFlame Ionization Principle:\n\nFlame rod (flame rectifier): Works on principle of flame ionization (not thermopile, not infrared sensor, not ultraviolet sensor).\n\nAir-Proving Switch:\n\nUsed to sense: Combustion air or flue gas flow on any appliance that incorporates fan or blower (not flow switch, not pressuretrol, not gas pressure switch).\n\nIgnition Control Modules:\n\nNon-integrated ignition control modules (DSI, HSI, intermittent pilot): Do NOT manage all other appliance activities like humidistat, electronic filters, heating pumps, or fans (FALSE - only manage ignition, not all appliance functions).\n\nIntegrated Furnace Controls (IFC): DO manage entire appliance operation including humidifier, electronic air cleaner, variable fan speed, etc.\n\nRod-and-Tube Valves:\n\nTypically installed on: Gas water heaters (not gas range, not gas boiler, not gas furnace).\n\nCommon application: Unitrol valves on residential water heaters.\n\nField Wiring on IFC Schematic:\n\nIndicated by: Dotted lines (not solid lines, not highlighting, not solid bold lines).\n\nSolid lines: Represent factory wiring\n\nDIP Switch:\n\nDefinition: Manual electric switch packaged with others in a group (not direct ignition proving sensor, not air flow differential pressure switch, not double pole double throw automatic switch).\n\nUsed to set operating parameters like heat off delay, trial for ignition, heat on delay, stage delay, cool off delay.\n\nPilot-Operated Solenoid Valves:\n\nUse pressure differentials to assist plunger to open and close main valve (TRUE).\n\nAdvantages: Can control larger ports with smaller solenoid, more energy efficient.\n\nServo Regulator:\n\nIn combination gas valve: Functions as appliance regulator (not system regulator, not service regulator, not overpressure protection regulator).\n\nPurpose: Regulates manifold pressure to burners.\n\nECO (Energy Cut-Off):\n\nBackup safety designed to shut off burner if water temperature in heater exceeds 200°F (not T&P, not pilotstat, not aquastat).\n\nCommon on water heaters as thermal protection.\n\nRedundant Gas Valve:\n\nSecond automatic shut-off valve: Acts as extra protection on redundant gas valve (not on-off switch, not pilot adjustment, not servo regulator).\n\nProvides double safety shutoff capability.\n\nElectronic Thermostats:\n\nControl temperature swing overshoot via: CPH (Cycles Per Hour) method (not night setback, not millivolt anticipator, not adjustable heat anticipator).\n\nMost electronic thermostats preset at CPH setting of: 3 (ranges typically 1-9, but common preset is 3 cycles per hour, which would be option \"not listed\" but in range 1-2, 4-5, 7-8, 10-11 - likely 4-5 is closest common setting shown).\n\nMulti-Stage Thermostats:\n\nMethod employing algorithms to anticipate demand: Rate-of-change staging (not CPH staging, not setpoint staging, not time-based staging).\n\nAnalyzes how quickly temperature changes to predict heating needs.\n\nWireless Temperature Sensors:\n\nShort-range protocols (Z-Wave, Zigbee): Achieve longer range through mesh network (not hard wire, not AC adapters, not signal boosters).\n\nMesh network: Each device acts as repeater, extending overall network range.\n\nSmart Valves:\n\nAdvantage: Do NOT use regular 110V AC HSI (FALSE - smart valves typically use low-voltage DC HSI for safety and control).\n\nRedundant Gas Valves:\n\nCan be adapted for modulating operation by: Electric stepper motor (not Wi-Fi-enabled, not servo regulated, not electro-hydraulic actuator).\n\nStepper motor gradually opens/closes valve for proportional control.",

          "content": "Understanding electrical sequences and relay operations is essential for troubleshooting and servicing gas-fired equipment control systems.\n\nTransformer Phasing:\n\nDefinition: Matching polarity of primary and secondary sides of transformer (not modulating, not sequencing, not polarization).\n\nFor AC circuits: Term phasing refers to difference between hot, neutral wire and ground wire.\n\nChecking Phasing Procedure:\n\nNeed voltmeter to check transformer phasing.\n\nSteps:\n1. Identify hot lead (L1) in junction box, connect to black lead of transformer\n2. Connect neutral lead (L2) to white lead of transformer\n3. Connect one side of transformer secondary to ground\n4. Check voltage between hot (L1) and ungrounded side of secondary\n\nIn-Phase Reading: Should read 96V AC (not 24V, not 120V, not 144V)\n\nOut-of-Phase Reading: Will read 144V AC\n\nIf out of phase (144V reading):\n- Move ground to other terminal of secondary\n- Recheck - should now read 96V\n- Have now identified proper secondary terminal to use as \"hot\" (R)\n\nAlternative method: Some transformers have secondary terminals labeled C (common - grounded) and R (hot). If out of phase, switch leads on primary (120V AC) connections.\n\nOnce in phase: Connect hot (R) and grounded (C) sides of secondary to appropriate terminals on control module.\n\nElectrical Sequence of Operation:\n\nGas technician must be able to determine operating sequence based on electrical circuitry provided by manufacturer.\n\nLadder Diagrams:\n\nLeft-hand side represents: Incoming voltage (TRUE - typically labeled L1 for hot)\n\nRight-hand side: Return path, neutral (typically labeled N or L2)\n\nLadder diagram is also known as: Schematic diagram (not P&C drawing, not component layout, not connection diagram)\n\nWiring Diagram:\n\nConsidered to be like \"map\" of electrical circuit. Shows physical connections between components. Best for locating components and tracing wires.\n\nSchematic/Ladder Diagram:\n\nBest to use to determine: How current flows through various parts of circuit. Shows logical sequence of operation.\n\nSwitches and Loads:\n\nSwitches connected to loads: Normally located on hot line, never in neutral line (except rare manufacturer-specific designs).\n\nTypical furnace circuits include:\n\nLine Voltage - 120V:\n- Appliance disconnect (NC) - not shown\n- Door switch (NC)\n- Limit switch (NC)\n- Transformer 120/24V\n\nFan Circuits - 120V:\n- Door switch (NC)\n- Furnace relay contacts (NO)\n- Induced blower motor (120V)\n- Circulating air blower motor (120V)\n- Combination fan (NO) and limit control (NC) switch\n\nControl Circuit - 24V:\n- Thermostat (NO)\n- Flame rollout switch (NC)\n- Vent safety switch (NC)\n- Air-proving switch (NO)\n- Furnace relay solenoid\n- Control module (acts as both load and switching device)\n\nTypical Sequence Example:\n\n1. Door switch and limit switch closed: Powers 120/24V transformer\n2. Thermostat calls for heat: Thermostat switch closes\n3. Powers furnace relay coil: Closes furnace relay contacts\n4. Contacts power induced blower motor\n5. Running induced blower: Causes air-proving switch to close\n6. Powers control module (flame rollout and vent switch normally closed)\n7. Control module performs safe start check: Confirms no existing flame\n8. If safe start indicated: Igniter and pilot valve powered simultaneously\n9. Pilot proven through flame sensor\n10. If pilot proven: Main valve powered, igniter de-energized\n11. Main burner firing\n12. Temperature rises to fan control setpoint: Fan control switch closes\n13. Circulating blower motor energized\n14. Burner continues until thermostat satisfied\n15. Circulating blower continues after thermostat opens until temperature drops below fan control differential\n\nSafe Start Check:\n\nPurpose: To confirm there is not already an existing flame (not to confirm pilot flame, not main flame, not induced fan running).\n\nPrevents ignition attempt if flame already present.\n\nFlame Rollout Switch:\n\nOperation: NC (Normally Closed) switch that opens on flame rollout (not NO that breaks on rollout, not NO that closes when induced fan runs, not NC that closes when induced fan stops).\n\nSafety device detecting flame escaping from heat exchanger.\n\nRelays:\n\nMost common auxiliary devices in control systems: Relays (not switches, not contactors, not protective devices).\n\nUsed to control high-power circuits with low-power signals.\n\nAFL Rating:\n\nAFL = Amp Full Load rating for relay contacts\n\nFor 120V circuit NC contacts: Check table for proper rating (example shows 13.8-82.8A range depending on HP)\n\nIntegrated Electronic Control Boards:\n\nHave replaced most time delay relays (TRUE).\n\nModern IFCs incorporate timing functions electronically rather than with mechanical time-delay relays.\n\nIntegrated Furnace Control (IFC) Sequences:\n\nIFC manages entire furnace operation:\n- Ignition control\n- Two-stage burner operation\n- Variable fan speed\n- Electronic air cleaner\n- Humidifier\n\nCannot determine sequence for all IFC-connected components from wiring diagram alone (TRUE - need manufacturer operating instructions).\n\nSequence information: Must come from operating instructions, often provided as graphical table.\n\nGraphical Sequence Tables:\n\nShow:\n- Stages across top row\n- Loads and switches that change in left column\n- Lines move vertically to indicate status change at appropriate stage\n- Two-stage furnaces show extra upward movement for second stage (gas valve, inducer, blower increase)\n\nDIP Switch Configurations:\n\nIFC manufactured for different furnace models/makes. Require adjustable timing options.\n\nDIP switches change operating parameters:\n- Heat off delay\n- Trial for ignition\n- Heat on delay\n- Stage delay (for single-stage thermostat)\n- Cool off delay\n\nWhen replacing IFC: Match DIP switch configuration to original IFC or manufacturer specifications.\n\nExample DIP Switch Reading:\n\nHeat off delay setting: Determined by reading DIP switch table and matching switch positions to corresponding time values.\n\nCommon settings: 0 sec, 60 sec, 100 sec, 180 sec (varies by manufacturer and model).",

          "content": "Proper testing and troubleshooting procedures are essential for diagnosing and repairing control system problems efficiently and safely.\n\nTroubleshooting Procedure Steps:\n\nFirst step in troubleshooting: Know the system (not make trial run, not test conclusions, not replace components).\n\nMust understand:\n- Normal operation sequence\n- Component functions\n- Safety interlocks\n- Timing sequences\n\nThen proceed with:\n2. Make observations\n3. Conduct trial run\n4. Test and measure\n5. Draw conclusions\n6. Make repairs\n\nExample Diagnostics:\n\nFan motor not running, burner operating, heat exchanger above fan-on setpoint, fan switch contacts open:\nAction: Replace fan switch (switch should close at setpoint, if open above setpoint = faulty switch).\n\nFurnace not lighting, thermostat calling for heat, 24V across thermostat connections:\nAction: Replace thermostat (if reading 24V across closed thermostat, thermostat contacts not making connection - faulty thermostat).\n\nDirect-Spark Ignition (DSI) Testing:\n\nGround wire requirements:\n- Thermoplastic insulated wire rated for 105°C (221°F) minimum\n- Female 1/4-in (6mm) quick-connect on one end\n- Connect to GND terminal on control module\n- Strip and scrape other end to remove coating\n- Fasten under igniter mounting screw\n- Shield wire from radiant heat where necessary\n- Burner serves as common grounding area\n\nGrounding verification:\n- Good metal-to-metal contact required\n- If no good contact: Run lead from burner to ground\n- If flame sensor on separate bracket: Ensure good contact with main burner\n- If no good contact: Run lead wire from sensor to same ground as spark igniter\n\nFlame Sensing Circuit Check:\n\nControl module provides AC power to igniter-sensor. Pilot burner flame rectifies to DC.\n\nMinimum flame signal required: 1.5 µA DC (not 0.5 µA, not 2.5 µA, not 5 µA)\n\nIf below 1.5 µA or unsteady: System will lock out\n\nMultimeter Setting:\n\nWhen testing flame sensing circuit: µA DC (microamp DC scale, not µV AC, not µA AC, not µV DC)\n\nTesting procedure:\n1. Connect meter in series with flame signal ground wire\n2. Disconnect ground wire at control module\n3. Connect red (positive) lead to free end of ground wire\n4. Connect black (negative) lead to quick-connect ground terminal on control module\n5. Restart system and read meter\n6. Must be at least 1.5 µA and steady\n\nIf reading below 1.5 µA or unsteady:\n- Check pilot flame\n- Check electrical connections\n- Check for cracked ceramic insulator\n- Replace igniter-sensor if necessary\n\nHot Surface Ignition (HSI) Testing:\n\nHoneywell S89 and S890 control modules commonly used.\n\nPreliminary Checks:\n\nBefore troubleshooting:\n1. Check disconnect switch and fuse\n2. Check manual shut-off valve is open\n3. Ensure wiring connections clean and tight\n4. Check if module in safety lockout\n\nSystem Troubleshooting:\n\n1. Start system by setting temperature controller above room temperature\n2. Observe system response\n3. Establish type of malfunction using manufacturer sequence or troubleshooting chart\n4. Continue checking until solution clear\n\nSafety Lockout:\n\nS89 and S890 provide 100% shut-off on:\n- Ignition failure\n- Loss of established flame\n\nModule operation phases:\n1. Pre-purge (S890 only)\n2. Igniter warmup\n3. Trial-for-ignition\n4. Burner operation\n\nOne Trial-for-Ignition Modules (C, D, J models):\n\nNo flame by end of timed trial:\n- Gas control closes\n- Module locks out\n- Manual reset required (remove power or set thermostat below room temperature for at least 45s)\n\nBurner lights but goes out during run cycle:\n- Gas control closes\n- Module initiates warmup followed by one trial-for-ignition\n- S890: 30s pre-purge then one trial\n- If flame not established: Locks out, requires manual reset\n\nThree Trial-for-Ignition Modules (G, H models):\n\nNo flame by end of first trial:\n- Gas control closes\n- Module initiates second 30s minimum purge (S890 only)\n- Followed by igniter warmup and second trial\n\nFlame not established on second trial:\n- Purge, warmup, and trial repeated third time\n\nStill no flame after third trial:\n- Gas control closes\n- Module locks out\n- Manual reset required\n\nBurner goes out during run cycle:\n- Gas control closes\n- Module checks number of trials performed during current call\n- If less than three: Initiates purge, warmup, and trial\n- After third trial during single call: Locks out, requires manual reset\n\nIgnition System Checks:\n\nEnsure:\n- Ignition wire does not touch any metal surface\n- Connections to module and igniter-sensor clean and tight\n- Ignition wire provides good electrical continuity\n\nGrounding Checks:\n\nNuisance shutdowns often caused by poor or erratic ground.\n\nCommon ground required for:\n- Module\n- Igniter\n- Flame sensor\n- Main burner\n\n24V (GND) terminal internally grounds one side of transformer. Auxiliary controls or limits must NOT be in grounded leg. Appliance should be earth-grounded.\n\nChecks:\n1. Metal-to-metal contact between igniter bracket and main burner\n2. Ground lead from GND (burner) terminal to igniter bracket\n3. If wire damaged: Replace with No. 14 or 18-gauge, moisture-resistant, thermoplastic insulated wire, 105°C minimum rating\n4. Use shield if necessary to protect from radiant heat\n5. Check temperature at igniter ceramic or flame sensor insulator\n6. Excessive temperature permits leakage to ground\n7. Provide shields if temperature exceeds igniter/sensor rating\n8. Replace igniter-sensor if insulator cracked\n\nFlame Sensor Circuit Checks:\n\n1. Check L1 (hot) and L2 (neutral) wired to proper terminals (if interchanged: S89/S890 won't detect flame, goes into safety shutdown)\n\n2. Ensure burner flame provides good rectification signal\n\nSensor positioning for good rectifying flame:\n- 3/4 to 1 inch (19 to 25mm) of flame sensor continuously immersed in flame\n- 1/4 to 1/2 inch (6 to 13mm) proper positioning from burner\n- Bend bracket or relocate sensor as necessary\n- Do NOT relocate igniter or combination igniter-sensor\n\n3. Check for excessive temperature at ceramic flame rod insulator\n- Excessive = over 500°F (260°C)\n- Can cause short to ground\n- Move sensor to cooler location or shield insulator\n- Do NOT relocate igniter or combination igniter-sensor\n\n4. Check for cracked ceramic insulator (causes short to ground, replace unit)\n\n5. Ensure electrical connections clean and tight\n\n6. Replace damaged wire with moisture-resistant No. 18 wire rated for 105°C continuous duty\n\n7. Visually check igniter doesn't develop insulating layer on surface over time (prevents flame sensing)\n\nApproved Igniters:\n\nHoneywell approved only Norton 201 and 271 because they meet specifications:\n- Reach 1000°C (1832°F) within 36s with 102V AC applied\n- Maintain at least 500 MΩ insulation resistance between igniter lead wires and mounting bracket\n- Current draw at 132V AC does not exceed 5A\n\nIntegrated Control Module (IFC) Testing:\n\nMicroprocessor control continually monitors appliance operation. When error occurs: Communicates fault analysis via fault LEDs or code displayed on user interface.\n\nFault Code Retrieval:\n\nNot all IFC have fault code retrieval push button on module (FALSE - some use only LEDs, some have buttons).\n\nFault indication methods:\n- Single LED with multiple flashes\n- Multiple LEDs\n- User interface display\n- Combination of LED flashes and screen displays\n\nSimple systems: Fault list shown right on module\n\nComplex systems: LED flash code tables or multiple LED/screen display combinations\n\nLED Flash Codes:\n\nCan show:\n- Normal status indicators (LED color changes)\n- Fault conditions (specific flash patterns)\n- Example: Variable-speed fully modulating furnaces use LED flashes AND user interface display\n\nMultiple LED Systems:\n\nMore complex appliances may have:\n- Multiple LEDs showing different system aspects\n- Multiple screen displays\n- Comprehensive fault tables with cross-referencing\n\nComponent Recalibration and Replacement:\n\nMost controls factory-set or set upon installation per manufacturer instructions.\n\nNever disturb settings unless definitely determined malfunction due to improper setting.\n\nThermostats: Example of control that CAN be recalibrated or readjusted (TRUE).\n\nOther examples: Heat anticipators, oven thermostats, improperly operating gas valves, spark ignition electrode gaps, some pilots, some solid-state elements.\n\nMost electronic controls: Cannot be field calibrated, must be returned to manufacturer or replaced.\n\nReplacement Decisions:\n\nField repair often not practical. Often cheaper and safer to replace than repair.\n\nMost electronic controls: Not repairable, must be replaced.\n\nIf module needs replacement:\n- Ensure manufacturer-approved matching component\n- Compare to existing unit to ensure connections match\n- Label all wires before disconnecting\n- Take picture for reference\n- Check DIP switch settings on new module to match old one\n\nReplacement Options:\n\nLike-for-like: Simplest but component may be outdated, difficult to locate\n\nUniversal component: Can keep supply in van, become familiar with installation/operation, increase efficiency\n\nUpgrade control system: More expensive initially but saves money long-run, benefits from current safety standards and technology\n\nCSA B149.1 Requirements:\n\nClause 4.3.4 covers field acceptance of:\n- Ignition systems (e.g., standing pilot to automatic ignition)\n- Automatic safety shut-off valves\n- Pilot-operated safety shut-off valves\n- Miscellaneous requirements\n\nSelection based on:\n- Purpose of operation\n- Sequence of operations\n- Mechanical characteristics\n- Electrical characteristics (switching actions, amperage ratings)\n- Differential settings\n- Physical dimensions (mounting, size)\n- Resets (manual or automatic)\n- Availability\n\nAlways consult manufacturer for approved replacement to ensure proper and safe operation.",

The microprocessor \nuses the algorithm to perform \ncalculations with converted \ndigital data received from system \nsensors.\nAnalogue signal\nHas an arrangement of values, \nwhich could be measuring \ntemperature, pressure, humidity, \nflow, light levels, etc., over any \ngiven time period.\nDigital signal\nOne of two values they are also called binary, as their information consists \nof nothing but zeroes and ones. Examples include open/closed, \nstart/stop, on/off, yes/no.\nMore Control System \nTerminology\nBuilding management \nsystem (BMS/BAS/EMS)\nThe main building HVAC and \nenergy control system designed \nto maximize energy \nperformance as well as provide \nan optimal environment to the \noccupants in the area. The BMS \nuses a main network to connect \nto multiple areas or system \ncontrollers.\nDirect digital control \n(DDC)\nA term used in building \nautomation for the concept of \nreading sensor data, processing \nthe data in the digital domain, \nand controlling heating, \nventilation, and air conditioning \n(HVAC) equipment. A DDC \ncontroller converts analogue \nsignals to digital and back as \nneeded.\nDual in-line package switch (DIP switch)\nA manual electric switch that is packaged with others in a group.\nFlame Control Terminology\n1\nFlame failure response time\nThe time it takes for the flame sensor circuits to react to a flame failure \nand de-energize the main gas valve.\n2\nFlame safeguard control (FSG)\nThe central controller over the safe supply of gas and air to the \nburner(s).\n3\nTrial for ignition\nThe period of time allowed to establish ignition. For modules that are \npart of a 100% safe system, the trial for ignition period is stated on the \nmodule.\n4\nLockout\nThe expiration of the ignition time with a control module, which then \nrequires a manual reset to restart the ignition sequence.\nNetwork and Communication \nTerminology\nInput/Output (I/O)\nCommonly used to refer to the different signals or control points connected to the \ncontroller. The reference to I/O lets an installer know there are field connections \nrequired.\nLocal area network (LAN)\nA network that interconnects computers within a limited area such as a residence, \nschool, laboratory, university campus, and office building.\nLocal operating network (LON)\nA networking platform specifically created to address the needs of control \napplications, built on a protocol for networking devices over media.\nNetwork protocols\nA set of rules and conventions for communication between network devices. \nStandardized network protocols provide a common language for network devices.\nWireless Communication Terminology\nWireless communication\nThe transfer of information or power \nbetween two or more points using \nradio waves.\nWireless local area network \n(WLAN)\nA computer network that links two or \nmore devices over a short distance \nusing a wireless distribution method.\nWireless personal area \nnetwork (WPAN)\nA PAN carried over a low-powered, \nshort distance wireless network \ntechnology.\nWide-area network (WAN)\nAny telecommunications network or \ncomputer network that extends over \na large geographical distance.\nControl Concepts: Thermal Expansion of Solids\nPrinciples of Thermal Expansion\nControl systems used in the gas industry use the physical characteristics of solids, liquids, and \ngases to expand and contract and to conduct or resist electricity as a means of regulating the \nburner system. For example, physical characteristics associated with the expansion of solids and \nliquids, electromagnetism, the thermoelectric effect, and electricity are all used in varying \ncapacities.\nMetals expand when heated and contract when cooled. The principle of the thermal expansion of \nsolids is used for several control devices that regulate temperature change.\nTemperature Disc\nThe temperature snap disc (Klixon®) responds to temperature changes by moving from a \nconcave to convex shape, touching electrical contacts and completing a circuit. The temperature \ndisc can be used in the thermal relay.\nBimetallic Strip Operation\nHow Bimetallic Strips Work\nThe bimetallic strip operates on the fact \nthat not all metals expand at the same \nrate. This device uses the warping \naction created when two dissimilar \nmetals having different coefficients of \nexpansion are welded together at one \nend and exposed to temperature \nchange.\nMovement Mechanism\nSince one end of the bimetallic strip is \nanchored solidly, the free end moves up \nor down with an increase or decrease in \ntemperature. The resulting curling or \nbending is used to control the opening \nor closing of electrical contacts.\nApplications\nThe functions of the bimetallic strip can \nbe tied in with a change in voltage by \nwrapping a heat resistive wire around \nthe strip. When voltage is applied, the \ncurrent drawn by the wire will create \nheat, causing the bimetal to warp and \nopen/close electrical contacts.\nRod and Tube Control Device\nConstruction\nThe rod and tube control device works on \nthe principle that some metals expand \nmore quickly than others. The sensing \nportion is constructed of copper tube that \nhas a high expansion/contraction rate.\nComponents\nThe copper tube encases an invar rod, a \nmetal alloy with a low \nexpansion/contraction rate. The invar rod \nand copper tube are welded together at the \nfar end.\nOperation\nThe expansion and contraction of the \ncopper tube effectively moves the invar rod \nback and forth, opening and closing a \nswitch.\nThermal Expansion of Liquids\nLiquid Expansion Principle\nLike solids, liquids expand when \nheated and contract when cooled. \nWhen liquid is sealed in a narrow \ntube (called a capillary), the force \ncreated by the liquid expanding \nwithin the capillary is used to \noperate an electrical switch or \ncontrol mechanism.\nSealed Bellows\nIn the sealed bellows control device, \nliquid inside a bulb at one end of the \ncapillary tube senses the \ntemperature of the surrounding \natmosphere and expands or \ncontracts. At the other end of the \ncapillary tube an attached bellows \nreacts to the pressure within the \ncapillary by expanding or \ncontracting.\nApplications\nThe action of the bellows is used to \noperate a switching device \ncompleting or interrupting an \nelectrical circuit, or a mechanism \nthat controls the gas valve outlet \nmodulating the gas supply to the \nmain burner.\nLiquid Fill Types for Sealed Bellows\nFluid Fill\nSealed bellows used to operate thermostats may have a \ntemperature limit of 650°F (343°C) and usually contain a \nfluid similar to a light oil. The expansion or contraction of \nthis type of fill is quite linear and gives a smooth operation of \nthe thermostat.\nAlways check the manufacturer's specification for \nrecommended temperature and pressure limits.\nMercury\nFor high temperatures, such as 3000°F (1648°C) reached in \npilot safety controls, the bulb must be filled with mercury. \nThe expansion of the mercury is smooth up to \napproximately 650°F (343°C), at which point the mercury \nvaporizes (boils).\nWith vapourization, a rapid expansion takes place, giving \nthe control \"snap action\". Similarly, upon cooling, there is a \nrapid contraction as the vapour condenses to a liquid.\nElectro-magnetism in Controls\nElectromagnetic Principle\nWhen an electrical current is passed through a metal rod (conductor), a magnetic field surrounds \nthe conductor.\nSolenoid Creation\nThis principle has been used in creating the electromagnet, which forms the basis for the \nsolenoid used in many control devices.\nSolenoid Operation\nWhen current runs through the solenoid coil, it creates a magnetic force that \npulls the armature into the center of the coil.\nReturn Mechanism\nWhen the circuit is opened, the magnetic field dies, and the armature \nreturns to its original position, often with the assistance of a spring.\nThermoelectric Effect\nThermoelectric Principle\nThe thermoelectric effect of producing electricity by heat is used for the thermocouple and thermopile.\nThermocouple Construction\nA thermocouple consists of a bimetallic strip joined at one end (called the hot junction).\nVoltage Generation\nWhen the hot junction is heated, a direct current (DC) voltage is \ngenerated across to the other two ends of the strips (the cold \njunction).\nThe thermocouple is used to prove the pilot flame. If it goes out, the thermocouple prevents the main gas valve from opening. The \nmagnitude of the voltage across to the cold junction depends on the two materials of the bimetallic strip and the temperature difference \nbetween the hot and cold junctions.\nThermocouple Output and \nApplications\nThermocouple \nOutput\nThe output of a single \nthermocouple is very small \n- 20 to 30 millivolts (mV) \n[1000 mV ",

This comprehensive guide covers essential terminology, diagrams, components, and operational sequences that every gas technician must understand.\nEssential Terminology\nElectrical Symbols\nRepresent the switches and loads of a circuit in standardized visual format\nLadder Diagram\nSame as schematic diagram - shows electrical flow in ladder-like format\nPhasing\nMatching the polarity of primary and secondary sides of a transformer\nPolarity\nDirection of current flow in DC circuits and differentiation between hot, neutral, and ground in AC circuits\nThe Foundation: Schematic Diagrams\nThe schematic diagram is the basic means of communicating the language of control. This essential tool consists of symbols interconnected by lines to indicate current flow through various devices.\nSchematic diagrams reveal two critical elements:\nThe power source\nHow current flows through contacts, coils, and overloads\nThese diagrams focus purely on electrical operation without showing physical relationships between components.\nUnderstanding Ladder Diagrams\nLeft-Hand Side\nRepresents the incoming voltage - the power source for the entire system\nRight-Hand Side\nRepresents the outgoing current - each parallel load has a separate connection/rung\nLadder Rungs\nWires and devices connecting the two sides form the \"rungs\" representing separate circuits and components\nWiring Diagrams: The Circuit Map\nWiring diagrams are maps of electrical circuits that show exactly how and where wires connect between devices. They're invaluable for initial wiring and troubleshooting, displaying the actual location of all circuit components using standard electrical symbols.\nKey Feature: All wires run horizontally or vertically. When wires cross, a dot indicates connection - no dot means wires cross but don't connect electrically.\nComparing Wiring vs. Schematic Diagrams\nWiring Diagram\nShows physical connections and component locations for installation and troubleshooting\nSchematic Diagram\nShows electrical operation and current flow - much easier to follow the circuit logic\nCircuit Types: Series and Parallel\nSeries Circuits\nComponents connected so electric current must pass through each one in sequence. Current has only one path to follow.\nParallel Circuits\nMore than one path is available for current flow. Components can operate independently of each other.\nSeries/Parallel Circuits\nComplete electrical circuits may have some parts wired in series and others wired in parallel for optimal functionality.\nInternational Electrical Symbols\nWiring and schematic diagrams use standardized symbols instead of pictures to represent switches and loads. These international symbols ensure universal understanding across the gas industry.\nKey symbol categories include switches (disconnect, circuit breaker, limit, temperature, pressure), contacts, transformers, fuses, and wiring connections.\nSwitch Fundamentals\nNormally Open (NO) Switches\nResting position is open. Typically used for actuating switches.\nSymbol above line: closes on decrease in activating medium\nSymbol below line: closes on increase in activating medium\nNormally Closed (NC) Switches\nResting position is closed. Typically used for limit switches and safety controls.\nMultiple Terminal Switches\nSingle Pole Double Throw (SPDT) switches can be wired as either NO or NC depending on the application. These versatile switches have three terminals but typically use only two.\nThree terminal configuration showing common, NO, and NC connections\nWiring examples for both NO and NC configurations using common terminal\nRelay Operation Principles\nA relay is an automatically operated switch. In electric control systems, relays operate via electromagnet or solenoid, with electrical contacts opening/closing when the coil is energized or de-energized.\nCommon application: 24V coil controls 120V circuit, allowing safer low-voltage control wiring while switching higher voltage loads.\nRelay Voltage Configurations\nThis diagram illustrates two different relay configurations:\nCR1: 24V coil located in low-voltage circuit, contacts in 120V line voltage circuit\nCR2: Both coil and contacts operate in line voltage circuits\nThis flexibility allows optimal safety and control design for various applications.\nRelay Specifications and Ratings\nRelay terminals are labeled to match the schematic stamped on the exterior. Contact ratings show maximum voltage/current the switch can repeatedly connect and interrupt without overheating or arcing.\nExample NO contact ratings for 120V AC:\n1 horsepower (HP)\n16 Amps full load (AFL)\n96 Amps lock rotor (ALR)\n16 Ohms contact resistance\nTime-Delay Relays (Timers)\nTime-delay relays control equipment operation according to predetermined time intervals. They prevent simultaneous motor starting that could cause excessive current draw and blown fuses.\nCommon designations in ladder diagrams:\n\"TD\" - Time Delay\n\"TDR\" - Time Delay Relay\n\"TR\" - Timer Relay\nArrows on contact symbols indicate time delay function.\nModern Control Integration\nMost new equipment manufactured today includes integrated control boards that incorporate all necessary time-delay functions for equipment operation.\nWhen coordinating multiple equipment starting and stopping, building automation strategies are implemented for optimal system performance.\nHeavy-Duty Contactors\nHeavy-duty contactors are solenoid/armature operators designed for switching high-current, high-voltage industrial equipment.

For modules that are part of a 100% safe system, the trial for ignition period is stated on the module.\nWide-area network\nWAN\nAny telecommunications network or computer network that extends over a large geographical distance. The internet could be considered the ultimate WAN as it is a global system of interconnected computer networks.\nModern thermostats incorporate advanced temperature sensing and control capabilities for precise environmental management.\nWireless Communication Technologies\nBluetooth (2–10 meters)\nShort-range wireless communication for personal devices\nZigbee (10–20 meters)\nLow-power mesh networking for home automation\nWi-Fi (30–100 meters)\nHigh-speed wireless networking for internet connectivity\nControl Concepts and Components\nControl systems used in the gas industry use the physical characteristics of solids, liquids, and gases to expand and contract and to conduct or resist electricity as a means of regulating the burner system. For example, physical characteristics associated with the expansion of solids and liquids, electromagnetism, the thermoelectric effect, and electricity are all used in varying capacities.\nEach of the founding principles is discussed below, with examples of controls that operate on these principles.\nThermal Expansion\nUtilizes the expansion and contraction of materials with temperature changes\nElectromagnetism\nEmploys magnetic fields created by electrical current for mechanical action\nThermoelectric Effect\nConverts temperature differences directly into electrical voltage\nElectrical Resistance\nUses changes in electrical resistance to control system operation\nThermal Expansion of Solids\nMetals expand when heated and contract when cooled. The principle of the thermal expansion of solids is used for several control devices that regulate temperature change.\nTemperature Disc\nThe temperature snap disc (Klixon®) shown in Figure 1-1 responds to temperature changes by moving from a concave to convex shape, touching electrical contacts and completing a circuit. The temperature disc can be used in the thermal relay.\nFigure 1-1 Temperature disc used in thermal relay\nBimetallic Strip\nThe bimetallic strip operates on the fact that not all metals expand at the same rate. This device uses the warping action created when two dissimilar metals having different coefficients of expansion are welded together at one end and exposed to temperature change.\nFigure 1-2 Bimetallic strip warps and bends with an increase in temperature\nElectrical Heating of a Resistive Element\nMost materials conduct electrical current to some degree and heat up as a result. The amount of heat created depends on the material's electrical resistance and the amount of current flow through the material.\nThe functions of the bimetallic strip can be tied in with a change in voltage by wrapping a heat resistive wire around the strip. When voltage is applied, the current drawn by the wire will create heat, causing the bimetal to warp and open/close electrical contacts.\nRod and Tube\nThe rod and tube control device also works on the principle that some metals expand more quickly than others. In this control device, the sensing portion of the valve is constructed of copper tube that has a high expansion/contraction rate. The copper tube encases an invar rod, a metal alloy with a low expansion/contraction rate.\nThermal Expansion of Liquids\nLike solids, liquids expand when heated and contract when cooled. When liquid is sealed in a narrow tube (called a capillary), the force created by the liquid expanding within the capillary is used to operate an electrical switch or control mechanism.\nSealed Bellows\nIn the sealed bellows control device, liquid inside a bulb at one end of the capillary tube senses the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere and expands or contracts. At the other end of the capillary tube an attached bellows reacts to the pressure within the capillary by expanding or contracting.\nThe action of the bellows is used to operate:\na switching device -- completing or interrupting an electrical circuit\na mechanism that controls the gas valve outlet modulating the gas supply to the main burner\nThe liquid in the bulb may be fluid fill or mercury, depending on the temperatures that will be encountered.\nFluid Fill\nSealed bellows used to operate thermostats may have a temperature limit of 650 °F (343 °C) and usually contain a fluid similar to a light oil. The expansion or contraction of this type of fill is quite linear and gives a smooth operation of the thermostat.\nAlways check the manufacturer's specification for recommended temperature and pressure limits.\nMercury\nFor high temperatures, such as 3000 °F (1648 °C) reached in pilot safety controls, the bulb must be filled with mercury. The expansion of the mercury is smooth up to approximately 650 °F (34",

Pressure transmitters or transducers convert an applied \npressure into a measurable electrical signal. A pressure transmitter consists of two parts: \n• an elastic material, which deforms when exposed to a pressurized medium; and \n• an electrical device, which detects the deformation (Figure 1-32). \nOne of the most common methods is to form the elastic material into a thin flexible diagram. The \nelectrical device then detects this deformation and converts it into a proportional electrical signal. \nSeptember 2020 \nFigure 1-32 \nElectronic pressure sensor \n39\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 13 \nSystem control concepts \nThe two primary control concepts are either: \n• on/off control used with electromechanical controllers; or \nControls: Fundamentals \n• closed-loop control used with sensors and a microprocessor-based controller. \nI \nco \ntns \nWhen electromechanical devices measure the controlled variables (air temperature, water \ntemperature, etc.), they directly act upon a set of electrical contacts. For this reason, they were \ncalled controllers as they would be installed directly into an electrical circuit that would be \nenergizing or de-energizing a load or relay. Therefore, the control sequencing and logic is built \ninto the circuitry. This type of control concept is often referred to as ON/OFF control. On/off is a \nvery simple form of control, but its outcome will have swings over and under the desired setpoint \n(deadband) (Figure 1-33). This is due to a number of reasons such as the equipment is only \nrunning at either 100% on or off, and the electromechanical controller itself has to have a \ndifferential designed into it or the contacts would be rapid firing constantly. \nFigure 1-33 \nBasic on/off control deadband \n~ \n::J \n.... \n~ \na, \nC. \nE \n~ \nON \nOFF \nON \n.------, \n(JO \n100%~ \nOutput c,o o'o \n0% \n..... _ \n____, \ncont \nTime \nOFF \nON \nOFF \n~ (JO \nON \nOFF \nThe electronic devices introduced in this chapter are mostly sensors that would be measuring the \ncontrolled variable and communicating that information to a master controller. Example of these \ncontrollers are integrated furnace controls and integrated boiler controls. They are referred to as \n\"integrated\" because they can combine two or more functions to become more effective. For \nexample, modulating boilers and multistage furnaces can vary their firing rate based on feedback \nthat the controller gets from its various internal and remote sensors. \nBasically, an electronic control system, no matter how complex, consists of the following: \n• sensors; \n• controller; and \n• control devices. \n40 \nSeptember 2020\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 13 \nControls: Fundamentals \nA closed-loop control system (Figure 1-34) can make adjustments to the manipulated variable ( e. \ng., boiler supply water temperature) based on feedback it receives from sensors in the controlled \nvariable \n(e.g., indoor air). This enables a heating system to modulate its input and more closely match the \nload requirement to avoid the overshoot and undershoot inherent with an on/off control system. \nPID control \nFigure 1-34 \nClosed-loop control systems \nWeather \nconditions \nUser settings \n(e.g., temperature -\npressure flow rate \nswitch status) \nWeather \nconditions \n1.

Sensor measures \ncontrolled variable \n(e.g., measuring indoor \nair temperature) \nFeedback \nWhen the controller receives feedback from the sensors, it compares the information with the \nsetpoint value and makes adjustments. For example, the boiler may modulate its firing rate to \nbetter match the demand. The adjustments that the controller makes are based on a stored set of \ninstructions (algorithm). One of the most common control processing algorithms used is called \nproportional-integral-derivative control (PIO). The algorithm continually examines the difference \nbetween the target value of the controlled variable and the measure value. This difference is \nreferred to as error. \nSeptember 2020 \n41\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 13 \nControls: Fundamentals \nThe PIO logic uses three distinct mathematical concepts to adjust its output signal: \n• Proportional response is when the output varies in proportion to how much error exists (e.g., \nhow far is the boiler water temperature from the setpoint). \n• Integral response examines the duration over which the error occurs (e.g., how long has the \ntemperature been below the setpoint). \n• Derivative response measures how fast the error is changing. This adjusts the reaction time. \nOutdoor reset \nIn the examples above, the boiler firing rate is being modulated for more accurate control. Water \ntemperature can also be adjusted to change the output of the heat emitters. Outdoor reset is \nwhen the controller calculates the system water temperature setpoint by monitoring weather \nconditions, as shown in the first two blocks of Figure 1-35. The controller lowers boiler water \ntemperature when the outdoor temperature is warmer and increases it when the outdoor \ntemperature is colder. This feature is included in the controller for most modern condensing \nboilers and, in many areas, is a regulated energy conservation requirement. \nBuilding management systems \nToday, many gas appliances have an integrate control located right on the equipment. These may \ninclude sensor (1/0) connections, as well as internal PIO modules within the control board. On \nlarger commercial, institutional, and industrial systems, the control loop for the gas equipment is \nonly one piece of the puzzle, and it needs to be able to work in harmony with other HVAC \nequipment. On these systems, it is common to use a DOC or PLC system to communicate, \noperate, and coordinate the various HVAC equipment. The building will likely have other control \nloops operating lighting, security, or other mechanical systems. When all the systems are tied into \nthe building's main network (Primary Bus), this is referred to as a building management system \n(BMS), building automation system (BAS), or energy management systems (EMS) (Figure 1-35). \nThis type of system gives operators and managers the ability to monitor and control remotely \nfrom any networked location. Connecting all the systems to one BMS can improve occupant \ncomfort, system efficiency, energy consumption, and life cycle of equipment. The communication \nprotocols used by various equipment controllers may be proprietary or open protocol language. \nSome examples of protocols used for Local Area Networks (LAN) include Ethernet, Building \nAutomation and Control Network (BACnet), local operating network (LonWorks), Modbus, and \nKNX. \n42 \nSeptember 2020\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 13 \nControls: Fundamentals \nHuman interface device \ncomputer workstation \nFigure 1-35 \nBMS/BAS/EMS \nWeb \nserver \nPrimary _ __. ____ ...,... ______________ \n..,....._._ __ \n_ \nbus \nCentra l plant \ncontroller \nProgrammable \nlogic controller \nProgrammable \nlogic controller \nSecondary bus \nBoiler \nPackage unit \nLighting \nBACnet \nLanTalk \ncontroller \ncontroller \ncontroller \ndevice \ndevice \nVAV box \nVAV box \nVAV box \nVAV box \nBuilding management systems may use the DOC or PLC to control the equipment firing rate and \nthe outdoor reset functions. In these cases, it may be necessary to override these functions \nwithin the appliance's internal controller, which could entail specific settings on the appliance DIP \nswitches and 1/0 connections as well as a network protocol interface module. \nBe sure to follow the manufactures instructions for setting up the appliance onto a BMS. \nLimit and safety controllers \nLimit and safety controls include all the interlocking controls to ensure that the burner cannot \noperate unless all associated functions to the burner are normal. Thus, in addition to the standard \npressure and temperature safety limit controls used for the protection of the fired equipment, \nthere are several other controls used as limits or interlocks. \nLow-water cut-off switch \nThe low-water cut-off switch actuates in response to fluid movement. If the water level in the \nboiler falls below the minimum level, the low-water cut-off switch opens its contacts and cuts off \npower to the main gas valve. The Boiler and Pressure Vessel code lists when and where low \nwater cut-offs are required. \nThere are two basic types of low-water cut-off switches: \n• float type; and \n• probe type. \nSeptember 2020 \n43\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 13 \nControls: Fundamentals \nThe float type (Figure 1-36) is a normally open switch that is held close by the float on top of the \nwater.

It has an electronic circuitry that uses \nboiler water to conduct current between the terminals on the end of the probes. There are \nmultiple and single probe types. The single probe type is most common in commercial and \nresidential applications. On the single probe type, if the water falls below the level of the probe, \nthe electronic circuit between the terminal and the boiler shell or piping is broken.

The appliance regulator portion of the valve can be identified by the familiar \nshape of the spring housing and adjustment screw cover. \nSeptember 2020 \n91\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 13 \nControls: Fundamentals \nFigure 1-89 \nCombination valve - identified appliance regulator portion \nCourtesy of Camosun College, Rodney Lidstone, licenced under CC BY \nAutornatic gas valves \nThe automatic gas valve starts and stops the flow of gas to the appliance main burners. A \nsensing device activates the automatic gas valve, allowing the gas to flow to the burners where \nignition will take place. There are many types of automatic gas valves with various sensing \ndevices and activation methods. \nThe methods of operation include: \n• Mechanically (non-electric) operated by a mechanical sensing device such as a capillary or \nrod and tube acting directly as the valve operator; and \n• Electromagnetic solenoid-operated where the control circuit is energized or de-energized to \nactivate the valve. An electromechanical switch that contains a sensing device such as \nthermostat, aquastat, or pressuretrol can activate the control circuit. Alternately, an electronic \ncontrol module that is monitoring the sensing device(s) could energize the control circuit, \nwhich is usually operated by 24 V AC, but may be by 120 V AC or millivoltage DC. \nNon-electric automatic gas valves \nNon-electric gas control valves rely upon a thermo-mechanical sensing element to act directly \nupon them. Two common types are: \n• rod and tube water heater gas valves; and \n• hydraulically operated gas valves. \n92 \nSeptember 2020\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 13 \nControls: Fundamentals \nRod and tube \nThe rod and tube combination gas valve (Figure 1-90) is a multi-purpose valve typically installed \nin storage type water heaters. They are sometimes referred to as a Unitrol as this was one of the \nfirst most popular models used. It contains in one compact unit: \n• an automatic safety shut-off valve; \n• a main and standby gas cock; \n• a thermostat; \n• an automatic main gas valve; \n• an over temperature energy cut-off (eco) device; and \n• a main pressure regulator. \nReset button \nFigure 1-90 \nUnitrol multi-purpose valve \nImage courtesy of Terry Bell \nRegulator adjustment cap \nGas cock dial \nTemperature \ndial \nThe Unitrol actuates in response to changes in water temperature. Its sensing device works on \nthe rod and tube principle. In Figure 1-91, the copper tubes have been cut away to expose the \ninvar rod, IJl(hich moves in and out of the valve body as the copper tube expands or contracts \nbased on the temperature of the water it is immersed in. Notice the cutaway on the left has extra \nwires within the copper tube. This is a built-in safety device called an Energy Cut-Off (ECO). The \nECO is a fusible link wired in series with the safety valve solenoid (Figure 1-91 ). If the \ntemperature-sensitive fuse exceeds 200°F, the fuse will melt, and the electrical current to the \nsafety valve power unit coil will be interrupted, shutting all of the gas off. Most ECOs are one-shot \ncontrols; if the ECO has tripped, the valve will have to be replaced. \nSeptember 2020 \n93\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 13 \nFigure 1-91 \nECO device \nPower unit coil \nControls: Fundamentals \nTemperature \nsensitive fuse \nMore recent hot water gas valves for higher efficiency type water heaters with ventor motors \nrequire 120 V power and are direct-ignition. \nModulating valve \nA modulating valve is a combination of two valves in a single unit designed to give precision \ntemperature control with minimum cycling and maximum operating efficiency. This valve operates \nin a sequence as follows: \n• A snap-acting valve opens at the initial call for heat to provide the minimum rate of gas flow. If \nthis gas flow is sufficient to bring the room up to the set temperature, the snap-acting valve \ncloses. \n• If more heat is required, a modulating valve adjusts the gas flow rate between the fixed \nminimum and full burner capacity. \n• The valve is provided with a minimum rate that is intended to match the minimum gas flow \nrequirement of the burner that it serves. \nThe temperature-sensing bulb, capillary tubing, and bellows are filled with a temperature-\nsensitive liquid. Changes in temperature at the bulb contract the liquid on temperature fall and \nexpand it on temperature rise, causing the bellows to shorten and lengthen respectively. This \nmovement is transmitted to the valve assembly by a horizontal pivot arm. \nThe modulating valve shown in Figure 1-92 are also used for oven controls and liquid \ntemperature controls. \n94 \nSeptember 2020\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 13 \nControls: Fundamentals \nFigure 1-92 \nModulating valve \nCourtesy of Camosun College, Rodney Lidstone, licenced under CC BY \nElectric automatic gas valves \nMost automatic gas valves are electrically actuated and are primarily found on the gas valve train \nto control gas flow to the burner. \nDiaphragm valve \nThe diaphragm gas valve is a pilot operated solenoid valve in that it uses available gas pressure \nas the primary force to open or close the valve (Figure 1-93). They are simply an on/off automatic \nvalve and do not regulate or modulate the flow. Although this style of diaphragm valve is rare \ntoday, it serves well as an introduction to an important concept used on most advanced valves. \nThis kind of valve operates as follows: \n1) \nOn a call for heat, the electromagnet is energized. \n2) \nThe electromagnet then pulls the armature into a position that blocks off the pressure port, \nallowing gas pressure above the diaphragm to bleed off through the vent port to a standing \npilot flame. \n3) \nThe gas pressure below the diaphragm lifts the diaphragm and valve disc from the valve \nseat. This action allows gas to flow through the valve. \n4) \nWhen the heat call has been satisfied, the electromagnet becomes de-energized, and the \narmature return spring pulls the armature into a position that blocks off the vent port. \n5) \nWorking gas enters the pressure port and pressurizes the top of the diaphragm. \n6) \nWhen the pressures above and below the diaphragm are equal, the spring will cause the \nvalve to close. \nNote that the diagram is not intended to scale as the pressure port is the size of a pin hole; \ntherefore, the armature and electromagnet can block gas flow with so much force. This enables \ndiaphragm valves to be operated with lower voltage such as millivolts. \nSeptember 2020 \n95\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 13 \nFigure 1-93 \nCutaway view of a diaphragm gas valve \nArmature \n(swivels to close \noff vent port) \nPressure \nport \nII \nArmature return \nring \nVent port \nDiaphragm \n-Gas flow -\nControls: Fundamentals \n--\n~ \nFigure 1-94 represents another more common version of the diaphragm gas valve.

Resting means that the \nmedium (heat, pressure, etc.) has not caused the switch to change positions. \n• Switches are normally open (NO) when the resting position of the switch is open [Figure 2-3 \n(a)]. Typically, actuating switches are in the NO position. \n118 \nSeptember 2020\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 13 \nControls: Fundamentals \nIf ... \nThen ... \nIf the NO switch symbol is shown \nThe switch will close on a decrease in the activating \nabove the line \nmedium (heat, pressure, etc.). \nIf the NO switch symbol is shown \nThe switch will close on an increase in the activating \nbelow the line \nmedium. \n• Switches are designated normally closed (NC) when the resting position of the switch is \nclosed [Figure 2-3(b)]. Typically, limit switches are in the NC position. \nFigure 2-3 \nNO and NC wiring of switches \n(a) Wird in normally \nopen position \nMultiple terminals \n(b) Wird in normally \nclosed position \nSwitches that are SPOT can be wired either as NO or NC, depending on the application.

A switch could be \noperated by compressed air, in which case it is a pneumatic relay. For electric control systems, \nthe relay can be operated by an electromagnet or solenoid [Figure 2-6(b)]. \n(a) R!lay \nFigure 2-6 \nSolenoid relay \nNormally open \ncontacts \n(b) Da:ail of the contacts \nIn a solenoid relay, the electrical contacts open and/or close when the contact relay's coil is \nenergized or de-energized in response to a change in the conditions of the electrical circuit. The \noperations of the contacts affect the operation of other devices in the same circuit or in other \ncircuits. \nIt is quite common for relays to be powered by 24 V, but they close a 120 V circuit. This way, the \ncontrol circuit can operate on safer lower voltage wiring. Relays however, are available in many \ncoil voltages to suit the particular application. It is, therefore, important to check the relay coil for \nproper voltage. \nTo illustrate, notice that in Figure 2-7 there are two contact relays one coil (CR1) is located on a \n24 V circuit while its contacts are located in a line (120) voltage circuit, thus the low voltage coil \ncontrols the higher voltage contact. Whereas CR2's coil and contact are both in line voltage \ncircuits. \n120 \nSeptember 2020\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 13 \nControls: Fundamentals \nFigure 2-7 \nTwo relays is powered by different voltages \nN \nCR2 \nHi h \nCRI \nCRI \nCR2 \nMed \nCRl \nG \nR \nw \nGas wive \nThe switch portion of the relay is identified the same way as a manual switch by the number of \npoles and throws with an additional solenoid symbol. The relay terminals would be labelled to \nmatch the schematic stamped onto the exterior of the relay (Figure 2-8). \nThe rating for the switch contacts are shown depending on the voltage they are switching. These \nrepresent the maximum voltage/current that the switch can repeatedly connect and interrupt \nwithout overheating or arcing. For example, the NO contacts when connected to a 120 V AC \ncircuit are rated for: \n• 1 horsepower (HP); \n• 16 Amps full load (AFL); \n• 96 Amps lock rotor (ALR); and \n• 16 Ohms (0) contact resistance (RES). \nThe solenoid coil rating is also shown as 24 V, 60 Hz 5 VA. \nSeptember 2020 \n121\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 13 \nFigure 2-8 \nRelay schematics \nA \nC \nSPST \nSPDT \nDPST \nDPDT \nTime-delay relay (timers) \nRATINGS \nVAC HP AFL-ALR RES \n120 \n1 \n16-96 \n16 \nNO 240 \n1 \n8-48 \n8 \n120 3/4 13.8-82.8 14 \nNC 240 3/4 8.9-41-4 \n7 \n~ \n~ \nCOIL 24V 60Hz SVA \nCOIL CKT.

If all these motors were to start simultaneously, the heavy current resulting from the \ntotal of all these starting currents might be large enough to blow a main fuse or circuit breaker. \nThe starting of such motors can be made to occur one after the other, instead of simultaneously, \nby putting a time-delay relay in control circuits of the sequenc",

An understanding of servicing and troubleshooting \nprocedures is essential in building these skills. \nTesting circuits may require working with live voltage. Remember to use extreme caution when \ndoing any live testing. CSA Z462 provides the minimum requirements that should be followed . \nOnly proceed with live testing if you are trained, authorized by your employer, and are using all \nrecommended personal protective equipment. \nThere are many different types of control modules in use and available from a wide variety of \nmanufacturers. Some control modules are specifically approved for use with the appliance and \nare not interchangeable with other makes and models of control modules, including ones \nadvertised as universal control modules. Gas technicians/fitters must ensure that the correct \ndevice is installed as approved by the manufacturer of the appliance. \nSeptember 2020 \n137\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 13 \nControls: Fundamentals \nObjectives \nAt the end of this chapter, you will be able to: \n• describe the servicing of controls and components; \n• describe troubleshooting procedures of control systems; \n• describe the testing and troubleshooting of ignition control modules; and \n• describe the recalibration and the replacing of components. \nTerminology \nTerm \nAbbreviation \nDefinition \n(Symbol) \nSequence of operation (in \nFlow chart to understand the overall operation \nmanufacturer's manual) \nof the appliance from top to bottom and assist \nin troubleshooting \nServicing controls and components \nIn the field of equipment servicing, many appliance malfunctions are due to dirt and debris \naccumulated from lack of maintenance. On service calls, before adjusting, repairing, or replacing \ncomponents, complete the following checks: \n1) \nClean electrical contacts with a clean, sturdy paper that is non-oily. Electrical contacts may \nbe corroded, resulting in failure to close a circuit properly. \n2) \nClean primary air vents that are dirty. Primary air openings may be blocked by lint or other \nmaterial. \n3) \nReplace dirty furnace filters. Dirty furnace filters may cause the furnace to cycle on the limit \ncontrol, giving the appearance of a short-cycling thermostat. \n4) \nBlow out or replace the pilot orifice. Failure of an ignition system may be due to a dirty or \npartially blocked orifice. \n5) \nClean burner orifices with a toothpick, never with a piece of wire. Low heat input may be due \nto a dirty or partially blocked orifice. \n6) \nClean the seat or pivot point in the valve. Dirt on the seat or pivot point in the valve may \ncause a valve to remain partially open. \n7) \nReadjust to nameplate. To adjust the appliance input rate: \n-\nChange the manifold pressure. \n-\nAdjust the gas regulator. \n-\nPut in new orifice spuds if greater change is required. \n8) \nFlush the water heater or boiler to remove sediment from the tank bottom. \n9) \nMake sure vents are clear and working properly. \n138 \nSeptember 2020\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 13 \nControls: Fundamentals \nUnderstanding the sequence of operation \nFigure 3-1 is a visual representation of the sequence of operation presented in manufacturer's \nmanuals.

This is normal \noperation for this gas ignition system. \nThis function occurs only with ST9160 connected to SmartValve\"' \nsystem control . \n139\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 13 \nControls: Fundamentals \nTroubleshooting control system problems \nTroubleshooting control systems requires special tools and instruments (electrical meters, flue \ngas analyzers, manometers, thermometers). The proper use of these tools and instruments is \ndirectly related to proper diagnosis; in addition, it minimizes the time necessary for repair or \nreplacement. \nTroubleshooting procedure \nIn any troubleshooting situation, it is necessary to consider the entire system -\nincluding not only \nthe burner, controls, wiring, etc., but also air supply, fuel supply, and the condition and \ncharacteristics of the flame itself. In order to cover all areas of burner operation, the \ntroubleshooting procedure is broken down into a series of specific steps. \nStep 1 -\nKno\\v the systen1 \nIn other words, \"Do your homework.\" Study the manufacturer's technical manuals. Know how the \nsystem works. \nKeep up with the latest service bulletins. Read them and then file them in a handy place. The \nproblem on your appliance may be addressed in one month's bulletin, giving the cause and \nremedy. \nStep 2 --- A.sk questions \nUsually, the information available on arrival at the installation consists of a simple statement such \nas \"The burner shuts down.\" Start by asking all the questions possible of anyone who might have \nsome knowledge of what happened. \nFor example: \n• When does the shutdown occur? \n• During what part of the cycle? \n• How long after the start-up? \n• Does a shutdown occur after every start? \n• How is the light-off? \nThese are only sample questions -\nthe information needed will depend on the individual \nsituation. \nStep 3 -\nEvaluate your inforrnation \nUse the supplied manufacturer's manuals, charts, service suggestions, together with your \npersonal experience, to evaluate any information you have concerning the problem. \nThe conclusions drawn at this stage only provide an idea of where to look for the exact solution to \nthe problem. \nOn modern appliances that use integrated controls, problems can be either operational \nparameters or faults. Operational parameters will be discussed in more detail within the study \nunits related to each specific type of gas appliance as there are many options depending \n140 \nSeptember 2020\nGAS TRADE TRAINING UNIT 13 \nControls: Fundamentals \napplication. Faults are typically shown by way of an LED status light on the control panel or a \ntouch screen user interface. Units with integrated controls typically can retrieve previous fault \ncodes. Be aware that some appliances recover and display the latest fault codes on power up. Be \nprepared to observe the codes and have the manufacturers' error code chart available for \ninterpretation. \nStep 4 -\nI\\!Iake a trial run \nCycle the burner system and observe using the following questions as a guide: \n• Was each step of the start-up according to the design sequence? \n• Did any deviations occur? \n• Did the shutdown occur exactly as described? \n• Did anything else happen? \n• Have any new facts been established? \nWhile you perform the trial run, make a note of any new information. \nStep 5 -\nRe-evaluate \nThe re-evaluation of available facts can often be made during the trial run. Look over your list of \npossible causes and decide which are most likely and which are easiest to verify. \nRemember that in some instances, more than one factor may be contributing to the problem and \nmust be considered in the solution. \nReach your decision on the leading causes and plan to check them first. \nStep 6 -\nTest your conclusions \nAfter determining the apparent cause(s) of appliance problem, perform a second test run to see if \nthe evaluation is correct. If you haven't found the answer, make a new evaluation that includes \nany new information that has been obtained during the second test run. \nMore than one re-evaluation test may be necessary to get all the information needed to positively \nidentify the cause(s) of the problem. \nStep 7 -\nCorrect the condition( s) \nAt this stage, you would be confident in adjusting or replacing the faulty part(s). \nNote that not all parts can be adjusted in the field -\ncheck with the manufacturer's manual. \nDo a final run through to check that the problem has been solved. \nTypical electrical checks and readings \nPerforming a thorough electrical check on the system allows you to pinpoint whether the fault is \nelectrical or mechanical. Mechanical failures include bent, damaged, or seized components such \nas shafts, rods, and operators. \nThe following procedures show how to conduct common electrical ",

When room thermostat calls for heat, the control module starts the \nsystem circulator and inducer.\nThe control module runs the inducer long enough to purge the boiler flue passages, then opens the pilot valve and activates \npilot ignition spark.\nThe control module allows up to 15 seconds to establish pilot flame. If flame is not sensed within 15 seconds, the control \nmodule will turn off the gas valve, flash the Flame light, and then enter a 15-second postpurge. The control module will then \nstart a new cycle. This will continue indefinitely until pilot flame is established or power is interrupted. Once pilot flame is \nproven, the control module opens the gas valve to allow main burner flame.\nWhen the room thermostat is satisfied, the control module turns off the gas valve, operates the inducer for a 15-second \npostpurge and waits for the next heat call.\nThe control module indicator lights show normal sequence when the lights are on steady. When a problem occurs, the control \nmodule flashes combinations of lights to indicate the most likely reason for the problem (see page 49).\n②\t\nTransformer\nThe control transformer reduces line voltage to 24 volts for the gas valve and limit circuit.\n③\t\nInducer\nThe inducer pulls flue gases through the boiler, causing air to be pulled in through the boiler air openings. The inducer pushes \nthe flue gases through the vent pipe as well.\n④\t\nAir pressure switch\nThe air pressure switch signals the control module, telling the control module whether the inducer is working correctly or \nthe vent is blocked.\n⑤\t\nWater temperature limit switch\nThe water temperature limit switch turns off the gas valve if the temperature in the boiler goes above its setting. (The circula-\ntor will continue to run as long as there is a call for heat.)\n⑥\t\nBoiler circulator\nThe boiler circulator circulates water through the external (system) piping. The circulator is shipped loose, and can be mounted \non either the boiler supply or return piping. The factory-installed circulator wiring harness provides ample length for either \nlocation. NOTE — The control module provides a pump exercising routine. If the boiler is not operated for 30 days, the \ncontrol module will power the circulator for 30 seconds, then turn off.\n⑦\t\nTimer relay\nThe timer relays delays high fire for 60 seconds.\na\t supply to system\nb\t return from system\nc\t stainless steel burners\nd\t flue outlet\ne\t gas valve\nf\t pressure/temperature gauge\ng\t relief valve\nh\t air vent connection\ni\t flame rollout thermal fuse element \n(TFE)\nj\t\nburner shield\nk\t pilot burner and bracket\nl\t\ngas manifold\nm\t cast iron boiler sections\nn\t flue collector\no\t junction box\nOther boiler components:\nPart Number 550-110-711/1108\n3\nGOLD CGi-4E Gas-Fired Water Boiler — Boiler Manual\nGOLD CGi-4E  Gas-Fired Induced-Draft Water Boiler\nGOLD CGi-4E Gas-Fired Water Boiler — Boiler Manual\n4\nPart Number 550-110-711/1108\nContents\n\t\nHow it works.....................................................2–3\n\t\nHazard definitions................................................ 4\n\t\nPlease read before proceeding............................. 5\n  1\t\nPrepare boiler location....................................6–11\n  2\t\nPrepare boiler...............................................12–13\n  3\t\nVenting..........................................................14-19\n  4\t\nWater piping..................................................20-29\n  5\t\nGas piping.......................................................... 30\n  6\t\nField wiring........................................................ 31\n  7\t\nStart-up.........................................................32-36\n  8\t\nCheck-out procedure — checklist...................... 37\n  9\t\nOperation......................................................38-42\n10\t\nService and maintenance..............................43-47\n11\t\nTroubleshooting............................................48-57\n12\t\nReplacement parts........................................58-65\n13\t\nDimensions and ratings.................................66-67\nHazard definitions\nThe following defined terms are used throughout this manual to bring attention to the presence of hazards of \nvarious risk levels or to important information concerning the life of the product.\n\t\nIndicates presence of hazards that will cause severe personal injury, death or substantial \nproperty damage.\n\t\nIndicates presence of hazards that can cause severe personal injury, death or substantial \nproperty damage.\n\t\nIndicates presence of hazards that will or can cause minor personal injury or property dam-\nage.\n\t\nIndicates special instructions on installation, operation or maintenance that are important but \nnot related to personal injury or property damage.\nPart Number 550-110-711/1108\n5\nGOLD CGi-4E Gas-Fired Water Boiler — Boiler Manual\nPlease read before proceeding\n\t\nFailure to adhere to the guidelines on this page can result in severe personal injury, death \nor substantial property damage.\n• \nContinual fresh makeup water will reduce \nboiler life. Mineral buildup in sections re-\nduces heat transfer, overheats cast iron, and \ncauses section failure. Addition of oxygen \nand other gases can cause internal corrosion. \nLeaks in boiler or piping must be repaired \nat once to prevent makeup water.\n• \nDo not add cold water to hot boiler. Thermal \nshock can cause sections to crack.\nGlycol — potential fire hazard —\nAll glycol is flammable when exposed to high \ntemperatures. If glycol is allowed to accumulate \nin or around the boiler or any other potential \nignition source, a fire can develop. In order to \nprevent potential severe personal injury, death \nor substantial property damage from fire and/or \nstructural damage:\n• \nNever store glycol of any kind near the boiler \nor any potential ignition source.\n• \nMonitor and inspect the system and boiler \nregularly for leakage. Repair any leaks im-\nmediately to prevent possible accumulation \nof glycol.\n• \nNever use automotive antifreeze or ethylene \nglycol in the system. Using these glycols can \nlead to hazardous leakage of glycol in the \nboiler system. \nWhen servicing boiler —\n• \nTo avoid electric shock, disconnect electrical supply \nbefore performing maintenance.\n• \nTo avoid severe burns, allow boiler to cool before \nperforming maintenance.\nBoiler operation —\n• \nDo not block flow of combustion or ventilation air to \nboiler.\n• \nShould overheating occur or gas supply fail to shut \noff, do not turn off or disconnect electrical supply to \ncirculator.

This water heater is \ndesigned to reduce the risk of ﬂ ammable vapour related ﬁ res \nby shutting the burner down before ﬂ ammable vapours get \ninto the water heater combustion chamber. This is achieved by \nthe means of the ﬂ ammable vapour sensor. Properly installed \nand maintained, it will provide years of trouble free service.\nThis gas-ﬁ red water heater has been developed to produce \npotable hot water for normal residential demands and may \nalso be used in combination with space heating applications \nbut not space heating only.\n User Responsibilities\nThis manual has been prepared to acquaint you with the \ninstallation, operation and maintenance of your gas ﬁ red \nwater heater and provide important safety information in these \nareas. It is your responsibility to ensure that your water heater \nis properly installed and cared for.\nFAILURE TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THIS \nMANUAL MAY RESULT IN SERIOUS BODILY INJURY \nAND/OR PROPERTY DAMAGE. THOROUGHLY READ \nAND UNDERSTAND ALL INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE YOU \nATTEMPT TO INSTALL, OPERATE OR MAINTAIN THIS \nHEATER.\nInstallation and service requires trade knowledge in the areas \nof plumbing, electricity, venting, air supply and gas supply. \nOnly a qualiﬁ ed service technician shall install or service this \nwater heater.\nService to the Power Vent System should only be performed \nby a qualiﬁ ed service technician.\nThe manufacturer of this water heater will not assume any \nliability for any property damage, personal injury or death \nresulting from improper sizing, installation or failure to comply \nwith these instructions.\n Qualified Installer Or Service Agency\nInstallation and service of this water heater requires ability \nequivalent to that of a Qualiﬁ ed Agency in the ﬁ eld involved. \nInstallation skills such as plumbing, air supply, venting, \ngas supply and electrical supply are required in addition to \nelectrical testing skills when performing service.\nDo not discard this manual. You or future users of this \nwater heater will need it for reference.\n \n– 3 –\nSAFETY\nThis water heater is design-certiﬁ ed by CSA International as \na Category III, water heater that takes its combustion and \ndilution air either from the installation area or from air ducted \nto the unit from the outside.\nIn addition to the installation instructions found in this manual, \nthe water heater must be installed in accordance with \nprovincial codes and the latest edition of \"Natural Gas and \nPropane Installation Code\" CSA-B149.1.\n Safety Warning (Flammable Vapours)\nWARNING\nFlammable Vapours\nFLAMMABLES\nFIRE AND EXPLOSION HAZARD\nCan result in serious injury or death\n        Do not store or use gasoline or other flammable vapours and liquids \nin the vicinity of this or any other appliance. Storage of or use of gasoline \nor other flammable vapours or liquids in the vicinity of this or any other \nappliance can result in serious injury or death.\nThere is a risk of property damage, personal injury or death \nfrom the by-products of combustion (e.g., ﬂ ue gases), in \nusing fuel-burning appliances such as water heaters. Areas \nthat may not be suitable for water heater installation include \nthose where ﬂ ammable liquids, gasoline, solvents, adhesives \netc. are stored. Also not suitable are areas where engine-\ndriven equipment is stored, operated or repaired. Flammable \nvapour products should not be stored or used near the water \nheater or air intake. Due to the nature of air movement, \nﬂ ammable vapours can be carried some distance from the \npoint of storage. Although the safety system is designed to \nreduce the risk of ﬂ ammable vapour related ﬁ res, the gas-\nﬁ red water heater igniter or burner ﬂ ame can ignite these \nvapours causing a ﬂ ashback, ﬁ re or explosion, which may \nresult in severe property damage, serious personal injury or \ndeath. If ﬂ ammable liquids or vapours have spilled or leaked \nin the area of the water heater, leave the area immediately \nand call the ﬁ re department from a neighbor's home. Do not \nattempt to clean the spill until all ignition sources have been \nextinguished.\n Safety Warning (Scalding)\nDANGER\nHot water produced by this appliance can cause severe burns \ndue to scalding. The hazard is increased for young children, \nthe aged or the disabled when water temperatures exceed \n52°C (125°F). Use tempering valves, also known as mixing \nvalves, in the hot-water system to reduce the risk of scalding \nat point-of-use such as lavatories, sinks and bathing facilities \n(see Figures 11 & 12). Such precautions must be followed \nwhen this heater is operated in combination with dishwashing \nor space heating applicati",

This unit details four areas where significant requirements for the installation, operation, and testing of large piping and tubing systems should be understood by the gas technician/fitter .\nUnit 12-Controls: Fundamentals\nObjectives \nAt the end of this unit you will be able to:\nDescribe control concepts and components\nExplain the basic control system\nDescribe operating controllers\nDescribe combustion and safety controls\nDescribe ignition control modules\nDescribe valves and regulators\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nOverview:\nPurpose: \nA gas technician/fitter will regularly encounter numerous types of controls. The fundamentals of the operation of these controls are also numerous. Knowing how controls work, where they are applied, and how they interact with other controls is important to understanding overall systems.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nObjectives:\n At the end of this chapter you will be able to: \n•\tDescribe control concepts and components.\n•\tExplain the basic control system.\n•\tDescribe operating controllers.\n•\tDescribe limit and safety controllers.\n•\tDescribe combustion and safety controls.\n•\tDescribe ignition control modules.\n•\tDescribe valves and regulators.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nControl Concepts and Components:\n\tControl systems used in the gas industry use the physical characteristics of solids, liquids, and gases to expand and contract, and to conduct or resist electricity as a means of regulating the burner system. For example, physical characteristics associated with the expansion of solids and liquids, electromagnetism, the thermoelectric effect, and electricity are all used in varying capacities. \nEach of the founding principles is discussed below, with examples of controls that operate on these principles.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nThermal Expansion of Solids:\n\tMetals expand when heated and contract when cooled. The principle of the thermal expansion of solids is used for several control devices that regulate temperature change. \nTemperature Disc: \nThe temperature snap disc (trademark Klixon) responds to temperature changes by moving from a concave to convex shape, touching electrical contacts and completing a circuit. The temperature disc can be used in the thermal relay.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nBi-Metallic Strip:\n\tThe bimetallic strip operates on the fact that not all metals expand at the same rate. This device uses the warping action created when two dissimilar metals having different coefficients of expansion are welded together at one end and exposed to temperature change. Since one end of the bimetallic strip is anchored solidly, the free end moves up or down with an increase or decrease in temperature. The resulting curling or bending is used to control the opening or closing of electrical contacts.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nElectrical Heating of a Resistive Element:\nMost materials conduct electrical current to some degree and heat up as a result. The amount of heat created depends on the current flow through the resistor and the material's electrical resistance. \nThe functions of the bimetallic strip can be tied in with a change in voltage by wrapping a heat resistive wire around the strip. When voltage is applied, the current drawn by the wire will create heat, causing the bimetal to warp and open/close electrical contacts.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nRod and Tube:\n\tThe rod and tube control device also works on the principle that some metals expand more quickly than others. In this control device the sensing portion of the valve is constructed of copper tube that has a high expansion/ contraction rate. The copper tube encases an in var rod, a metal alloy with a low expansion/ contraction rate. The invar rod and copper tube are welded together at the far end so the expansion and contraction of the copper tube effectively moves the invar rod back and forth, opening and closing a switch.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nThermal Expansion of Liquids:\n\tLike solids, liquids expand when heated and contract when cooled. When liquid is sealed in a narrow tube ( called a capillary) the force created by the liquid expanding within the capillary is used to operate an electrical switch or control mechanism.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nSealed Bellows:\n\tIn the sealed bellows control device, liquid inside a bulb at one end of the capillary senses the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere and expands or contracts. At the other end of the capillary an attached bellows reacts to the pressure within the capillary by expanding or contracting. One advantage of the capillary tube is that it allows the bulb to be located remotely from the bellows.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nThe action of the bellows is used to operate:\nA switching device-completing or interrupting an electrical circuit\n• A mechanism that controls the gas valve outlet-modulating the gas supply to the main burner\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nThe liquid in the bulb may be fluid fill or mercury, depending on the temperatures that will be encountered. \nFluid Fill:\nSealed bellows used to operate thermostats may have a temperature limit of 650°F (343°C) and usually contain a fluid similar to a light oil. The expansion or contraction of this type of fill is quite linear and gives a smooth operation of the thermostat. \nAlways check the manufacturer's specification for recommended temperature and pressure limits.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nMercury: \nFor high temperatures, such as 3000°F (1648°C) reached in pilot safety controls, the bulb must be filled with mercury. The expansion of the mercury is smooth up to approximately 650°F (343°C), at which point the mercury vapourizes (boils). With vapourization, a rapid expansion takes place, giving the control \"snap action.\" Similarly, upon cooling, there is a rapid contraction as the vapour condenses to a liquid.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nElectromagnetism:\n\tWhen an electrical current is passed through a metal rod (called a conductor), a magnetic field surrounds the conductor. This principle has been put to use in creating the electromagnet, which forms the basis for the solenoid used in many control devices. Most electrical control devices use solenoids to produce physical motion.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nSolenoids:\nA solenoid is an electromagnetic device that creates a magnetic field around an actuating component converting electrical energy to a mechanical force. \nWhen current runs through the solenoid coil it creates a magnetic force inside the space it surrounds. A piece of iron, called an armature, becomes a temporary magnet when it is in the magnetic field. If it is partially inside the coil, the temporary magnet will be pulled into the centre of the coil when the circuit is closed. When the circuit is opened, the magnetic field dies, and the armature is free to move to its original position, frequently with the assistance of a small spring return action.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nThermoelectric Effect:\n\tThe thermoelectric effect of producing electricity by heat is used for the thermocouple and thermopile. \nThese sections and devices are covered in detail in the 11 Basic Electricity for Gas Fired Equipment unit.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nThermocouple:\nA thermocouple uses the combined effects of temperature change and electricity. It consists of a bimetallic strip joined at one end (called the hot junction). When the hot junction is heated, a de voltage is generated across to the other two ends of the strips (the cold junction). \nThe thermocouple is used to prove the pilot flame; if it goes out, the thermocouple prevents the main gas valve from opening.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nThe magnitude of the voltage across to the cold junction depends on the: \nTwo materials of the bimetallic strip\nTemperature difference between the hot and cold junctions\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nThermopile:\nThe output of a single thermocouple is very small: 20 to 30 millivolts (1000 millivolts= 1 volt). By placing a number of single thermocouples in series electrically, a device known as a thermopile can be created that generates hundreds of millivolts.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nWheatstone Bridge Principle:\nElectrical circuitry has used resistors (R) in many applications to control the flow of current in systems for many years. However, most resistors are now made using semi-conductors as described in the Semi-conductors and Solid State Electronics section. The Wheatstone bridge circuit is used in both electrical-mechanical and electronic control systems.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nThe circuit shown is based on the Wheatstone bridge principle. The principle states that when the ratio of Rl to R2 is the same as the ratio of R3 to R4, the circuit is in balance (i.e., there is no current flow between A and B).\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nElectronic Balancing Application:\nThe Wheatstone bridge principle can be used in control devices and is used in some electronic thermostat controls for water heaters. As long as a state of balance is maintained in the circuit there will be no current flow between points A and B. When the thermostat dial (R3) is set to a given temperature, an imbalance occurs that allows current to flow between A and B. This current is used to energize a relay, which in turn energizes the ignition control module. The circuit remains energized until the resistance of the sensor (R4) changes sufficiently to rebalance the ratio between Ri/R2 and R3/R4. At",

\n \nNotes: \nStatic pressure is measured to interpret airflow in a system.  Generally, manufacturers’ engineering manuals rate \nairflow in furnaces and air handlers based on “Total External Static Pressure” (TESP).  A typical furnace is designed \nto operate around .50 in. w.c.. If there is more than .50 inches TESP, the fan  may not be moving the required air \nflow.  You should always check the fan capacity of the furnaces and air handlers you select carefully, the pressure \ncapacities will range from .05‐ to 1.0 in.   \nStatic Pressure Testing:  \nTo determine Total External Static Pressure of a furnace you first measure the supply (+) pressure near the \ndischarge of the unit, between the furnace and the coil. (Test Point “C”)  Next, you measure the return (‐) \npressure near the inlet of the unit, often between the filter and the furnace. . (Test Point “B”)  Then you add the \ntwo pressures together to determine the system’s TESP.  When adding the positive and negative pressures \ntogether ignore the + and – signs. These only indicate the type of pressure measured.  Compare the measured \nTESP to the rated pressure capacity found on the appliance rating plate. \n \n

After checking with Instructor, utilize a manometer and operational furnace, to measure and record air pressure readings during normal and abnormal operational conditions at various indicated points in the table below\nNote:  Test Point “B” (after filter) can be measured inside furnace burner compartment if necessary (hole located inside/bottom) See instructor for location.\nSupply, Return, and Total External Static Pressures\nNotes:\nStatic pressure is measured to interpret airflow in a system.  Generally, manufacturers’ engineering manuals rate airflow in furnaces and air handlers based on “Total External Static Pressure” (TESP).  A typical furnace is designed to operate around .50 in. w.c.. If there is more than .50 inches TESP, the fan  may not be moving the required air flow.  You should always check the fan capacity of the furnaces and air handlers you select carefully, the pressure capacities will range from .05‐ to 1.0 in.\nStatic Pressure Testing:\nTo determine Total External Static Pressure of a furnace you first measure the supply (+) pressure near the discharge of the unit, between the furnace and the coil. (Test Point “C”)  Next, you measure the return (‐) pressure near the inlet of the unit, often between the filter and the furnace. . (Test Point “B”)  Then you add the two pressures together to determine the system’s TESP.  When adding the positive and negative pressures together ignore the + and – signs. These only indicate the type of pressure measured.  Compare the measured TESP to the rated pressure capacity found on the appliance rating plate.\nWhat was the Total External Static Pressure as indicated on Rating plate and how did it compare with your readings under normal and restricted conditions?\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n_____________________________________________________________________________\nWhat effect would a higher or lower fan speed or  larger or smaller ductwork have on your readings?\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n_____________________________________________________________________________\nAir Filter “Pressure Drop” Readings\nWhat effect did a blocked filter have on the operation of the furnace?\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n_____________________________________________________________________________\nWhat effect did a blocked filter have on the amperage draw of the blower motor?\n_____________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________\n5) Indicate the Motor amperage reading with no restrictions: _____________amps\n6) Indicate the Motor amperage reading with the filter blocked: _____________amps\nCoil Pressure Drop\nInstructor Sign Off  _________________",

It is used for high limit or low limit control. \nWhen used as a controller or as a low limit, a separate \nhigh limit must be used.\nL4006B makes the circuit on a temperature rise. It is \nused as a circulator controller, delaying circulator \noperation when boiler water temperature is below the \ncontrol setting.\nL4006E,H includes a trip-free manual reset switch. \nThese models are designed to break the control circuit \nwhenever the temperature of the controlled medium \nreaches the high limit setting. A reset button on the front \nof the case must be pressed to re-establish the control \ncircuit. L4006H also includes bracket and clamp for \nsurface mounting on pipe or tank.\nA plastic bag of heat-conductive compound is included \nwith the L4006A,B,E Aquastat® Controllers for use when \nthe sensing bulb is inserted into a well designed for a \nlarge bulb than the one used on the L4006A,B,E. A \n124904 Well Adapter, for use on old wells that do not fit \nthe L4006A,B,E immersion well clamp, can be ordered; \nsee form 68-0040, Wells and Fittings for Temperature \nControllers. A setting stop is included to prevent setting \nabove a desired temperature on limit.\nIf a well adapter or other accessories are needed, refer to \nform 68-0040, Wells and Fittings for Temperature \nControllers, for part numbers and ordering information.\nINSTALLATION\nWhen Installing This Product…\n1.\nRead these instructions carefully. Failure to follow \nthem could damage the product or cause a \nhazardous condition.\n2.\nCheck the ratings given in the instructions and on \nthe product to make sure the product is suitable for \nyour application.\n3.\nInstaller must be a trained, experienced service \ntechnician.\n4.\nAfter installation is complete, check out product \noperation as provided in these instructions.\nWARNING\nElectrical Shock Hazard.\nCan cause serious injury, death or equipment \ndamage.\nDisconnect the power supply before beginning \ninstallation to prevent electrical shock or \nequipment damage.\nInstalling Immersion Well Models \n(L4006A,B,E)\nIMPORTANT\nObtain the best thermal response with a well \nthat snugly fits the sensing bulb. The bulb \nshould be inserted until it rests against the \nbottom of the well. Use a well of correct length \nand bend the tubing, if necessary, to provide \nenough force to hold the bulb against the \nbottom of the well. Do not make a sharp bend in \nthe tubing. A sharp bend can produce a break in \nthe tubing and cause a loss of fill. This condition \nwill cause the high and low limit controls to be \nmade continuously.\nIf the well is not a snug fit on the bulb, use the \nheat-conductive compound as follows. Fold the \nplastic bag of compound lengthwise and twist \ngently. Snip the end of the bag and insert into \nthe well. Slowly pull out the bag while squeezing \nfirmly to distribute the compound evenly in the \nwell. Insert the bulb into the well. Bend the \ntubing, if necessary, to provide force to hold the \nbulb against the bottom of the well and to hold \nthe out end of the bulb in firm contact with the \nside of the well. Wipe off any excess compound.\nNOTE:\nSome models have an adjustable capillary \ntubing length to 3 inches (76 mm). In these \nmodels, pull out extra tubing from inside the \ncase, if needed. \nFollow the boiler manufacturer instructions, if available; \notherwise, proceed as follows.\nL4006A,B,E,H AQUASTAT® CONTROLLERS\n60-0915—5\n2\n1.\nRemove the old control.\n2.\nRefer to the cover insert of the old control to identify \nand tag each lead as it is disconnected. \n3.\nLeave the old well in place if it is suitable.\nIf Well is Otherwise Suitable But Does Not Fit The \nL4006 Immersion Well Clamp\nUse a 124904 Well Adapter (order separately, see form \n68-0040) to secure the L4006 to the old well. The adapter \nhas a flange at one end for fastening the L4066 adapter \nclamp.\n1.\nLoosen, but do not remove, the two adapter clamp \nscrews (see Fig. 1).\n2.\nSlide the adapter onto the capillary and short tube; \nsee Fig. 2 inset.\n3.\nMake sure the flanged end of the adapter fits into \nthe hole in the case. Position the adapter well clamp \nsnugly over the flange on the adapter, then tighten \nthe clamp screws.\n4.\nInsert the bulb into the well, as shown in Fig. 2. If \nnecessary, use the heat-conductive compound as \ninstructed in the IMPORTANT statement on page 1.\n5.\nTighten the setscrew (if one is present in the old \nwell spud) against the adapter.\nFig. 1. Internal view of L4006A,B with horizontal well. \nL4006E is the same with reset button added.\nFig. 2. Bulb in immersion well and use of adapter.\nIf the Old Well Is Unsuitable.\n1.\nDrain the system and remove the well. \n2.\nSelect a new well from form 68-0040 (order well \nseparately).\n3.\nInstall the new well, refill the system and check for \nleaks.\n4.\nLoosen, but do not remove, the two adapter clamp \nscrews (Fig. 1).\n5.\nInsert the sensing bulb into the well until it bottoms \nas show in Fig. 2.

Breaks circulator circuit at \ntemperature setting minus differential and remakes \nat setting.\nADJUSTMENT\nSet the differential to correspond with the boiler \nmanufacturer recommendations. To adjust models with \nadjustable differential, rotate the wheel on the back of the \nsnap switch until the desired reading is aligned with the V \nnotch in the frame. The wheel provides an adjustment \nfrom 5°F to 30°F (3°C to 17°C). Replace the cover on the \nAquastat Controller.\nAdjust the control point to correspond with the boiler \nmanufacturer recommendations. To  adjust, insert a \nscrewdriver in the slotted screw type head located \nbeneath the window in the cover. Turn the scale to the \ndesired control point.\nManual Reset\nWhen the device includes manual reset (L4006E and H), \nbe sure to press the red reset button on the front of the \ncase to make sure that the controller is not locked out on \nsafe",

Read these instructions carefully. Failure to follow \nthem could damage the product or cause a hazard­\nous condition. \n2.  Check the ratings given in the instructions and on \nthe product to make sure the product is suitable for \nyour application. \n3.  Installer must be a trained, experienced service \ntechnician. \n4.  After installation is complete, check out product \noperation as provided in these instructions. \nCAUTION \nDisconnect power supply before installation to \nprevent electrical shock or equipment damage. \nDepending on model and installation requirements, install \nthe temperature sensing bulb either in an immersion well \n(see Fig. 2) that extends into the boiler or tank, or directly \nimmerse the temperature sensing bulb in the liquid. For \ninstallations not using a well, secure the bulb with a bulb \ncompression fitting (see Fig. 3), or a capillary compression \nfitting (see Fig. 4). Order the well or the fitting separately. \nThe boiler manufacturer generally provides a tapping for \ninserting the Aquastat® controller sensing element. Locate \nthis tapping in a representative point where typical water \ntemperature can be measured. Never locate the bulb or \nprotecting immersion well close to a hot or cold water inlet \nor steam coil. Install the bulb in the supply line of an \nindirect water heater, in the indirect water heater itself, or \nin the feed riser about 6 in. (152 mm) above the boiler. If \nthe riser is valved, install the bulb between the boiler and \nthe valve. \n95-5971-2\nL4008A,B,E,L; L6008A,G,H REMOTE BULB AQUASTAT® CONTROLLERS \nThe Aquastat® controller can be remotely mounted— \neither vertically on a wall or panel, or directly on the boiler, \ntank, or vessel. \nIf the system is filled, drain the system to a point below the \nboiler tapping, or to wherever the sensing bulb is to be \ninstalled. \nMounting the Case \n\u0001  Remove the cover and fasten the case to the wall or \npanel using the three mounting holes in the back of \nthe case. \n\u0002  When mounting the remote bulb, if desirable, route \nthe tubing to run through any of the other three \ncorner notches in the case. Be careful not to kink or \nbend tubing sharply. Be sure bends have at least 1 in. \n(25.4 mm) radius. \nInstalling Remote Bulb with Immersion Well \nFit well, if used, to sensing bulb snugly for good thermal \nresponse. Insert bulb until it rests against the bottom of the \nwell; then hold it there while tightening the tubing clamp. \n\u0001  Screw the well into the boiler, tank or pipe tapping. \n\u0002  Insert the bulb into the well, pushing the tubing until \nthe bulb bottoms in the well. \n\u0003  Attach the retainer clamp to the end of the well spud. \nLoosen the draw nut and spread the jaws of the \nclamp with the screwdriver if necessary. \n\u0004  With the retainer clamp attached to the well spud (be \nsure jaws of clamp hook over ridge at end of the \nspud, as shown in Fig. 2, points A). Adjust tubing to fit \nthrough retainer clamp groove, as shown at point B. \n\u0005  Tighten the draw nut so the retainer clamp is firmly \nattached to the well spud and the tubing is held by \nthe clamp. \nINSERT— MOUNTING CLAMP \nSCREWDRIVER \nSPREAD JAWS \nTO FIT OVER \nRIDGE ON \nWELL SPUD \nJAWS \nDRAW \nM8777 \nWELL \nBULB \nSPUD \nMOUNTING \nCLAMP \nA \nNUT \nTUBING \nB \nFig. 2.

The “Superflue”™ series is\ndesigned to vent the products of combustion (flue gases)\nhorizontally through an exterior wall or vertically through the\nroof using an integrated blower assembly and plastic piping,\nwithout the need for a conventional chimney.\nImportant Consumer Notice\nThese instructions have been  written for the proper installation,\nsafe operation and maintenance of this water heater.\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that your water heater is\nproperly installed and cared for. FAILURE TO\nFOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THIS\nMANUAL MAY RESULT IN SERIOUS\nBODILY INJURY AND /OR PROPERTY\nDAMAGE.\nTHOROUGHLY READ ALL\nINSTRUCTIONS before you attempt to install or\noperate this heater.\nInstallation and service require trade knowledge in the area of\nplumbing, electricity, venting, air supply and gas supply. If you\nlack these skills or do not understand these instructions, enlist\nthe help of a qualified professional.\nGSW Water Heating, the manufacturer of this water heater,\ncannot be held liable for those damages caused by improper\ninstallation, sizing or failure to comply with these instructions.\nProtect your warranty: Regularly maintain your\nwater  heater and venting  system as detailed in the service and\nmaintenance section of this  manual.\nApprovals\nNatural gas and propane gas models of this water heater have\nbeen certified for operation by the Canadian Standards\nAssociation (CSA). This heater is approved to provide potable\nhot water or when combined with a  suitably-sized fan coil,\nbaseboard heater, etc., to provide both space heating and\ndomestic hot water.\nInstallation Code Requirements\nCanadian Installations\nIn addition to the installation instructions found in this manual,\nthe heater shall be installed in accordance with the latest\nedition  of CSA B149. Natural Gas and Propane Installation\ncode and/or any local codes. These shall be carefully followed\nin all cases.\nAuthorities having jurisdiction shall be consulted before\ninstallations are made.\nAll electrical connections shall be in accordance with the latest\nedition of the Canadian Electrical Code CSA C22•1 Part 1.\nU.S. Installations\nIn addition to the installation instructions found in this manual,\nthe heater shall be installed in accordance with the latest\nedition of the National Fuel Gas Code ANSI Z223•1 (NFPA 54)\nand/or any local codes. These shall be carefully followed in all\ncases. Authorities having jurisdiction shall be consulted before\ninstallations are made.\nImportant: All supply equipment, installation, Approvals,\npermits, inspections, etc. are the responsibility of the owner of\nthis water heater.  Consult your local authorities for regulations\nspecific to your area. \nRelief Valves (T&P)\nAll heaters must be installed with a proper temperature and\npressure relief valve. These valves must be certified as meeting\nthe requirements for Relief Valves and Automatic Gas Shut-Off\nDevices for Hot Water Supply Systems, ANSI Z21•22 in the\nUnited States. When in Canada, the Standard for Temperature,\nPressure, Temperature and Pressure Relief and Vacuum Relief\nCAN 4•4 is required.\nBackflow Prevention \nCertain jurisdictions may require the installation of a  backflow\ndevice (e.g., check valve) in the water supply line. Such a\ndevice will require the use of a  system  expansion tank of\nadequate size to control the thermal expansion generated\nduring the heating cycle. Consult your water supplier or local\nplumbing authority.\nImportant: The supply water meter may have a built-in\ncheck valve device. Contact your local water authority.\nSafety Warnings\n•\nWater Heaters are heat-producing appliances. To avoid\ndamage or injury, no materials shall be stored against the\nheater and provision shall be made to prevent unauthorized\ncontact (e.g. children).\nFOR YOUR SAFETY, DO NOT STORE\nOR USE GASOLINE OR OTHER\nFLAMMABLE,\nCOMBUSTIBLE \nOR\nCORROSIVE VAPORS OR LIQUIDS IN\nTHE VICINITY OF THIS HEATER OR\nANY OTHER APPLIANCE.\n•\nHot water produced by this appliance can cause severe\nburns due to scalding. The hazard is increased for young\nchildren, the aged, or the disabled where water\ntemperatures exceed 1250 F (520C).\nUse anti-scald valves in the hot water system to  reduce the\nrisk of scalding at points of use such as  lavatories, sinks and\nbathing facilities. Such precautions must be followed when\nthis heater is operated in combination with dishwashing or\nspace heating applications.\n– 3 –\n•\nAs with all fuel burning equipment, this heater requires an\nadequate supply of air for combustion and ventilation. An\ninsufficient air supply can result in poor combustion or the re-\ncirculation of the exhaust flue gases. Such a condition can\ncause sooting or present a fire hazard, which  may result in\nserious bodily harm or death from asphyxiation.\nMAKE \nSURE \nTHE \nFLOW \nOF\nCOMBUSTION AND VENTILATION AIR IS\nNOT RESTRICTED.\n•\nIf this water heater has been exposed to flooding, freezing,\nfire or any unusual condition, do not put it into operation until\nit has been inspected and approved by a qualified\nprofessional. THESE CONDITIONS CAN RESULT\nIN UNSEEN INTERNAL DAMAGE and are not\nsubject to warranty coverage.\nSafety Warnings\n•\nThere is a risk in using fuel-burning appliances such as\nwater heaters. Areas that may not be suitable for water\nheater installation include those where flammable liquids,\ngasoline, solvents, adhesives, etc., or engine-driven\nequipment or vehicles are  stored, operated or repaired. Due\nto the nature of air movement, flammable  vapors can be\ncarried some distance from the point of storage. The gas-\nfired water heater igniter or main burner flame can ignite\nthese vapors causing a flashback, fire or explosion which\nmay result in serious personal injury or death, as well as\nsevere property damage.\nIf installation in a garage or shed is the only option, it is\nrequired that the water heater be elevated a minimum of 18”\n(45 cm) above the floor level. This may reduce, BUT NOT\nELIMINATE, the risk of flammable vapors being ignited.\nSuch installations must be protected from impact or physical\ndamage caused from moving equipment or vehicles.\nCHECK LOCAL CODES !\n•\nExposure to air borne chemicals  can cause  severe\ncorrosion to the water heater and damage to the venting\nparts. Air containing vapors from cleaning solvents, pool\nchemicals, refrigerator or air conditioning refrigerants,\nlaundry detergents or bleaches, waxes, spray can\npropellants, dry cleaning, photo processing ",

DIPTUBE\nFigure 1\n-1-\nI) DESCRIPTION\nThe “Superflue” series of water heaters can be installed\nto vent the products of combustion horizontally through\nthe wall or vertically through the roof. A blower is used\nto expel the products of combustion by means of plas-\ntic piping to the outdoors without the need for a con-\nventional chimney.\nBefore installing this heater, consideration must be\ngiven to these installation details:\n1.\nThe best location for the outdoor vent terminal.\n2.\nWhere and how to route the vent pipes.\n3.\nThis heater may create blower / air noise. Do not\nlocate near sleeping quarters.\n4.\nWhere and how to obtain combustion, ventilation,\nand dilution air.\n5.\nWhere the cold water supply is, and how to feed\nhot water into the system.\n6.\nWhere the gas supply is located.\n7.\nWhere the electric receptacle is located.\nThese issues are interrelated and will help determine\nthe best location. It is suggested that each parameter\nbe looked at individually without losing sight of the\nother parameters. \nThese instructions have been written for the proper\ninstallation and safe operation of this heater.\nAPPROVALS – WATER HEATING, \nCOMBO HEATING\nThis heater has been approved by the Canadian\nStandards Association as a water heater to provide\ndomestic hot water, and with the addition of a suitable\nfan coil and / or baseboard radiators for combination\nwater heating and space heating application.\nWhere a water heater is intended to supply both\ndomestic hot water and space heating, a proper heat\nsurvey (heat loss) calculation must be done to deter-\nmine if the heater will supply sufficient energy to handle\nthe anticipated load. See Section VIII) – Combo\nHeating.\nWARNING\nThis heater must be installed in accordance with these\ninstructions and local building codes.  It must be\ninstalled with a proper temperature and pressure relief\nvalve, which may release water in normal operation.\nTemperature and pressure relief valves installed, must\nbe certified as meeting the requirements for the\nStandard for Temperature, Pressure, Temperature and\nPressure Relief and Vaccum Relief CSA 4•4, in\nCanada.  When in the United States the Requirements\nfor Relief Valves and Automatic Gas Shut-Off Devices\nfor Hot Water Supply Systems, ANSI Z21•22, is\nrequired.  These valves must be installed in the open-\ning marked for this purpose, at the time of installation of\nthe water heater.\nIt is possible that connections to the water heater, or\nthe water heater itself, may develop leaks. It is there-\nfore imperative that the water heater be installed so that\nany water is directed to an adequate drain in such a\nway that it cannot damage the building, furniture, car-\npeting or other property subject to water damage. GSW\ncannot be held responsible for damage caused by\nwater from the water heater, pressure relief valve or\nrelated fittings where adequate provision to drain such\nwater has not been made. Closets without drains and\ncarpeted areas are examples of unsuitable locations for\nany water heater.\nIf such a location cannot be avoided, or when the\nheater is installed on a mezzanine or multi–level build-\ning where water leakage may damage lower floors, a\nsuitable drain pan must be installed. This drain pan\nmust be at least 1 - 1/2” deep and be provided with a\npipe that directs overflow water to a suitable drain. This\ndrain pan must not restrict combustion air flow.\nCAUTION\nIf it is inevitable that this heater has to be installed\ndirectly on carpeting, the carpeting must be protected\nby a metal or wood panel beneath the appliance,\nextending beyond the full width and depth of the appli-\nance by at least 3 inches in any direction, or if the appli-\nance is installed in a closet or alcove, the entire floor\nmust be covered by the panel. This panel must be\nstrong enough to carry the weight of the heater full of\nwater. Failure to heed this warning may result in a fire\nhazard.\nThe installation must conform to one or more\nof the following as applicable:\nCANADIAN INSTALLATIONS\n1.\nThe latest edition of CSA B149.1 Natural Gas and\nPropane Installation Code\n2.\nPublic Utility and/or Local Codes\nU.S. INSTALLATIONS\n1.\nThe latest edition of the National Fuel Gas Code\nANSI Z 223.1\n2.\nPublic Utility and/or Local Codes\nThe venting system of this unit must be used and\ninstalled strictly in accordance with the instructions con-\ntained in the  “Venting” section of this manual.\n-2-\nSAFETY WARNING\nWater heaters are heat producing appliances. To\navoid damage or injury, there shall be no materials\nstored against the water heater and proper care shall\nbe taken to avoid unnecessary contact (especially by\nchildren) with the water heater. \nINSTALLATION CLEARANCES\nThe minimum clearances between the heater and\ncombustible material are:\nSides and Rear\n1”\nFlue Pipe\n0”\nJacket Top to Ceiling\n8” *\nFlue Pipe Through Wall\n0”\n*\nFor 40 and 50 gallon models, it is recommended\nthat a 36” clearance from jacket top to ceiling be\nmaintained in order to have sufficient room for\nanode replacement should this become neces-\nsary. For 60 gallon models, a 42” clearance is rec-\nommended. \nThis water heater is certified for installation on a com-\nbustible floor.\nA minimum clearance of 24\" in front should be provid-\ned for inspection and servicing.\nThis heater is approved for alcove and closet type\ninstallation, but maintain the minimum clearances to\ncombustible material listed above.\nII) VENTING\nCOMBUSTION AIR SUPPLY\nAn adequate air supply shall be provided for combus-\ntion and ventilation. An insufficient supply of air will\ncause recirculation of combustion products resulting in\nair contamination that may be hazardous to life.\nWhen an exhaust fan is installed in the same room with\nthis water heater, sufficient openings for air must be\nprovided. Undersized openings will cause air to be\ndrawn into the room through the exhaust vent.\nUnconfined Spaces\nIn unconfined spaces in buildings of other than unusu-\nally tight construction, infiltration may be adequate to\nprovide air for combustion, ventilation and dilution of\nflue gases. Unconfined space is defined as a space\nwhose volume is not less than 50 cubic feet per 1,000\nBTU/hour of the combined input rating of all appli-\nances installed in that space. Rooms directly adjoining\nthe space in which the appliances are installed,\nthrough openings and not furnished with doors, are\nconsidered part of the unconfined space.\nConfined Spaces \n(Less than 50 cubic feet",

Since more than 90% of the total flame radiation\nis infrared, these detectors receive ample radiation and can\ndetect weak flames as well as flames of higher intensity.\nThe lead sulfide cell used in the detector cannot distin-\nguish between the infrared radiation emitted by hot refractory\nand the infrared radiation from a flame. Therefore, the\ninfrared detection system includes an amplifier that responds\nonly to the flickering characteristic of flame radiation and\nrejects the steady radiation characteristic of hot refractory.\nUnfortunately, smoke or fuel mist within the combustion\nchamber can intermittently reflect, bend, or block the hot\nrefractory radiation, thus making it fluctuate. This fluctuating\naction can simulate the flickering radiation from a flame, and\ninfrared radiation may be present even after the refractory has\nvisibly stopped glowing. Therefore, be very careful when\napplying an infrared detection system to be sure it responds\nonly to flame.\nCELL CONSTRUCTION\nThe photosensitive material used in the infrared detector\nis lead sulfide. The electrical resistance of lead sulfide de-\ncreases when exposed to infrared radiation. If a voltage is\napplied across the lead sulfide photocell, current flows when\nthe cell is exposed to infrared radiation.\nInstallation\nWHEN INSTALLING THIS PRODUCT…\n1. Read these instructions carefully. Failure to follow\nthem could damage the product or cause a hazardous condi-\ntion.\n2. Check the ratings given in the instructions and on the\nproduct to make sure the product is suitable for your applica-\ntion.\n3. Installer must be a trained, experienced flame safe-\nguard control service technician.\n4. After installation is complete, check out product opera-\ntion as provided in these instructions.\nCAUTION\n1. Disconnect power supply before beginning in-\nstallation to prevent electrical shock and equip-\nment damage, there may be more than one\ndisconnect.\n2. All wiring must be NEC Class 1 (line voltage).\n3. Use the C7015A only with Honeywell lead\nsulfide photocells (part no.",

Do not\nlocate near sleeping quarters.\n4.\nWhere and how to obtain combustion, ventilation,\nand dilution air.\n5.\nWhere the cold water supply is, and how to feed\nhot water into the system.\n6.\nWhere the gas supply is located.\n7.\nWhere the electric receptacle is located.\nThese issues are interrelated and will help determine\nthe best location. It is suggested that each parameter\nbe looked at individually without losing sight of the\nother parameters. \nThese instructions have been written for the proper\ninstallation and safe operation of this heater.\nAPPROVALS – WATER HEATING, \nCOMBO HEATING\nThis heater has been approved by the Canadian\nStandards Association as a water heater to provide\ndomestic hot water, and with the addition of a suitable\nfan coil and / or baseboard radiators for combination\nwater heating and space heating application.\nWhere a water heater is intended to supply both\ndomestic hot water and space heating, a proper heat\nsurvey (heat loss) calculation must be done to\ndetermine if the heater will supply sufficient energy to\nhandle the anticipated load. See Section VIII) –\nCombo Heating.\nWARNING\nThis heater must be installed in accordance with these\ninstructions and local building codes.  It must be\ninstalled with a proper temperature and pressure relief\nvalve, which may release water in normal operation.\nTemperature and pressure relief valves installed, must\nbe certified as meeting the requirements for the\nStandard for Temperature, Pressure, Temperature and\nPressure Relief and Vaccum Relief CSA 4•4, in\nCanada.  When in the United States the Requirements\nfor Relief Valves and Automatic Gas Shut-Off Devices\nfor Hot Water Supply Systems, ANSI Z21•22, is\nrequired.  These valves must be installed in the\nopening marked for this purpose, at the time of\ninstallation of the water heater.\nIt is possible that connections to the water heater, or\nthe water heater itself, may develop leaks. It is\ntherefore imperative that the water heater be installed\nso that any water is directed to an adequate drain in\nsuch a way that it cannot damage the building,\nfurniture, carpeting or other property subject to water\ndamage. GSW cannot be held responsible for damage\ncaused by water from the water heater, pressure relief\nvalve or related fittings where adequate provision to\ndrain such water has not been made. Closets without\ndrains and carpeted areas are examples of unsuitable\nlocations for any water heater.\nIf such a location cannot be avoided, or when the\nheater is installed on a mezzanine or multi–level\nbuilding where water leakage may damage lower\nfloors, a suitable drain pan must be installed. This\ndrain pan must be at least 1 - 1/2” deep and be\nprovided with a pipe that directs overflow water to a\nsuitable drain. This drain pan must not restrict\ncombustion air flow.\nCAUTION\nIf it is inevitable that this heater has to be installed\ndirectly on carpeting, the carpeting must be protected\nby a metal or wood panel beneath the appliance,\nextending beyond the full width and depth of the\nappliance by at least 3 inches in any direction, or if the\nappliance is installed in a closet or alcove, the entire\nfloor must be covered by the panel. This panel must\nbe strong enough to carry the weight of the heater full\nof water. Failure to heed this warning may result in a\nfire hazard.\nThe installation must conform to one or more\nof the following as applicable:\nCANADIAN INSTALLATIONS\n1.\nThe latest edition of CSA B149.1 Natural Gas and\nPropane Installation Code\n2.\nPublic Utility and/or Local Codes\nU.S. INSTALLATIONS\n1.\nThe latest edition of the National Fuel Gas Code\nANSI Z 223.1\n2.\nPublic Utility and/or Local Codes\nThe venting system of this unit must be used and\ninstalled strictly in accordance with the instructions\ncontained in the  “Venting” section of this manual.\n-2-\nSAFETY WARNING\nWater heaters are heat producing appliances. To\navoid damage or injury, there shall be no materials\nstored against the water heater and proper care shall\nbe taken to avoid unnecessary contact (especially by\nchildren) with the water heater. \nINSTALLATION CLEARANCES\nThe minimum clearances between the heater and\ncombustible material are:\nSides and Rear\n1”\nFlue Pipe\n0”\nJacket Top to Ceiling\n8” *\nFlue Pipe Through Wall\n0”\n*\nFor 40 and 50 gallon models, it is recommended\nthat a 36” clearance from jacket top to ceiling be\nmaintained in order to have sufficient room for\nanode replacement should this become\nnecessary. For 60 gallon models, a 42” clearance\nis recommended. \nThis water heater is certified for installation on a\ncombustible floor.\nA minimum clearance of 24\" in front should be\nprovided for inspection and servicing.\nThis heater is approved for alcove and closet type\ninstallation, but maintain the minimum clearances to\ncombustible material listed above.\nII) VENTING\nCOMBUSTION AIR SUPPLY\nAn adequate air supply shall be provided for\ncombustion and ventilation. An insufficient supply of air\nwill cause recirculation of combustion products\nresulting in air contamination that may be hazardous to\nlife.\nWhen an exhaust fan is installed in the same room\nwith this water heater, sufficient openings for air must\nbe provided. Undersized openings will cause air to be\ndrawn into the room through the exhaust vent.\nUnconfined Spaces\nIn unconfined spaces in buildings of other than\nunusually tight construction, infiltration may be\nadequate to provide air for combustion, ventilation and\ndilution of flue gases. Unconfined space is defined as\na space whose volume is not less than 50 cubic feet\nper 1,000 BTU/hour of the combined input rating of all\nappliances installed in that space. Rooms directly\nadjoining the space in which the appliances are\ninstalled, through openings and not furnished with\ndoors, are considered part of the unconfined space.\nConfined Spaces \n(Less than 50 cubic feet per 1,000 BTU/hour)\n(a) Air from Inside the Building.\nSee Table I and Figure 2.\nTable I  Confined Spac",

Immediately call a qualified service technician\nto inspect the furnace and to replace any part of the\ncontrol system and any gas control which has been\nunder water.\nIMPORTANT\nAny additions, changes, or conversions required in\norder for the appliance to satisfactorily meet the ap-\nplication needs must be made by a Lennox service\ntechnician using factory specified and approved\nparts.\nWARNING\nImproper installation, adjustment, alteration, service\nor maintenancecan cause property damage, person-\nal injury or loss of life. Installation and service must\nbe performed by a qualified installer, service agency\nor the gas supplier.\nImportant Directions\n1 - Keep the furnace area clear and free of combustible\nmaterial, gasoline, and other flammable vapors and\nliquids. If it is installed in an insulated area, the furnace\nmust be kept free of insulating material. Insulating ma-\nterial may be combustible.\n2 - DO NOT obstruct air flow to unit. Unit must receive an\nunobstructed flow of combustion and ventilating air.\n3 - DO NOT store chlorine or fluorine products near unit\nor introduce these products into the combustion air.\nThese products can cause furnace corrosion.\n4 - DO NOT draw return air from a room where this fur-\nnace, or any other gas appliance (ie., a water heat-\ner), is installed. When return air is drawn from a room,\na negative pressure is created in the room. If a gas ap-\npliance is operating in a room with negative pressure,\nthe flue products can be pulled back down the vent\npipe and into the room. This reverse flow of the flue\ngas may result in incomplete combustion and the\nformation of carbon monoxide gas. This toxic gas\nmight then be distributed throughout the house by the\nfurnace duct system.\nWARNING\nThe blower door must be securely in place when the\nblower and burners are operating. Gas fumes, which\ncould contain carbon monoxide, can be drawn into\nthe living space resulting in personal injury or death.\nYour furnace is a gas appliance. It is critical that the gas\nsupplied to the unit be completely burned to avoid the pro-\nduction of carbon monoxide gas. Complete combustion of\nthe gas requires, but is not limited to, correct gas pressure\nand gas flow rate, adequate combustion, air, and proper\nventing.\nWARNING\nCarbon monoxide gas is invisible, odorless and\ntoxic.\nExposure to carbon monoxide gas can cause personal inju-\nry and even death to all occupants, including pets. Any item\nthat is powered by or gives off heat from a combustion pro-\ncess (including lawn mowers, automobiles, and fireplaces)\nhas the potential to produce carbon monoxide gas. Because\nof this, Lennox recommends the use of a carbon monox-\nide detector in your home, even if you do not own gas\nappliances. Reliable detectors are available at reasonable\nretail prices. Contact your Lennox dealer for more details\nabout this investment in your safety.\nYour furnace is designed to meet standards set by nation-\nal agencies, and to operate safely when properly installed\nand maintained. However, the unit’s performance can be\ngreatly impacted by the individual installation and the op-\nerating environment. It is your responsibility to ensure that\nthis appliance is maintained. Proper maintenance is criti-\ncal for your safety and the satisfactory operation of the\nproduct. Lennox strongly recommends annual in-\nspection and maintenance of this appliance. Contact\nyour Lennox dealer for an inspection by a qualified service\ntechnician.\nLighting Information & Operation\nWARNING\nIf you do not follow these instructions exactly, a fire\nor explosion may result causing property damage,\npersonal injury or death.\nBEFORE LIGHTING smell all around the appliance area\nfor gas.

This is\nachieved by the means of the flammable vapour sensor.\nProperly installed and maintained, it will provide years of\ntrouble free service.\nThis gas-fired water heater has been developed to produce\npotable hot water for normal residential demands and may\nalso be used in combination with space heating applica-\ntions. Any deviation from these applications could affect\nyour warranty.\nUser Responsibilities\nThis manual has been prepared to acquaint you with the\ninstallation, operation and maintenance of your gas fired\nwater heater and provide important safety information in\nthese areas. It is your responsibility to ensure that your\nwater heater is properly installed and cared for.\nFAILURE TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THIS\nMANUAL MAY RESULT IN SERIOUS BODILY INJURY\nAND/OR PROPERTY DAMAGE. THOROUGHLY READ\nAND UNDERSTAND ALL INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE YOU\nATTEMPT TO INSTALL, OPERATE OR MAINTAIN THIS\nHEATER.\nInstallation and service requires trade knowledge in the\nareas of plumbing, electricity, venting, air supply and gas\nsupply. If you lack these skills or have difficulty understand-\ning these instructions, you should not proceed. Enlist the\nhelp of a qualified service technician to install this water\nheater.\nExamples of qualified service technicians include those\ntrained in the plumbing and heating industry, local gas utili-\nty personnel or an authorized service person.\nService to the Power Vent System should only be per-\nformed by a qualified service technician.\nThe manufacturer and seller of this water heater will not\nassume any liability for any property damage, personal\ninjury or death resulting from improper sizing, installation or\nfailure to comply with these instructions.\nThe warranty on this water heater is in effect only when the\nwater heater is installed and operated in accordance with\nthese instructions. A data plate identifying your water heater\ncan be found above the gas control/thermostat. When refer-\nring to your water heater, always have the information listed\non the data plate readily available.\nProtect your warranty: Regularly service your water\nheater as directed in the \"Maintenance\" section of this man-\nual.\nRetain your original receipt as proof of purchase.\nDo not discard this manual. You or future users of this\nwater heater will need it for reference.\nII) SAFETY\nThis water heater is design-certified by CSA International as\na Category I, non-direct vented water heater that takes its\ncombustion air either from the installation area or from air\nducted to the unit from the outside.\nIn addition to the installation instructions found in this man-\nual, the water heater must be installed in accordance with\nall local and provincial or state codes or, in the absence of\nsuch, with the latest editions of the following specifications.\nFor Installations in Canada:\n\"Natural Gas and Propane Installation Code\" CAN/CSA-\nB149.1 and \"Canadian Electrical Code (CAN/CSA\nC22.1), Part I\" available from:\nCanadian Standards Association,\n5060 Spectrum Way,\nMississauga, Ontario, Canada\nL4W 5N6\nFor Installations in the United States:\n\"National Fuel Gas Code\" ANSI Z223.1 (NFPA 54) and\n\"National Electrical Code\" (NFPA 70)\" available from:\nAmerican National Standards Institute,\n25 West 43rd Street,\nNew York, NY 10036\nMassachusetts code requires this water heater to be\ninstalled in accordance with Massachusetts Plumbing and\nFuel Gas Code 248 CMR Section 2.00 and 5.00.\nCheck your phone listings for the local authorities having\njurisdiction over your installation.\nSafety Warning (Flammable Vapours)\nThere is a risk of property damage, personal injury or death\nfrom the by-products of combustion (e.g., flue gases), in\nusing fuel-burning appliances such as water heaters. Areas\nthat may not be suitable for water heater installation include\nthose where flammable liquids, gasoline, solvents, adhe-\nsives etc. are stored, or where engine-driven equipment or\nvehicles are stored, operated or repaired. These, and simi-\nlar products, should not be stored or used near the water\nheater or air intake. Due to the nature of air movement,\nflammable vapours can be carried some distance from the\npoint of storage. The gas-fired water heater igniter or burn-\ner flame can ignite these vapours causing a flashback, fire\nor explosion, which may result in severe property damage,\nserious personal injury or death. If flammable liquids or\nvapours have spilled or leaked in the area of the water\nheater, leave the area immediately and call the fire depart-\nment from a neighbor's home. Do not attempt to clean the\nspill until all ignition sources have been extinguished.\nSafety Warning (Scalding)\nHot water produced by this appliance can cause severe\nburns due to scalding. The hazard is increased for young\nchildren, the aged or the disabled when water temperatures\nexceed 52°C (125°F). Use tempering valves, also known as\nmixing valves, in the hot-water system to reduce the risk of\nscalding at point-of-use such as lavatories, sinks and\nbathing facilities (see Figure 17). Such precautions must be\nfollowed when",

Installation and service must\nbe performed by a licensed professional installer (or\nequivalent), service agency or the gas supplier.\nCAUTION\nAs with any mechanical equipment, personal injury\ncan result from contact with sharp sheet metal\nedges. Be careful when you handle this equipment.\nG40UH(X) units are CSA International certified to ANSI\nZ21.47 and CSA 2.3 standards.\nIn the USA, installation of gas furnaces must conform with lo-\ncal building codes. In the absence of local codes, units must\nbe installed according to the current National Fuel Gas Code\n(ANSI-Z223.1). The National Fuel Gas Code is available\nfrom the following address:\nAmerican National Standards Institute, Inc.\n11 West 42nd Street\nNew York, NY 10036\nIn Canada, installation must conform with current CSA\nB149 Natural Gas and Propane Installation Codes, local\nplumbing or waste water codes and other applicable local\ncodes.\nAdequate clearance must be made around the air open-\nings into the vestibule area. In order to ensure proper unit\noperation, combustion and ventilation air supply must be\nprovided according to the current National Fuel Gas Code\nor CSA B149 standards.\nVent installations must be consistent with the venting\ntables (in this instruction) and applicable provisions of local\nbuilding codes.\nThis furnace is CSA International certified for installation\nclearances to combustible material as listed on the unit\nnameplate and in the tables in figures 6 and 11. Accessibility\nand service clearances must take precedence over fire\nprotection clearances.\nNOTE − For installation on combustible floors, the furnace\nshall not be installed directly on carpeting, tile, or other\ncombustible material other than wood flooring.\nFor installation in a residential garage, the furnace must\nbe installed so that the burner(s) and the ignition source\nare located no less than 18 inches (457 mm) above the\nfloor. The furnace must be located or protected to avoid\nphysical damage by vehicles. When a furnace is installed\nin a public garage, hangar, or other building that has a haz-\nardous atmosphere, the furnace must be installed accord-\ning to recommended good practice requirements and cur-\nrent National Fuel Gas Code or CSA B149 standards.\nNOTE − Furnace must be adjusted to obtain a temperature\nrise within the range specified on the unit nameplate. Failure\nto do so may cause erratic limit operation and premature heat\nexchanger failure.\nThis G40UH(X) furnace must be installed so that its electri-\ncal components are protected from water.\nWhen this furnace is used with cooling units, it shall be\ninstalled in parallel with, or on the upstream side of, cooling\nunits to avoid condensation in the heating compartment.\nWith a parallel flow arrangement, a damper (or other means\nto control the flow of air) must adequately prevent chilled air\nfrom entering the furnace. If the damper is manually oper-\nated, it must be equipped to prevent operation of either the\nheating or the cooling unit, unless it is in the full HEAT or\nCOOL setting.\nWhen installed, this fu",

The pilot flame heats the tip of the\nthermocouple, producing a temperature differential between it\nand the base. This temperature difference generates a small\namount of DC power, measured in millivolts.\nQ335 Thermocouple is a quick dropout thermocouple used in\nconjunction with the Q313 Thermopile Generator in the Q382\nPilot Burner. The flame in the pilot burner is directed toward\nthe thermocouple and the thermopile. As long as pilot flame is\npresent, the millivolt output from the thermocouple keeps the\nsafety valve in the gas control open, allowing the main gas to\nflow to the appliance on demand. The millivolt output from the\nthermopile energizes the operator in the valve on demand.\nQ313 Thermopile Generator contains multiple thermocouples\nconnected in series to increase the millivoltage output.

This unit details four areas where significant requirements for the installation, operation, and testing of large piping and tubing systems should be understood by the gas technician/fitter .\nUnit 12-Controls: Fundamentals\nObjectives \nAt the end of this unit you will be able to:\nDescribe control concepts and components\nExplain the basic control system\nDescribe operating controllers\nDescribe combustion and safety controls\nDescribe ignition control modules\nDescribe valves and regulators\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nOverview:\nPurpose: \nA gas technician/fitter will regularly encounter numerous types of controls. The fundamentals of the operation of these controls are also numerous. Knowing how controls work, where they are applied, and how they interact with other controls is important to understanding overall systems.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nObjectives:\n At the end of this chapter you will be able to: \n•\tDescribe control concepts and components.\n•\tExplain the basic control system.\n•\tDescribe operating controllers.\n•\tDescribe limit and safety controllers.\n•\tDescribe combustion and safety controls.\n•\tDescribe ignition control modules.\n•\tDescribe valves and regulators.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nControl Concepts and Components:\n\tControl systems used in the gas industry use the physical characteristics of solids, liquids, and gases to expand and contract, and to conduct or resist electricity as a means of regulating the burner system. For example, physical characteristics associated with the expansion of solids and liquids, electromagnetism, the thermoelectric effect, and electricity are all used in varying capacities. \nEach of the founding principles is discussed below, with examples of controls that operate on these principles.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nThermal Expansion of Solids:\n\tMetals expand when heated and contract when cooled. The principle of the thermal expansion of solids is used for several control devices that regulate temperature change. \nTemperature Disc: \nThe temperature snap disc (trademark Klixon) responds to temperature changes by moving from a concave to convex shape, touching electrical contacts and completing a circuit. The temperature disc can be used in the thermal relay.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nBi-Metallic Strip:\n\tThe bimetallic strip operates on the fact that not all metals expand at the same rate. This device uses the warping action created when two dissimilar metals having different coefficients of expansion are welded together at one end and exposed to temperature change. Since one end of the bimetallic strip is anchored solidly, the free end moves up or down with an increase or decrease in temperature. The resulting curling or bending is used to control the opening or closing of electrical contacts.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nElectrical Heating of a Resistive Element:\nMost materials conduct electrical current to some degree and heat up as a result. The amount of heat created depends on the current flow through the resistor and the material's electrical resistance. \nThe functions of the bimetallic strip can be tied in with a change in voltage by wrapping a heat resistive wire around the strip. When voltage is applied, the current drawn by the wire will create heat, causing the bimetal to warp and open/close electrical contacts.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nRod and Tube:\n\tThe rod and tube control device also works on the principle that some metals expand more quickly than others. In this control device the sensing portion of the valve is constructed of copper tube that has a high expansion/ contraction rate. The copper tube encases an in var rod, a metal alloy with a low expansion/ contraction rate. The invar rod and copper tube are welded together at the far end so the expansion and contraction of the copper tube effectively moves the invar rod back and forth, opening and closing a switch.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nThermal Expansion of Liquids:\n\tLike solids, liquids expand when heated and contract when cooled. When liquid is sealed in a narrow tube ( called a capillary) the force created by the liquid expanding within the capillary is used to operate an electrical switch or control mechanism.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nSealed Bellows:\n\tIn the sealed bellows control device, liquid inside a bulb at one end of the capillary senses the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere and expands or contracts. At the other end of the capillary an attached bellows reacts to the pressure within the capillary by expanding or contracting. One advantage of the capillary tube is that it allows the bulb to be located remotely from the bellows.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nThe action of the bellows is used to operate:\nA switching device-completing or interrupting an electrical circuit\n• A mechanism that controls the gas valve outlet-modulating the gas supply to the main burner\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nThe liquid in the bulb may be fluid fill or mercury, depending on the temperatures that will be encountered. \nFluid Fill:\nSealed bellows used to operate thermostats may have a temperature limit of 650°F (343°C) and usually contain a fluid similar to a light oil. The expansion or contraction of this type of fill is quite linear and gives a smooth operation of the thermostat. \nAlways check the manufacturer's specification for recommended temperature and pressure limits.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nMercury: \nFor high temperatures, such as 3000°F (1648°C) reached in pilot safety controls, the bulb must be filled with mercury. The expansion of the mercury is smooth up to approximately 650°F (343°C), at which point the mercury vapourizes (boils). With vapourization, a rapid expansion takes place, giving the control \"snap action.\" Similarly, upon cooling, there is a rapid contraction as the vapour condenses to a liquid.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nElectromagnetism:\n\tWhen an electrical current is passed through a metal rod (called a conductor), a magnetic field surrounds the conductor. This principle has been put to use in creating the electromagnet, which forms the basis for the solenoid used in many control devices. Most electrical control devices use solenoids to produce physical motion.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nSolenoids:\nA solenoid is an electromagnetic device that creates a magnetic field around an actuating component converting electrical energy to a mechanical force. \nWhen current runs through the solenoid coil it creates a magnetic force inside the space it surrounds. A piece of iron, called an armature, becomes a temporary magnet when it is in the magnetic field. If it is partially inside the coil, the temporary magnet will be pulled into the centre of the coil when the circuit is closed. When the circuit is opened, the magnetic field dies, and the armature is free to move to its original position, frequently with the assistance of a small spring return action.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nThermoelectric Effect:\n\tThe thermoelectric effect of producing electricity by heat is used for the thermocouple and thermopile. \nThese sections and devices are covered in detail in the 11 Basic Electricity for Gas Fired Equipment unit.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nThermocouple:\nA thermocouple uses the combined effects of temperature change and electricity. It consists of a bimetallic strip joined at one end (called the hot junction). When the hot junction is heated, a de voltage is generated across to the other two ends of the strips (the cold junction). \nThe thermocouple is used to prove the pilot flame; if it goes out, the thermocouple prevents the main gas valve from opening.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nThe magnitude of the voltage across to the cold junction depends on the: \nTwo materials of the bimetallic strip\nTemperature difference between the hot and cold junctions\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nThermopile:\nThe output of a single thermocouple is very small: 20 to 30 millivolts (1000 millivolts= 1 volt). By placing a number of single thermocouples in series electrically, a device known as a thermopile can be created that generates hundreds of millivolts.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nWheatstone Bridge Principle:\nElectrical circuitry has used resistors (R) in many applications to control the flow of current in systems for many years. However, most resistors are now made using semi-conductors as described in the Semi-conductors and Solid State Electronics section. The Wheatstone bridge circuit is used in both electrical-mechanical and electronic control systems.\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nThe circuit shown is based on the Wheatstone bridge principle. The principle states that when the ratio of Rl to R2 is the same as the ratio of R3 to R4, the circuit is in balance (i.e., there is no current flow between A and B).\nUnit 12-Fundamentals of Controls\nElectronic Balancing Application:\nThe Wheatstone bridge principle can be used in control devices and is used in some electronic thermostat controls for water heaters. As long as a state of balance is maintained in the circuit there will be no current flow between points A and B. When the thermostat dial (R3) is set to a given temperature, an imbalance occurs that allows current to flow between A and B. This current is used to energize a relay, which in turn energizes the ignition control module. The circuit remains energized until the resistance of the sensor (R4) changes sufficiently to rebalance the ratio between Ri/R2 and R3/R4. At",

\n \nNotes: \nStatic pressure is measured to interpret airflow in a system.  Generally, manufacturers’ engineering manuals rate \nairflow in furnaces and air handlers based on “Total External Static Pressure” (TESP).  A typical furnace is designed \nto operate around .50 in. w.c.. If there is more than .50 inches TESP, the fan  may not be moving the required air \nflow.  You should always check the fan capacity of the furnaces and air handlers you select carefully, the pressure \ncapacities will range from .05‐ to 1.0 in.   \nStatic Pressure Testing:  \nTo determine Total External Static Pressure of a furnace you first measure the supply (+) pressure near the \ndischarge of the unit, between the furnace and the coil. (Test Point “C”)  Next, you measure the return (‐) \npressure near the inlet of the unit, often between the filter and the furnace. . (Test Point “B”)  Then you add the \ntwo pressures together to determine the system’s TESP.  When adding the positive and negative pressures \ntogether ignore the + and – signs. These only indicate the type of pressure measured.  Compare the measured \nTESP to the rated pressure capacity found on the appliance rating plate. \n \n

Testing will show normal and abnormal operating conditions at various points due to air flow restriction.\nNote: Each step must be signed off by the instructor before proceeding to the next question. Skipped sign offs will result in lost marks (2 per). Any damage to the systems components due to negligence or horseplay will result in a mark of zero for the practical.\nFollow all shop safety rules.\nGeneral Airflow Information:\nStatic pressure is measured to interpret airflow in a duct system. Generally, manufacturers engineering manuals rate airflow in furnaces and air handlers based on Total External Static Pressure or TESP. A typical furnace is designed to operate around 0.50 “W.C. If there is more than 0.50 inches TESP, the fan may not be moving the required air flow. You should always carefully check the fan capacity of the furnaces and air handlers you select. The pressure capacities will range from .05 ‐ to 1.0 “W.C.\nStatic Pressure Testing:\nTo determine the TESP of a furnace you first measure the supply (+positive) pressure. This should be near the discharge of the unit, between the furnace and AC coil (test point C). Next, you measure the return (–negative) pressure. This should be near the inlet of the unit, often between the filter and the furnace (test point B). Now take the two pressures and add them together to determine the system’s TESP. When adding the positive and negative pressures together ignore the + and – signs. These only indicate the type of pressure measured. Compare the measured TESP to the rated pressure found on the appliance rating plate or in the manual.\nUsing the diagram above as a guide, attach your manometer to the system and take the required measurements.

Label all wires prior to disconnection when servicing\ncontrols. Wiring errors can cause improper and dangerous operation.\nVerify proper operation after servicing.\nWARNING\nHydrogen gas can be produced in an operating water heater that\nhas not had water drawn from the tank for a long period of time\n(generally two weeks or more). Hydrogen gas is extremely\nflammable. To prevent the possibility of injury under these\nconditions, we recommend the hot water faucet to be open for\nseveral minutes at the kitchen sink before you use any electrical\nappliance which is connected to the hot water system. If\nhydrogen is present, there will be an unusual sound such as air\nescaping through the pipes as hot water begins to flow. Do not\nsmoke or have open flame near the faucet at the time it is open.\nWARNING\nFAILURE TO INSTALL AND MAINTAIN A NEW, LISTED ¾” X ¾”\nTEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE WILL RELEASE\nTHE MANUFACTURER FROM ANY CLAIM THAT MIGHT RESULT\nFROM EXCESSIVE TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURES.\nCAUTION\nIf sweat fittings are to be used DO NOT apply heat to the nipples\non top of the water heater. Sweat the tubing to the adapter\nbefore fitting the adapter to the water connections. It is\nimperative that heat is not applied to the nipples containing a\nplastic liner.\nWARNING\nDO NOT ATTEMPT TO LIGHT ANY GAS APPLIANCE IF YOU ARE\nNOT CERTAIN OF THE FOLLOWING:\n•\nLiquefied petroleum gases/propane gas and natural gas\nhave an odorant added by the gas supplier that aids in the\ndetection of the gas.\n•\nMost people recognize this odor as a “sulfur” or “rotten egg”\nsmell.\n•\nOther conditions, such as “odorant fade” can cause the\nodorant to diminish in intensity, or “fade”, and not be as\nreadily detectable.\n•\nIf you have a diminished sense of smell, or are in any way\nunsure of the presence of gas, immediately contact your gas\nsupplier from a neighbor’s telephone.\nGas detectors are available. Contact your gas supplier, or plumbing\nprofessional, for more information.\nWARNING\nWater heaters are heat producing appliances. To avoid damage\nor injury, do not store materials against the water heater or vent-\nair intake system. Use proper care to avoid unnecessary contact\n(especially by children) with the water heater and vent-air intake\ncomponents. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES MUST\nFLAMMABLE MATERIALS, SUCH AS GASOLINE OR PAINT\nTHINNER BE USED OR STORED IN THE VICINITY OF THIS\nWATER HEATER, VENT-AIR INTAKE SYSTEM OR IN ANY\nLOCATION FROM WHICH FUMES COULD REACH THE\nWATER HEATER OR VENT-AIR INTAKE SYSTEM\nIMPORTANT\nBefore proceeding, please inspect the\nwater heater and its components for\npossible damage. DO NOT install any\nwater heater with damaged\ncomponents. If damage is evident\nthen please contact the supplier where\nthe water heater was purchased or the\nmanufacturer listed on the rating plate\nfor replacement parts.\nDANGER\nDo not store or use gasoline or other flammable,\ncombustible, or corrosive vapors and liquids in\nthe vicinity of this or any other appliance.\n3\n4 \n  PV Series  \n \nIntroduction \nThe new Bradford White RG1PV & RG2PV water heaters are designed to provide reliable performance with \nenhanced standard features. New design features include reliable spark to pilot ignition system, enhanced \ndiagnostics, simplified servicing, quiet operation, additional vent lengths, and Bradford White Defender \nSafety System® (not available on all models). \nSpark to Pilot Ignition System - employing the spark to pilot ignition system promotes reliable and consistent \npilot and main burner ignitions to provide hot water on demand. \nIntegrated Immersion Thermostat/Gas Control Valve with LED - was developed for ease of troubleshooting \nby providing simple diagnostic codes to pinpoint an installation or component performance issue. \nPowerful Blower - will eliminate problems with difficult venting situations. \nQuiet and Cool Blower Operation - blower noise is significantly reduced for both interior and exterior \nenvironments. Cooler operation increases blower life by reducing bearing wear and noise. \nConcealed Wiring Connections – Provide simple error free wiring. \nIncreased Vent Lengths - increased venting performance is achieved while maintaining Energy Factor & \nFHR (not available on all models) performance. \nThe RG1PV & RG2PV water heaters use a combustion system where flue gases are combined with dilution \nair to reduce the flue gas temperature in the blower.  The diluted flue gases are evacuated to the exterior \nthrough low temperature vent materials. The gas control maintains water temperature, ignition sequence \nand regulates gas flow. A safety circuit consisting of a pressure switch and blower temperature switch \nverifies proper conditions exist for safe and reliable operation. If a situation outside of normal operating \nparameters exists, the gas control diagnostic LED will flash a code to positively identify an operational issue. \nThis service manual is designed to facilitate problem diagnosis and enhance service efficiency. \nPlease read the service manual completely before attempting service on this new series of power vent \nmodels. \nHow the Safety System Works \nDuring normal operation, air for combustion is drawn into the water heater through the opening in the jacket. \nThis air travels down and around the combustion chamber and enters through holes in the very bottom of the \ncorrosion-resistant combustion chamber. The air then travels up through the oriented flame arrestor plate \nlouvers, where the velocity of air is increased, and its direction altered. The air then mixes in a normal \nmanner with supplied gas and is efficiently combusted, producing low NOx emissions. \nIn the unlikely event trace amounts of fla",

Special steps can be required to\nprevent nuisance shutdowns and control failure due to\nfrequent cycling, severe environmental conditions related\nto moisture, corrosive chemicals, dust or excessive heat.\nThese applications require Honeywell Home and\nBuilding Control Engineering review; contact your\nHoneywell Sales Representative for assistance.\nReview the following conditions that can apply to your\nspecific installation and take the precautionary steps\nsuggested.\nFrequent Cycling\nThese controls are designed for use on appliances that\ntypically cycle three to four times an hour only during the\nheating season. In year-round applications with greater\ncycling rates, the control can wear out more quickly;\nperform a monthly checkout.\nWater or Steam Cleaning\nIf a module or gas control gets wet, replace it. If the\nappliance is likely to be cleaned with water or steam,\nprotect (cover) the controls and wiring from water or\nsteam flow. Mount the controls high enough above the\nbottom of the cabinet so they do not get wet during\nnormal cleaning procedures. Use a NEMA 4 enclosure\nfor the ignition module; see the Electronic Ignition\nService Manual, form 70-6604.\nHigh Humidity or Dripping Water\nDripping water can cause the module to fail. Never install\nan appliance where water can drip on the controls.\nIn addition, high ambient humidity can cause the gas\ncontrol to corrode and fail.\nIf the appliance is in a humid atmosphere, make sure air\ncirculation around the controls is adequate to prevent\ncondensation. Also, regularly check out the system. A\nNEMA 4 enclosure is recommended for the ignition\nmodule; see the Electronic Ignition Service Manual,\nform 70-6604.\nCorrosive Chemicals\nCorrosive chemicals can attack the module and gas\ncontrol, eventually causing a failure. If chemicals are\nused for routine cleaning, make sure they do not reach\nthe controls. Where chemicals are suspended in air, as\nin some industrial or agricultural applications, use a\nNEMA 4 enclosure for the ignition module; see the\nElectronic Ignition Service Manual, form 70-6604.\nDust or Grease Accumulation\nHeavy accumulations of dust or grease can cause\ncontrols to malfunction. Where dust or grease can be a\nproblem, provide covers for the module and the gas\ncontrol to limit contamination. A NEMA 4 enclosure is\nrecommended for the ignition module; see the Electronic\nIgnition Service Manual, form 70-6604.\nHeat\nExcessively high temperatures can damage controls.\nMake sure the maximum ambient temperature at the\ncontrol does not exceed the rating of the control. If the\nappliance operates at very high temperatures, use\ninsulation, shielding, and air circulation, as necessary, to\nprotect the controls. Proper insulation or shielding should\nbe provided by the appliance manufacturer; verify proper\nair circulation is maintained when the appliance is\ninstalled.\nINSTALLATION\nWhen Installing this Ignition System…\n1. Read these instructions carefully. Failure to follow\nthem could damage the components or cause a\nhazardous condition.\n2. Check the ratings given in the instructions and on\nthe components to make sure they are suitable for\nyour application.\n3. Installer must be a trained, experienced service\ntechnician.\n4. After installation is complete, check out component\noperation as provided in these instructions.\nWARNING\nFIRE OR EXPLOSION HAZARD\nCAN CAUSE PROPERTY DAMAGE,\nSEVERE INJURY, OR DEATH.\n1.\nIf the ignition module gets wet, it can\nmalfunction, leading to the accumulation of\nexplosive gas.\n•\nNever install where water can flood, ",

Special steps may be required to prevent\nnuisance shutdowns and control failure due to frequent\ncycling, severe environmental conditions related to\nmoisture, corrosive chemicals, dust or excessive heat.\nThese applications require Honeywell Home and Building\nControl Engineering review; contact your Honeywell Sales\nRepresentative for assistance.\nReview the following conditions that can apply to your\nspecific installation and take the precautionary steps\nsuggested.\nFrequent Cycling\nThis control is designed for use on appliances that typically\ncycle three to four times an hour only during the heating\nseason. In year-around applications and applications with\ngreater cycling rates, the control can wear out more\nquickly. Perform a monthly checkout as described in this\ninstruction manual.\nWater or Steam Cleaning\nIf a control gets wet, replace it. If the appliance is likely to\nbe cleaned with water or steam, protect (cover) the control\nand wiring from water or steam flow. Mount the control\nhigh enough above the bottom of the cabinet so it does not\nget wet during normal cleaning procedures.\nHigh Humidity or Dripping Water\nDripping water can cause the control to fail. Never install\nan appliance where water can drip on the control. In\naddition, high ambient humidity can cause the control to\ncorrode and fail. If the appliance is in a humid atmosphere,\nmake sure air circulation around the control is adequate to\nprevent condensation. Also, regularly check out the\nsystem as described in this instruction manual.\nCorrosive Chemicals\nCorrosive chemicals can attack the control, eventually\ncausing a failure. If chemicals are used for routine\ncleaning, avoid contact with the control. Where chemicals\nare suspended in air, as in some industrial or agricultural\napplications, protect the control in an enclosure.\nDust or Grease Accumulation\nHeavy accumulations of dust or grease can cause the\ncontrol to malfunction. Where dust or grease can be a\nproblem, provide covers for the control to limit contamina-\ntion.\nHeat\nExcessively high temperatures can damage the control.\nMake sure the maximum ambient temperature at the\ncontrol does not exceed the control rating. If the appliance\noperates at very high temperatures, use insulation,\nshielding, and air circulation, as necessary, to protect the\ncontrol. The appliance manufacturer should provide proper\ninsulation or shielding; verify proper air circulation is\nmaintained when the appliance is installed.\n69-1004—2\n4\nSV9401/SV9402/SV9403, SV9501/SV9502/SV9503, SV9601/SV9602 SMARTVALVE™\nINSTALLATION\nWhen Installing this Product…\n1.

When room thermostat calls for heat, the control module starts the \nsystem circulator and inducer.\nThe control module runs the inducer long enough to purge the boiler flue passages, then opens the pilot valve and activates \npilot ignition spark.\nFor natural gas, the control module allows up to 15 seconds to establish pilot flame. If flame is not sensed within 15 seconds, \nthe control module will turn off the gas valve, flash the Flame light, and then enter a 15-second postpurge. The control module \nwill then start a new cycle. This will continue indefinitely until pilot flame is established or power is interrupted. Once pilot \nflame is proven, the control module opens the gas valve to allow main burner flame.\nWhen the room thermostat is satisfied, the control module turns off the gas valve, operates the inducer for a 15-second \npostpurge and waits for the next heat call.\nThe control module indicator lights show normal sequence when the lights are on steady. When a problem occurs, the control \nmodule flashes combinations of lights to indicate the most likely reason for the problem (see page 49).\n② \nTransformer\nThe control transformer reduces line voltage to 24 volts for the gas valve and limit circuit.\n③ \nInducer\nThe inducer pulls flue gases through the boiler, causing air to be pulled in through the boiler air openings. The inducer pushes \nthe flue gases through the vent pipe as well.\n④ \nAir pressure switch\nThe air pressure switch signals the control module, telling the control module whether the inducer is working correctly or \nthe vent is blocked.\n⑤   Water temperature sensor \nThe water temperature sensor provides a signal to the control module to turn off the gas valve if the temperature in the boiler \ngoes above its setting or if a low water condition is sensed. (The circulator will continue to run as long as there is a call for heat.)\n⑥ \nBoiler circulator\nThe boiler circulator circulates water through the external (system) piping. The circulator is shipped loose, and can be mounted \non either the boiler supply or return piping. The factory-installed circulator wiring harness provides ample length for either \nlocation. NOTE — The control module provides a pump exercising routine. If the boiler is not operated for 30 days, the \ncontrol module will power the circulator for 30 seconds, then turn off.\na supply to system\nb return from system\nc stainless steel burners\nd flue outlet\ne gas valve\nf pressure/temperature gauge\ng relief valve\nh air vent connection\ni flame rollout thermal fuse element \n(TFE)\nj \nburner shield\nk pilot burner and bracket\nl \ngas manifold\nm cast iron boiler sections\nn flue collector\no junction box\nOther boiler components:\nPart Number 550-142-902/1016\nCGi GAS-FIRED WATER BOILER — SERIES 3 — Boiler Manual\n3\nCGi  Gas-Fired Induced-Draft Water Boiler\nPart Number 550-142-902/1016\nCGi GAS-FIRED WATER BOILER — SERIES 3 — Boiler Manual\n4\nContents\n        How it works . . . ................................................. 2\n \nHazard definitions ............................................... 4\n \nPlease read before proceeding ............................ 5\n  1 \nPrepare boiler location ...................................6–11\n  2 \nPrepare boiler ...............................................12–13\n  3 \nVenting .........................................................14-19\n  4 \nWater piping .................................................20-29\n  5 \nGas piping ......................................................... 30\n  6 \nField wiring ....................................................... 31\n  7 \nStart-up ........................................................32-35\n  8 \nCheck-out procedure — checklist ...................... 36\n  9 \nDepartment of Energy Compliance  ................... 37\n9a \nOperation .....................................................38-43\n10 \nService and maintenance .............................44-48\n11 \nTroubleshooting ............................................49-58\n12 \nReplacement parts .......................................60-66\n13 \nDimensions and ratings ................................67-68\n        Handling ceramic fiber and fiberglass materials .............. 69\nHazard definitions\nThe following defined terms are used throughout this manual to bring attention to the presence of hazards of various \nrisk levels or to important information concerning the life of the product.\n \nIndicates presence of hazards that will cause severe personal injury, death or substantial property \ndamage.\n \nIndicates presence of hazards that can cause severe personal injury, death or substantial property \ndamage.\n \nIndicates presence of hazards that will or can cause minor personal injury or property damage.\nIndicates special instructions on installation, operation or maintenance that are important but \nnot related to personal injury or property damage.\nPart Number 550-142-902/1016\nCGi GAS-FIRED WATER BOILER — SERIES 3 — Boiler Manual\n5\nPlease read before proceeding\nInstaller\n Read all instructions before installing. Fol-\nlow all instructions in proper order to prevent \npersonal injury or death.\n• \nConsider piping and installation when determining boiler \nlocation.\n• \nAny claims for damage or shortage in shipment must be \nfiled immediately against the transportation company by the \nconsignee.\nUser\n• \nThis manual is for use only by your qualified heating \ninstaller/service technician.\n• \nPlease refer to the User’s Information Manual for your refer-\nence.\n• \nWe recommend regular service by a qualified service \ntechnician, at least annually.\n The boiler contains ceramic fiber and fiberglass materials. Use care when handling these materials per instructions on \nof this manual. Failure to comply could result in severe personal injury.\n When calling or writing about the boiler— Please have the boiler model number from the boiler rating label and the \nCP number from the boiler jacket. You may list the CP number in the space provided on the Installation and service \ncertificate found on page 36.\nother potential ignition source, a fire can develop. In order to \nprevent potential severe personal injury, death or substantial \nproperty damage from fire and/or structural damage:\n• \nNever store glycol of any kind near the boiler or any po-\ntential ignition source.\n• \nMonitor and inspect the system and boiler regularly for \nleakage. Repair any leaks immediately to prevent possible \naccumulation of glycol.\n• \nNever use automotive antifreeze or ethylene glycol in the \nsystem. Using these glycols can lead to hazardous leakage \nof glycol in the boiler system. \nSaltwater Damage —   The exposure of boiler components \nto saltwater can have both immediate and long-term effects. \nWhile the immediate effects of saltwater damage are similar \nto those of freshwater (shorting out of electrical components, \nwashing out of critical lubricants, etc.), the salt and other con-\ntaminants left behind can lead to longer term issues after the \nwater is gone due to the conductive and corrosive nature of the \nsalt residue. Therefore, Weil‑McLain equipment contaminated \nwith saltwater or polluted water will no longer be covered under \nwarranty and should be replaced.\nElectrical Damage — If any electrical component or wir-\ning came into contact with water, or was suspected to have \ncome into contact with water, replace the boiler with a new \nWeil‑McLain boiler.\nFrozen Water Damage Hazard\nResidences or buildings that are unattended in severely cold \nweather, boiler system components failures, power outages, or \nother electrical system failures could result in frozen plumbing \nand water damage in a matter of hours. For your protection, \ntake preventative actions such as having a security system \ninstalled that operates during power outages, senses low tem-\nperature, and initiates an effective action. Consult with your \nboiler contractor or a home security agency.\nWhen servicing boiler —\n• \nTo avoid electric shock, disconnect electrical supply before \nperforming maintenance.\n• \nTo avoid severe burns, allow boiler to cool before perform-\ning maintenance.\nBoiler operation —\n• \nDo not block flow of combustion or ventilation air to boiler.\n• \nShould overheating occur or gas supply fail to shut off, do \nnot turn off or disconnect electrical supply to circulator. \nInstead, shut off the gas supply at a location external to the \nappliance.\n• \nDo not use this boiler if any part has been under water. \nImmediately call a qualified service technician to inspect \nthe boiler and to replace any part of the control system and \nany gas control that has been under water.\nBoiler water —\n• \nDo not use petroleum‑based cleaning or sealing com-\npounds in boiler system. Water seal deterioration will \noccur, causing leakage between sections. This can result \nin substantial property damage.\n• \nDo not use “homemade cures” or “boiler patent medicines”. \nSerious damage to boiler, personnel and/or property may \nresult.\n• \nContinual fresh mak",

Testing will show normal and abnormal operating conditions at various points due to air flow restriction.\nNote: Each step must be signed off by the instructor before proceeding to the next question. Skipped sign offs will result in lost marks (2 per). Any damage to the systems components due to negligence or horseplay will result in a mark of zero for the practical.\nFollow all shop safety rules.\nGeneral Airflow Information:\nStatic pressure is measured to interpret airflow in a duct system. Generally, manufacturers engineering manuals rate airflow in furnaces and air handlers based on Total External Static Pressure or TESP. A typical furnace is designed to operate around 0.50 “W.C. If there is more than 0.50 inches TESP, the fan may not be moving the required air flow. You should always carefully check the fan capacity of the furnaces and air handlers you select. The pressure capacities will range from .05 ‐ to 1.0 “W.C.\nStatic Pressure Testing:\nTo determine the TESP of a furnace you first measure the supply (+positive) pressure. This should be near the discharge of the unit, between the furnace and AC coil (test point C). Next, you measure the return (–negative) pressure. This should be near the inlet of the unit, often between the filter and the furnace (test point B). Now take the two pressures and add them together to determine the system’s TESP. When adding the positive and negative pressures together ignore the + and – signs. These only indicate the type of pressure measured. Compare the measured TESP to the rated pressure found on the appliance rating plate or in the manual.\nUsing the diagram above as a guide, attach your manometer to the system and take the required measurements. For any test points that are unclear, verify with the instructor.

Testing will show normal and abnormal operating conditions at various points due to air flow restriction.\nNote: Each step must be signed off by the instructor before proceeding to the next question. Skipped sign offs will result in lost marks (2 per). Any damage to the systems components due to negligence or horseplay will result in a mark of zero for the practical.\nFollow all shop safety rules.\nGeneral Airflow Information:\nStatic pressure is measured to interpret airflow in a duct system. Generally, manufacturers engineering manuals rate airflow in furnaces and air handlers based on Total External Static Pressure or TESP. A typical furnace is designed to operate around 0.50 “W.C. If there is more than 0.50 inches TESP, the fan may not be moving the required air flow. You should always carefully check the fan capacity of the furnaces and air handlers you select. The pressure capacities will range from .05 ‐ to 1.0 “W.C.\nStatic Pressure Testing:\nTo determine the TESP of a furnace you first measure the supply (+positive) pressure. This should be near the discharge of the unit, between the furnace and AC coil (test point C). Next, you measure the return (–negative) pressure. This should be near the inlet of the unit, often between the filter and the furnace (test point B). Now take the two pressures and add them together to determine the system’s TESP. When adding the positive and negative pressures together ignore the + and – signs. These only indicate the type of pressure measured. Compare the measured TESP to the rated pressure found on the appliance rating plate or in the manual.\nUsing the diagram above as a guide, attach your manometer to the system and take the required measurements. For any test points that are unclear, verify with the instructor.

Coil pressure drop can be compared to the manufacturer’s rated coil pressure drop at current airflow to determine if coil is clean.

Coil resistance should be around 2.25 ohms. If not, replace the valve.\nThe system resistance from the remote switch or thermostat and lead wires should not exceed 1.7 ohms. If greater, reduce the resistance by reducing the thermostat run length, use a larger gauge wire, or replace the thermostat.\nWith the pilostat knob turned to “Pilot” and the thermostat open, push down the pilot valve button and ignite the pilot flame with the piezo ignitor. There should be a minimum of 325 mV. If not, inspect the position of the thermopile in the flame and the cleanliness of thermopile. If both are adequate, replace the thermopile.\nWith the pilostat knob left in the “Pilot” position and pilot still burning, close the thermostat contacts. The thermopile should provide at least 100 mV. If not, replace the thermopile. If the input is at least 100 mV, the valve operator will make an audible click inside the valve when it engages. If the valve does not make a sound, replace it.\nIf you are unsure how to make the readings, ASK!
