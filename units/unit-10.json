As a student, you must be aware of the code \nrequirements concerning approved types of piping and tubing, as well as \napplicable joining methods. Pipe sizes, locations, and pressures are all \nfactors that you must consider before installing a piping or tubing \nsystem.\nMK\nby Mike Kapin\nCreated\nCopywrite 2025\nLearning Objectives\nDescribe Code \nRequirements\nUnderstand the Code \nrequirements for industrial \nand commercial \napplications\nDescribe Joining \nMethods\nLearn the joining methods \nthat may be used for gas \npiping and tubing systems\nApply Knowledge\nApply code requirements and joining methods in practical \ninstallation scenarios\nKey Terminology\nTerm\nDefinition\nBonding\nPermanent joining of metallic \nparts to form an electrically \nconductive path that ensures \nelectrical continuity and the \ncapacity to safely conduct any \ncurrent likely to be imposed\nGrounding\nIntentional connection of a \ncurrent-carrying conductor to \nground (earth)\nUnderstanding these terms is essential for ensuring safe gas piping \ninstallations that comply with both gas and electrical codes.\nCommercial vs. Residential Code Requirements\nCommercial/Industrial\n•\nHigher allowable pressures\n•\nMore stringent pressure testing\n•\nSpecific underground piping requirements\n•\nMandatory identification\n•\nMultiple shut-off valve requirements\n•\nSpecial commercial cooking appliance provisions\nResidential\n•\nLower maximum allowable pressures\n•\nSimpler pressure testing procedures\n•\nLess complex underground requirements\n•\nFewer identification requirements\n•\nBasic shut-off valve provisions\n•\nStandard appliance connection methods\nAllowable Pressures\nCSA B149.1 specifies maximum allowable gas pressure for various building types in Clause 5.1 Delivery Pressure. Gas pressures in supply mains (natural gas) and from storage containers (propane) are generally \nhigher than the safe operating pressures of connected appliances. As a result, you must control gas pressures to fall within an appropriate range, depending on the operating characteristics of installed \nappliances.\nPressure Testing Requirements\nVisual Inspection\nDuring installation of piping and tubing and before pressure testing, visually \ninspect piping and tubing for cuts, abrasions and other defects that may cause \nleaking or failure of the system when under pressure.\nFirst Pressure Test\nPerformed before appliance installation. Isolate the piping system, cap all open \nends, insert a pressure gauge, and pressurize with air or inert gas to the specified \ntest pressure.\nLeak Detection\nIf pressure drops, locate leaks using a liquid solution (soap test).

As a student, you must be aware of the code requirements concerning approved types of piping and tubing, as well as applicable joining methods. Pipe sizes, locations, and pressures are all factors that you must consider before installing a piping or tubing system.\nMK\nby Mike Kapin\nCreated\nCopywrite 2025\nLearning Objectives\nDescribe Code Requirements\nUnderstand the Code requirements for industrial and commercial applications\nDescribe Joining Methods\nLearn the joining methods that may be used for gas piping and tubing systems\nApply Knowledge\nApply code requirements and joining methods in practical installation scenarios\nKey Terminology\nTerm\nDefinition\nBonding\nPermanent joining of metallic parts to form an electrically conductive path that ensures electrical continuity and the capacity to safely conduct any current likely to be imposed\nGrounding\nIntentional connection of a current-carrying conductor to ground (earth)\nUnderstanding these terms is essential for ensuring safe gas piping installations that comply with both gas and electrical codes.\nCommercial vs. Residential Code Requirements\nCommercial/Industrial\nHigher allowable pressures\nMore stringent pressure testing\nSpecific underground piping requirements\nMandatory identification\nMultiple shut-off valve requirements\nSpecial commercial cooking appliance provisions\nResidential\nLower maximum allowable pressures\nSimpler pressure testing procedures\nLess complex underground requirements\nFewer identification requirements\nBasic shut-off valve provisions\nStandard appliance connection methods\nAllowable Pressures\nCSA B149.1 specifies maximum allowable gas pressure for various building types in Clause 5.1 Delivery Pressure. Gas pressures in supply mains (natural gas) and from storage containers (propane) are generally higher than the safe operating pressures of connected appliances. As a result, you must control gas pressures to fall within an appropriate range, depending on the operating characteristics of installed appliances.\nPressure Testing Requirements\nVisual Inspection\nDuring installation of piping and tubing and before pressure testing, visually inspect piping and tubing for cuts, abrasions and other defects that may cause leaking or failure of the system when under pressure.\nFirst Pressure Test\nPerformed before appliance installation. Isolate the piping system, cap all open ends, insert a pressure gauge, and pressurize with air or inert gas to the specified test pressure.\nLeak Detection\nIf pressure drops, locate leaks using a liquid solution (soap test). Wipe each joint with leak detector solution and look for bubbles forming at the source of the leak.\nFinal Leak Test\nPerformed after appliance installation using gas supply at normal static pressure for a minimum of 10 minutes.\nPressure Test Procedure\nIsolate the System\nIsolate the piping system that is to be tested to ensure accurate results.\nCap Open Ends\nCap or plug all open ends to create a sealed system for testing.\nInsert Pressure Gauge\nInsert a pressure gauge calibrated in 1/4 kPa (2 psig) increments or less at one end of the system.\nPressurize the System\nPressurize with air or inert gas (nitrogen or carbon dioxide) to the specified test pressure.\nRemove Pressure Source\nRemove the source of pressure and plug or cap the shut off valve.\nPressure Test Requirements Table\nWorking pressure, psig (kPa)\nDiameter of pipe or tubing\nLength of pipe or tubing ft (m)\nTest pressure psig (kPa)\nTest duration min\nUp to and including 2 (14)\nAll sizes\nAny length\n15 (100)\n15\nOver 2 (14) but not over 5 (35)\nAll sizes\n200 (60) or less\n15 (100)\n60\nOver 2 (14) but not over 5 (35)\nAll sizes\nMore than 200 (60)\n50 (340)\n180\nOver 5 (35) but not over 33 (230)\nAll sizes\nAny length\n50 (340)\n180\nLeak Detection Methods\nSoap Test\nA common method for detecting leaks in gas piping systems:\nWipe each joint or fitting in the suspect portion of the system with leak detector solution (soap and water)\nA leak will cause the solution to form bubbles at the source of the leak\nChecking Shut-off Valve Seepage\nBefore performing the leak test, check the gas meter valve for seepage:\nWhen the system is at static pressure, release a small amount of pressure by quickly removing, then replacing, the manometer tubing\nThis opens the service regulator and allows repressurization back to the gas meter shut-off valve\nIf pressure increases slowly to static pressure, the meter valve is seeping gas and should be serviced\nUnderground Piping Requirements\n15 in\nMinimum Depth\nGeneral minimum depth for underground piping (400 mm)\n24 in\nCommercial Areas\nMinimum depth under commercial driveways or parking lots (610 mm)\n6.15.4\nCode Reference\nCSA B149.1 clause specifying underground piping requirements\nAdditional depth of cover shall be required where the piping is located in areas where physical damage is likely to occur, such as farm operations.\nUnderground Piping Installation\nStandard Installation\nPiping entering a building shall rise above grade before entry, unless otherwise permitted by the authority having jurisdiction.\nThis is the preferred method as it reduces the risk of water infiltration and damage to the building foundation.\nBelow Grade Entry Exceptions\nWatertight Seal\nYou must provide a watertight seal where the piping passes through an outside wall below grade\nSleeve or Protection\nPiping or tubing passing through concrete or masonry walls must have a sleeve, coating, or double-wrap\nFooting Restrictions\nPiping may not pass under a footing or building wall because building settlement can cause crushing or rupture of the pipe\nSupports for Piping\nClause 6.8.3 of CSA B149.1 states that you must install aboveground piping with individual supports of sufficient strength and quality and space it according to Table 6.2.\nPipe Size (NPS)\nMaximum Spacing of Supports ft (m)\n1/2 or less - horizontal\n6 (2)\n3/4-1 - horizontal\n8 (2.5)\n1-1/4-2-1/2 - horizontal\n10 (3)\n3-4 - horizontal\n15 (5)\n6 - horizontal\n20 (6)\n8-12 or larger - horizontal\n24 (7)\nRooftop Piping Requirements\nSupport Requirements\nPiping must have support according to the distances outlined in Table 6.2, plus support at each change of direction and at each threaded connection\nSupport Materials\nRooftop supports should be treated wood blocks and pipe clamps, with protection for the roof membrane\nCertified Supports\nCertified rooftop pipe supports are also now available on the market\nExpansion Requirements\nWhen a rooftop piping run exceeds 100 ft in length in any one direction, a piping offset (expansion loop) is required\nRooftop Piping Expansion Solutions\nExpansion Loops\nWhen a rooftop piping run exceeds 100 ft in length in any one direction, a piping offset (expansion loop) is required to allow for expansion of the piping system as it heats with sun exposure.\nThis can be either:\nA site-assembled piping offset (see Annex G of CSA B149.1)\nAn engineered expansion joint\nBoth solutions allow expansion of piping to occur without damaging or breaking fittings and causing leaks.
