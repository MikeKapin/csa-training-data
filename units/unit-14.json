          "content": "Chapter 1 covers the fundamental concepts of viewing a building as an integrated system where all components interact to affect the flow of heat, air, and moisture. The building system consists of four main components: the building envelope (upper ceiling, walls, windows, doors, basement walls and floors), mechanical systems (heating, cooling, ventilation equipment, and appliances), the environment (outdoor conditions), and occupants (people, pets, plants, and their activities).\n\nMOISTURE AND HUMIDITY:\nMoisture attacks the building envelope from outside via exposed cracks, holes, uncovered earth in crawl spaces, open sump pump holes, and improper venting. The building envelope itself can create humidity from drying of framing and drywall in new or renovated buildings. Excess moisture from clothes washers, dryers, and household activities undermines the building envelope if not adequately vented.\n\nThe ideal relative humidity (RH) level in a home is 35 to 50%. Below that level, wood furniture cracks from excessive drying. Above that level, mould growth and condensation on windows increase.\n\nKey principles:\n- If a sealed house is heated, the RH decreases (humidity ratio stays same)\n- If a sealed house is cooled, the RH increases until it reaches saturation at 100% RH (dew point)\n- Continued cooling below the dew point results in condensation\n- Indoor air cooling below its dew point on cold surfaces causes interstitial condensation within the structure\n\nFIVE FORCES AFFECTING FLOW:\nThere are five forces (effects) that affect the flow of heat, air, and moisture in a building:\n\n1. STACK EFFECT:\nThe difference in temperature between indoor and outdoor creates a pressure difference due to difference in air densities. Cold air enters through holes in the lower portion of the building envelope, is heated, rises, and exits through holes in the upper building envelope. The stack effect creates:\n- Negative pressure condition in lower levels\n- Positive pressure condition in upper levels\n- Neutral pressure point (where pressure is zero) that varies\n\nThe neutral pressure point varies depending on:\n- Temperature difference between indoors and outdoors\n- Relative tightness of upper to lower portions of building\n\nOn cold days, the stack effect increases. The warm, light indoor air rises, creating a suction effect on lower levels. This causes \"pressure-induced backdrafting\" - the reversal of draft due to building depressurization that draws cold air down the chimney or causes spillage of flue gases indoors.\n\nHOUSE DEPRESSURIZATION LIMITS (Table 1-1):\n- Oil or gas, natural draft with dilution air:\n  * Unlined chimney on exterior wall: 5 Pa (0.02 in w.c.)\n  * Metal insulated or interior chimney: 5 Pa (0.02 in w.c.)\n- Fireplace (wood or gas): 5 Pa (0.02 in w.c.)\n- Airtight wood stove or fireplace: 10 Pa (0.04 in w.c.)\n- Mechanical draft (induced or forced): 10-15 Pa (0.04-0.06 in w.c.)\n\n2. WIND EFFECT:\nWind causes:\n- Positive pressure on the windward side of the building\n- Negative pressure on the leeward side and sides parallel to wind flow\n\nEffects on appliances:\n- Appliance on positive side: draft action and combustion air delivery may increase, causing decreased efficiency\n- Appliance on leeward side: suction action could pull air away from appliance and cause pressure-induced backdrafting\n\n3. FLUE AND VENTILATION EFFECT:\nHeat, air, and moisture flow due to operation of combustion appliances and mechanical exhaust devices (bathroom fans, kitchen range hoods, clothes dryers, central vacuum systems). All these devices remove air from the building and reduce indoor air pressure.\n\nKey points:\n- Some range hoods can remove over 500 ft³/min of air\n- Wood fireplace without doors or dampers is one of greatest consumers of indoor air\n- CSA B149.1 combustion air supply openings are designed only to replace air used in combustion, dilution of flue gases, and ventilation\n- These requirements are based on building pressures already being balanced\n\nSolution: Install direct-vent, sealed combustion appliances that do not use any indoor air. Use balanced ventilation system (HRV).\n\n4. DISTRIBUTION EFFECT:\nAny building with central ventilation or forced-air heating system may experience air flow problems due to supply and return air ducts. Problems can be grouped into design or workmanship issues.\n\nCommon design problems:\n- Return air registers in confined spaces where combustion/dilution air is consumed\n- Removal of more air from one floor than can be supplied, resulting in depressurization\n- Increasing pressure in room already pressurized, resulting in increased exfiltration\n- Short-circuiting of ventilation by having supply and return registers too close\n- Failing to counteract natural air flow in the room\n\nWorkmanship problems:\n- Leaky return air ducts (depressurized, air sucked through them)\n- Use of joist spaces with sheet metal bases as return ducts (especially leaky)\n- Loose-fitting filter frames and leaky blower doors\n\nSolution: Good workmanship - sealed return ducts, tight-fitting filters and doors, opening in warm air supply duct in furnace area.\n\n5. COMBINED EFFECT:\nThe four forces seldom act alone. The combined effect of stack effect, wind effect, flue and ventilation effect, and distribution effect must be considered when assessing the building as a system.\n\nThe greatest danger is backdrafting of chimney or vent. Spillage indoors must be prevented by assessing entire building for possible depressurization effects, checking chimney/vent for problems, and testing for flue gas spillage using the ACT procedure (assess, check, test) developed by CMHC.",

          "content": "Chapter 2 continues the building-as-a-system discussion by examining specific mechanical systems and the effects of occupants on building performance and gas appliance operation.\n\nTHROUGH-THE-WALL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS:\nThrough-the-wall distribution systems are only used with exhaust-only mechanical ventilation systems. These systems consist of air intake openings positioned high on walls or ceilings, mounted in each room or area to allow more controlled outside air supply compared to accidental infiltration.\n\nThe negative pressure created by exhaust fan(s) causes air to enter through designed inlet diffusers. Less air is drawn through the building envelope, and negative pressure is minimized. This resolves major problems created by exhaust-only systems.\n\nHigh inlets move warm air away from ceilings and allow some preheating before reaching occupants. A separate circulation system is necessary for even distribution of fresh air.\n\nCAUTION: These systems are not suitable for houses taller than two storeys because upper inlets become outlets for stack effect, thus increasing negative building pressure. If a house is well-sealed and series of through-the-wall exhaust fans are installed, their operation can lead to serious health hazards since depressurization could cause furnace or fireplace to backdraft and draw poisonous gases into house.\n\nOTHER MECHANICAL/ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT:\n\n1. RANGES AND OVENS:\nCooking devices contribute heat and odours to house, and dangerous gases in case of gas units.\n\n2. CLOTHES DRYERS:\n- Exhaust capacity exceeds 85 L/s (180 cfm)\n- For 1200 ft² bungalow, clothes dryer alone would effect 0.6 ACH\n- Must terminate outdoors\n- Drying clothes indoors or venting dryer indoors can add 10 L of moisture per week to house with family of four\n- Venting gas-fired dryers outdoors is CRITICAL for preventing recirculation of combustion gases\n\n3. WASHING MACHINES:\nWashing clothes or dishes can add as much as 4 L of moisture per week to house with family of four. Added ventilation to area may be required.\n\n4. REFRIGERATORS:\nHeat and moisture effects add another variable. Some older units may add 3 or 4 times as much moisture as newer, better-insulated models.\n\n5. HUMIDIFIERS AND DEHUMIDIFIERS:\nPresence or absence affects level of control over moisture flow. Proper installation and maintenance are essential.\n\n6. AIR CLEANERS:\nWhere these devices are installed and how they are maintained has great effect on air, heat, and moisture flow. Filters on recirculating kitchen fans or supply intake fans are as important as one on forced-air furnace.\n\n7. CENTRAL VACUUM CLEANERS:\nIf vented outdoors, can cause significant building depressurization during operation.\n\n8. LIGHTING AND ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES:\nHeat produced from all electrical devices, especially incandescent lighting, has significant effect on comfort levels. Exceptional usage should be factored into any assessment.\n\nOCCUPANTS:\nThe effect of occupants on other components of building system and on flow of air, heat, and moisture is most variable and difficult to predict. Although gas technician/fitter has limited means of monitoring or controlling effects occupants have, it is important to assess potential influence.\n\nASSESSING EFFECTS OF OCCUPANTS:\n\n1. NUMBER AND AGE OF HUMAN OCCUPANTS:\n- Elderly couple usually wants room temperature and humidity higher, opens doors less, has fewer activities that negatively impact IAQ\n- Flow of air, heat, and moisture is more difficult to control with more and younger occupants\n\n2. ACTIVITIES OF HUMAN OCCUPANTS:\n- Activities requiring extensive use of exhaust systems can significantly affect building and appliance operation\n- Hobbies like woodworking, commercial or home-based businesses like cooking\n- Note unusual activities that could affect flow of heat, air, or moisture or affect air quality\n\n3. UNUSUAL NUMBER OR SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS:\n- Large number of plants or animals alters building as system\n- Increased moisture level is main concern\n- Air quality and air consumption issues may pose problems for gas appliances\n\n4. TYPE AND CONDITION OF FURNISHINGS:\n- Home full of antique wood furniture requires more attention to heat distribution and humidity levels\n- Position of furniture in relation to heating and ventilation distribution registers should be observed\n- Blocked registers can adversely affect operation of gas appliance\n\n5. TYPE AND LOCATION OF FLOOR COVERINGS:\n- Occupant's choice of tile or carpet over radiant floor heating can affect appliance performance\n- Area rugs or carpets that block forced air registers can adversely affect gas appliance operation\n\n6. ODOURS AND USE OF CHEMICALS:\n- Warning signs of inadequate ventilation or improper use/storage of chemicals\n- Consider how odours indicate problems that may affect building as system and gas appliances\n\n7. UNUSUAL WATER USES:\n- Maintaining large open aquariums\n- Drying clothes indoors\n- Activities that adversely increase moisture levels in building\n\nADVICE TO OCCUPANTS:\n\nAIR FLOW:\n- Provide wind breaks on windward side of house\n- Air-seal the house, especially upper floors and ceiling\n- Install, use, or maintain mechanical ventilation system\n- Open window when using wood fireplace\n- Never block air supply opening to appliance or appliance room\n\nSPECIAL ATTENTION: Outside termination of air supply inlet to appliance or appliance room must remain unobstructed by plants or snow. Maintain 12 in (304.8 mm) clearance above highest anticipated snow level or grade, whichever is greater. For appliances using indoor air supplied from outdoors by vent or duct, inside termination must also remain unobstructed.\n\nHEAT FLOW:\n- Provide building with better exposure to sunlight\n- Install insulation or better windows in building envelope\n- Replace exhaust-only or supply-only ventilation system with HRV\n- Do not obstruct return or supply air registers with furniture/carpets\n- Open drapes/curtains during day and close them at night\n\nMOISTURE FLOW:\n- Direct eavestrough flow away from house\n- Grade lawn away from house\n- Repair water leaks in building envelope, especially basements\n- Install and operate exhaust fans in bathrooms and kitchens\n- Cover aquariums and do not dry clothes indoors\n- Never vent clothes dryer into building\n\nIMPORTANT: Some occupants may redirect properly vented clothes dryer to vent indoors using devices available at hardware stores. This is especially dangerous practice for gas-fired clothes dryers because combustion gases with potentially poisonous gases are also emitted into building.\n\nAIR QUALITY:\n- Reduce exposure to vehicle exhaust by not running vehicles in garage\n- Install tight-fitting, self-closing door to attached garage\n- Eliminate, separate, ventilate, or filtrate any pollutants\n- Remove contaminants to safe outdoor storage location\n\nThe building-as-a-system approach is based on principle that every change occurring in and around building has potential for improving or deteriorating system. Wide range of changes by occupants must be considered for their effects on entire building system, especially gas-fired appliances.",

          "content": "Chapter 3 provides detailed procedures for assessing buildings to identify and prevent combustion gas spillage problems using the ACT (Assess, Check, Test) procedure developed by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC).\n\nACT PROCEDURE - BASIC VENTING TEST:\nThe sequence of preparation steps must be followed to prevent problems. Spillage tests must be conducted as each appliance is activated. If possible, conduct spillage tests again after 15 min (or more) of operation. If there is more than one appliance, start with smallest one and test all spillage points at all appliances and vent connections. Then activate next largest appliance and check for spillage at all points again.\n\nPREPARATION CHECKLIST:\n1. Close all doors and windows except interior doors to rooms with exhaust fans\n2. Check wind speed (light winds are desirable)\n3. Turn on all exhaust devices - dryers, range hood, fans, central vacuum, HRV on exhaust-only mode\n4. Turn off heating appliances by their disconnect switch\n5. Turn up thermostat\n6. Turn off hot water valve on gas hot water heater\n7. Prepare draft gauge or smoke pencil\n\nNote: If weather conditions are unsuitable (too windy or very cold) for basic test to simulate worst-case conditions, recommend that basic test be conducted at another time.\n\nTEST PROCEDURE:\nWith heating appliances off and cool, check if there is spillage from draft hood, barometric damper, or inspection port of any appliances. Turn on each appliance, starting with smallest input, and immediately check for spillage. Leave each appliance on as you activate next one, so all are firing by end. After each activation, check for spillage at all test points of all appliances.\n\n30-SECOND RULE:\nIf spillage occurs, does it cease within 30 seconds? If spillage ceases, test is complete and house passes. If spillage continues, house has failed test.\n\nFAILURE RESPONSE:\nWritten notice of failure must be given to owner/occupant and fuel supplier, along with recommendation to conduct depressurization test or take specific remedial action.\n\nACT CHECKLIST - COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDED ACTION:\nThe form assists in informing customer of ACT results. Actions can be marked as Required, Recommended, or N/A:\n\n1. A depressurization test should be conducted\n2. A heat exchanger leak test should be conducted\n3. Additional combustion air should be introduced\n4. Additional ventilation air should be introduced\n5. Additional make-up air should be introduced\n6. The following changes to venting system should be introduced:\n   - Replace vent connector\n   - Repair masonry chimney\n   - Install metal chimney liner\n   - Replace metal chimney or vent\n   - Install rain cap or flashing\n   - Relocate sidewall termination\n7. Others\n\nIMPORTANCE OF ACT PROCEDURE:\nThe ACT procedure and depressurization tests are neither commonly used nor well-known by gas technicians/fitters. As building envelopes became more airtight and appliance efficiency increased by giving up less to vent, depressurization problems have increased. The trend toward tighter houses and more efficient appliances continues, so spillage problems created by house depressurization will probably increase.\n\nHOUSE DEPRESSURIZATION TESTING:\nField tests can be performed to determine amount of negative pressure appliances and exhausting equipment are creating. Test is performed with handheld Magnehelic or inclined manometer. These instruments can measure pressure differences in 0 to 60 Pa (0.0 to 0.25 in w.c.) range.\n\nThis field test is not meant as alternative to airtightness test required for construction and certification of R-2000 and ENERGY STAR homes. These standards require that licenced tester confirm airtightness of building envelope by way of controlled, standardized fan depressurization test. Typically, a blower door test is used.\n\nCSA F300:\nCSA F300 was developed to address issues and concerns arising from depressurization of existing houses. The standard describes methods for determining level of depressurization and solutions to mitigate risk arising from depressurization.\n\nLevel of depressurization shall be determined when additions or modifications are made to any of the following:\n- The building envelope\n- An exhaust device\n- A combustion appliance\n- The enclosure within which combustion appliance is installed\n\nDEPRESSURIZATION TEST PROCEDURE:\nA depressurization test measures negative pressure in building under test conditions. Test conditions may be passive (using only exhaust equipment in building, like basic venting test) or active (using large exhaust fan to create severe negative building pressure, usually -10 Pa or -0.05 in w.c.).\n\nWARNING: Performing depressurization tests, including basic venting test, can create dangerous conditions with flue gas spillage. A CO detector must be employed throughout these tests.\n\nTEST STEPS (CSA F300 passive field test):\n1. Close and latch all windows, doors, and other openings. Fill floor drains and plumbing traps with water or seal.\n\n2. Seal combustion air inlets and chimneys or flues for combustion appliances, including fireplaces and wood stoves. Sealing of combustion air inlets and chimneys or flues is not required if combustion devices are operating during test and there is no combustion spillage from any appliance during test.\n\n3. Set exterior pressure tap approximately at least 3 m (10 ft) from building and connect to measuring device. Locate measuring device at or near grade level inside building.\n\n4. Switch off ventilation equipment and any other appliances that exhaust air to exterior. Record measured pressure difference. This is starting or \"rest\" pressure.\n\n5. Turn on all foundation exhaust fans (e.g., radon fans) designed for continuous operation.\n\n6. Switch on all equipment used to provide ventilation capacity as required by NBC. Record pressure difference. Difference between this measurement and rest pressure is continuous depressurization, which can be used to design or modify make-up system.\n\n7. Switch on dryer and all exhaust equipment with CFM over 75 L/s. Record pressure difference. Difference between this measurement and rest pressure is maximum house depressurization.\n\n8. Unseal any openings that were sealed for test.\n\nTEST RESULTS AND REMEDIES:\nThe values measured must fall within these acceptable limits:\n\n- Maximum allowable pressure difference is 5 Pa (0.02 in w.c.) in all conditions if any non-direct vent fuel-fired, vented combustion appliances are present\n- Maximum allowable pressure difference for other rated appliances is set by manufacturer\n\nSOLUTIONS IF VALUES EXCEED ACCEPTABLE LIMITS:\n- Determine which appliance can be adapted or changed\n- Replace or upgrade standard furnace with balancing ventilation non-spillage appliance\n- Replace standard fireplace with direct-vent fireplace\n- Replace conventional domestic water heater with direct-vent water heater\n- Replace bathroom and kitchen exhaust fans with HRV\n- Revent central vacuum system indoors\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not vent dryers indoors, since this introduces contaminants (odours, dust, and moisture) into house.\n\nHRAI DEPRESSURIZATION TEST REPORT FORM:\nComplete form includes:\n- Building information\n- Technician certification\n- Test equipment details\n- Ventilation design specifications\n- Other exhaust appliances\n- Combustion appliances\n- Measurements (rest pressure, principal ventilation capacity, total ventilation capacity)\n- Depressurization at TVCC (Total Ventilation Capacity - Continuous)\n- Depressurization at CEC (Capacity of all Exhaust and Combustion devices)\n- Test results (conforms or does not conform)\n- Certification signature",

          "content": "Chapter 4 examines indoor air quality (IAQ), sources of pollution, control methods, and ventilation requirements for residential buildings.\n\nPOOR IAQ DEFINITION:\nPoor IAQ (as described by HRAI) occurs \"when inside air contains enough of a substance to adversely affect comfort, health, or safety of occupants\".\n\nPoor air quality is direct result of combination of high pollutant levels and inadequate ventilation and other control methods that exhaust or neutralize polluted indoor air. Frequent air exchange ensures that pollutants from household air are removed with speed and efficiency.\n\nSOURCES OF POLLUTION:\nSources of indoor air pollution can be divided into two main categories:\n\n1. CHEMICAL POLLUTANTS:\nFrom building materials, cleaning fluids, cigarette smoke, furniture and rug finishes, etc.\n\nTABLE 4-1: SOURCES OF INDOOR AIR POLLUTION (GASES AND LIQUIDS):\n\n- RADON (Rn): Colourless, odourless, radioactive gas generated from decay of radium (mineral in earth's crust). Source: Air leakage from ground or rock beneath building, from ground water, or construction products (concrete and masonry).\n\n- FORMALDEHYDE (HCHO): Strong-smelling, colourless gas. Source: Construction materials; glues in particleboard, plywood, furniture, and textiles; also in tobacco smoke.\n\n- CARBON MONOXIDE (CO): Colourless, odourless, tasteless gas, at times released during combustion. Source: Fireplaces, woodstoves, unvented gas appliances, and automotive engines in attached garages.\n\n- CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2): Colourless, odourless gas. Source: Respiration, fuel, burning equipment, tobacco smoke.\n\n- NITROGEN DIOXIDE (NO2): Colourless, odourless, tasteless gas. Source: Combustion appliances (kerosene heaters), smoking.\n\n- METHANE (CH4): Visibly undetectable, with detectable odour added. Source: Natural gas piping or appliance leak or venting.\n\n- PROPANE (C3H8): Visibly undetectable, with detectable odour added. Source: Propane gas piping or appliance leak or venting.\n\n- VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOCs): Visibly undetectable, but detectable odour. Source: Furnishings, adhesives, solvents, pesticides, cleaning and cooking products.\n\n- WATER (H2O): Humid, condenses on walls and windows. Source: Cooking, showering, new furnishings and leaky basements.\n\n- RESPIRABLE PARTICULATES (RSP): Particles less than 0.25 microns in air that can be drawn into lungs. Source: Unvented combustion appliances, some humidifiers, house dust, wood smoke, and tobacco smoke.\n\n2. BIOLOGICAL POLLUTANTS:\nFrom people, pets, and plants.\n\nSources of airborne biological pollutants include:\n- Human hair and skin flakes\n- Animal dander\n- Pollen\n- Mould spores\n- Dust mites and dust mite debris\n- Fungi\n- Lint\n- Bacteria and viruses\n- Tobacco and wood smoke\n- Household dust\n\nTABLE 4-2: AIRBORNE BIOLOGICAL POLLUTANTS AND THEIR EFFECTS:\n\n- BACTERIA (Legionella, Thermoactinomyces, endotoxin, proteases): Causes pneumonia, Pontiac fever, hypersensitivity pneumonitis fever, chills, asthma. Source: Cooling towers, hot water sources, stagnant water reservoirs, industrial processes.\n\n- FUNGI (Alternaria, Histoplasma, Cladosporium, Aspergillus, Penicillium, aflatoxins, aldehydes): Causes asthma, rhinitis, allergies, systemic infection, cancer, mucous membrane irritants. Source: Damp surfaces, bird droppings.\n\n- PROTOZOA (Naegleria, Acanthamoeba): Causes infection, hypersensitivity, pneumonitis. Source: Contaminated water, reservoirs.\n\n- VIRUSES (influenza): Causes respiratory infections. Source: Human hosts.\n\n- ALGAE (Chlorococcus): Causes asthma, rhinitis, allergies. Source: Outdoor air.\n\n- GREEN PLANTS (Ambrosia): Causes asthma, rhinitis, allergies. Source: Outdoor air (pollen).\n\n- ARTHROPOD (dust mites, cockroaches): Causes asthma, rhinitis, allergies. Source: House dust (feces).\n\n- MAMMALS (humans, horses, dogs, cats): Causes asthma, rhinitis, allergies. Source: House dust (skin scales, saliva, urine).\n\nExcess moisture, dust, and inadequately vented air contribute, in varying degrees, to increased chemical and biological pollution of indoor environment.\n\nCONTROL METHODS AND PRIORITIES:\nPriorities for improving air quality inside building are to reduce or eliminate source of pollutants and minimize their effects through better ventilation and, to lesser extent, filtration.\n\nCONTROL AT SOURCE:\nAlthough there are many and varied ways of controlling IAQ, often combination of several approaches is most effective.\n\nMethods to control indoor air:\n\n1. REMOVAL: Store chemicals outside living space\n2. SUBSTITUTION: Non-polluting products should be chosen in preference to polluting products\n3. CONTAINMENT: Store household chemicals in airtight, vented cabinet\n4. CONTROL: At design stage of new construction or renovation\n5. AIR TREATMENT/VENTILATION: Filtration, HVAC (heating, venting, and air conditioning)\n6. HUMIDIFICATION AND DEHUMIDIFICATION: Add or remove moisture\n7. LOCAL EXHAUST: Range hoods and bathroom exhausts use filtration and ventilation\n\nVENTILATION AND FILTRATION:\nVentilation and filtration are two commonly used methods of pollutant control.\n\nVENTILATION: A good ventilation system has overall capacity to ventilate house, distribute fresh air to habitable rooms, include mechanisms to control pollutants through removal at source, provide for make-up or relief air if necessary, and include appropriate ducting and control system.\n\nFILTRATION: The process of passing liquid through device or porous substance to remove solids or impurities - removal of particulates (not gases) from air stream.\n\nAs gas technician/fitter, main concern is with ventilation systems since you may be required to provide ventilation air to areas containing gas appliances. Important to be familiar with current NBC and HRAI requirements related to mechanical ventilation of residential buildings. CSA B149.1 requirements pertaining to air supply are covered in unit \"Venting practices\".\n\nNATIONAL BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS FOR VENTILATION:\nNBC and province-specific codes establish requirements for ventilation of rooms and spaces in residential occupancies by natural ventilation and mechanical ventilation systems, serving only one dwelling unit. In typical house, these target ventilation rates dilute air pollutants generated within house (carbon dioxide, humidity, and odours).\n\nHowever, in case of home located in area with poor outdoor air quality, increasing ventilation may not improve IAQ. Ventilation may need to be scheduled during periods of low outdoor pollution levels, such as early morning. Check \"air quality health index\" in your community, especially during \"smog season\" (from April to September).\n\nGENERAL:\nEvery dwelling unit shall incorporate provisions for non-heating-season ventilation in accordance with NBC. If supplied with electrical power, provisions for heating and ventilation must be in accordance with code.\n\nNON-HEATING-SEASON - VENTILATION REQUIRED:\n1. Rooms or spaces in dwelling units must be ventilated during non-heating season by natural ventilation or by conforming mechanical ventilation systems.\n\n2. If habitable room or space is not provided with natural ventilation, mechanical ventilation must be provided to exhaust inside air from, or introduce outside air to, that room.\n\nAir change per hour:\n- If room/space is mechanically cooled during non-heating season: 0.5 ACH\n- If room/space is not mechanically cooled during non-heating season: 1 ACH\n\nNATURAL VENTILATION AREA:\nUnobstructed openable ventilation area to outdoors for rooms and spaces in residential buildings ventilated by natural means must conform to NBC Table 9.32.2.2:\n\nWITHIN A DWELLING UNIT:\n- Bathrooms or water closet rooms: 0.09 m² (0.97 ft²)\n- Unfinished basement space: 0.2% of floor area\n- Dining rooms, living rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, combined rooms, dens, recreation rooms, and all other finished rooms: 0.28 m² (3 ft²) per room or combination of rooms\n\nOTHER THAN WITHIN DWELLING UNIT:\n- Bathrooms or water closet rooms: 0.09 m² (0.97 ft²) per water closet\n- Sleeping areas: 0.14 m² (1.5 ft²) per occupant\n- Laundry rooms, kitchens, recreation rooms: 4% of floor area\n- Corridors, storage rooms, and other similar public rooms or spaces: 2% of floor area\n- Unfinished basement space not used on shared basis: 0.2% of floor area\n\nHEATING SEASON - MECHANICAL VENTILATION REQUIRED:\nEvery dwelling unit supplied with electrical power must be provided with mechanical ventilation system, complying with CSA F326, and various articles and sections in NBC.\n\nDESIGN AND INSTALLATION:\nAspects of mechanical ventilation systems not specifically detailed in NBC must be designed, constructed, and installed in accordance with good practice, as described in publications from ASHRAE, HRAI, Hydronics Institute, and SMACNA (Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning National Association).\n\nTOTAL VENTILATION CAPACITY (TVC):\nMinimum TVC of ventilation system required in NBC must be sum of individual room capacities specified in NBC.\n\nNBC TABLE 9.32.2.3 - AIR CHANGE RATE:\n- Master bedroom: 10 L/s\n- Other bedrooms: 5 L/s\n- Living room: 5 L/s\n- Dining room: 5 L/s\n- Family room: 5 L/s\n- Recreation room: 5 L/s\n- Basement: 10 L/s\n- Kitchen: 5 L/s\n- Bathroom or water-closet room: 5 L/s\n- Laundry room: 5 L/s\n- Utility room: 5 L/s\n- Other habitable rooms: 5 L/s\n\nMECHANICAL VENTILATION SYSTEMS: ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES:\nUntil recently, mechanical ventilation was not considered important in residential buildings. It was assumed that natural ventilation through actions of wind and \"stack effect\" and operation of heating appliances would create sufficient air movement through leaks and cracks in building envelope. In new houses or older homes brought up to current air tightness standards, it is no longer sufficient to rely solely on accidental ventilation.\n\nHRAI defines three basic concerns related to mechanical ventilation of house:\n1. Bringing in proper amount of ventilation air\n2. Distributing air to required locations\n3. Avoiding excessive pressurization or depressurization\n\nCAUTIONS:\n- Installing supply-only system in leaky house can lead to problems with moisture-laden air being driven into wall cavities\n- If house is well sealed and series of through-the-wall exhaust fans are installed, operation can lead to serious health hazards since depressurization could cause furnace or fireplace to backdraft\n- Too much ventilation costs homeowner more than necessary; if cost is significant, homeowner may be tempted to turn ventilation system off\n- Too little ventilation leads to buildup of pollutants in air\n\nAlthough gas technician/fitter must be aware of effects that ventilation system has on building as system and on gas appliance operation, gas technician/fitter certificate does not authorize holder to install ventilation systems. Further training is required to design, install, and service ventilation systems that are part of gas appliance.\n\nCO ALARMS:\nAlthough gas-fired appliances do not normally produce CO, appliance can malfunction or backdraft. Therefore, NBC has requirements for installation of CO alarms as low-cost backup safety measure. Combination CO/combustible gas alarms are low-cost safety measures that detect natural gas or propane leaks as well as elevated CO levels indoors.\n\nFILTRATION SYSTEMS:\nFiltering air can reduce some indoor air pollutants, but air cleaning is rarely effective on its own and should be used in conjunction with ventilation and reducing contaminants at sources. Although there are many types of furnace air filters available for residential market, majority are designed to protect coils and heat exchangers of mechanical equipment and have little impact on air quality.\n\nMERV RATING:\nFilters have minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) rating that indicates how effectively they trap particles. Scale is designed to represent worst-case performance of filter when dealing with particles in range of 0.3 to 10 µm. MERV rating is from 1 to 16. Higher MERV ratings correspond to greater percentage of particles captured on each pass, with MERV 16 filter capturing more than 95% of particles over full range. MERV 8 filters are common although R-2000 home requires minimum MERV 13 filter.\n\nHEPA FILTERS:\nPortable air cleaners, particularly high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters and electrostatic precipitators, can reduce some air contaminants. HEPA filters collect 99.95% of particle pollutants that have size greater than or equal to 0.3 µm. Air cleaners can be effective in removing particles, but most do not remove gases.\n\nDetailed information on air filters and cleaners is provided in unit \"Forced-air add-on devices\".",

          "content": "CSA Unit 14- The Building as \na System \nChapter 1\nSignificant advances in home building technologies and materials over \nthe past several decades, including energy conservation, air leakage \ncontrol, improved insulation, etc., also indicate that a gas \ntechnician/fitter must take a new approach. Gas technicians/fitters must \nbe thoroughly familiar with prevailing construction methods and \ntechnologies that support the concept of a building as a series of \ninterdependent parts. This concept is generally known as \"the building as \na system\".\nMK by Mike Kapin\nCreated\nCopywrite 2025\nPurpose and Objectives\nPurpose\nThis chapter describes the key components of building-as-\na-system construction and how they affect the gas \ntechnician/fitter.\nObjectives\nAt the end of this chapter you will be able to:\n•\nDefine key components of the building as a system\n•\nDescribe the relationship between key components to \nheat, moisture, and air flow\n•\nDescribe how to minimize negative impacts of heat, \nmoisture, and air flow on the building\nKey Terminology\nTerm\nAbbreviation (symbol)\nDefinition\nAbsolute humidity\nThe actual amount of water vapour contained in a given \namount of air, regardless of the temperature of the air. This is \nalso called \"humidity ratio\".\nBackdrafting\nThe reverse flow of gas in the flues of fuel-fired appliances \nthat results in the intrusion of combustion by-products into \nthe living space.\nCondensation\nThe process by which dew, or condensate, is formed. In this \nprocess, moisture changes state from a gas (water vapour) to \na liquid (water).\nDew point\nThe point at which any body of air is saturated with water \n(100% RH).\nExfiltrate\nExit\nInfiltrate\nEnter\nInterstitial condensation\nIndoor air leaking into the walls or attic may drop water within \nthe structure as it is cooled below its dew point.\nRelative humidity\nRH\nThe amount of water vapour contained in the air expressed as \na percentage of the maximum amount that could be \ncontained in the air at the same temperature.\nWater vapour\nMicroscopic water molecules that are suspended in air.\nComponents of the Building System\nA system consists of a number of distinct parts or components that are linked together, such that a change in one usually \ncauses a change in others. You will deal with systems every day and—whether you realize it or not—the only way you begin to \nunderstand how things work (sports teams, work sites, cars, etc.) is by approaching them as a system. You will recognize that \nthey consist of several parts and take action or make judgments based on how the parts are related.\nDynamic Systems\nSystems are dynamic. They are \nconstantly changing in response \nto internal and external forces. \nEach time a change is made to \none component, the entire \nsystem is affected.\nBuilding as a System\nThe building is a system. A \nsystems approach is essential in \norder to understand how it \nworks. The purpose of the \nbuilding is to provide comfort for \nthe occupants.\nInterconnected Parts\nTaking a systems approach to \nany complex problem means \nconsidering the role of each \ncomponent not simply for its \nindividual purpose or operating \ncharacteristics but also for its \nlarger purpose or operation \nwithin the system.\nFour Major Subsystems\nBuilding Envelope\nConsists of the upper ceiling, walls, \nwindows, doors, basement walls, and \nbasement floors. The envelope \nseparates the indoors from the \noutdoors.\nMechanical and Electrical \nEquipment\nIncludes all equipment and \nappliances that contribute to the \ngeneration of heat or moisture or \ncause the movement of air.\nOccupants\nIncludes all the people, pets, plants, \nand other non-mechanical/electrical \ncomponents that occupy the building \nenvelope.\nOutside Environment\nIncludes climatic conditions, shade, \nlocation, age of the building, gravity, \nand orientation of the building.\nBuilding Envelope\nThe building envelope consists of the upper ceiling, walls, windows, doors, basement walls, and basement floors. The envelope \nseparates the indoors from the outdoors!\nDefines Indoor Space\nThe building envelope defines \nthe indoor space, which is \ngoverned by other systems and \ndevices that relate to the \nactivities taking place inside the \nbuilding.\nControls Flow\nBesides supporting the walls and \nroof, the envelope helps to \ncontrol the flow of heat, air, and \nmoisture between the inside of \nthe building and the external \nenvironment.\nDetermines Heat Loss\nIt is primarily the components of \nthe building envelope that \ndetermine the rate of heat loss \nfrom the building. The better it is \ninsulated and sealed from air and \nmoisture movement, the less \nheat, air, and moisture are \ntransferred.\nConstruction Type Impact\nHeat Flow Impact\nThe type of construction has a \ngreat effect on the flow of heat. \nKnowledge of the component \nparts in various types of \nconstruction and how they \ninfluence heat flow is necessary \nfor controlling comfort in the \nindoor environment.\nAir Flow Impact\nConstruction methods directly \naffect how air moves through the \nbuilding envelope. Proper sealing \nand barriers are essential to \ncontrol air movement between \nindoor and outdoor \nenvironments.\nMoisture Flow Impact\nDifferent construction materials and techniques handle moisture \ndifferently. Understanding how moisture moves through various building \ncomponents is critical for preventing damage and maintaining indoor air \nquality.\nMechanical and Electrical Systems\nThe separation from outdoors provided by the building envelope allows for the creation of a separate indoor environment with its own temperature, humidity level, and air characteristics. The mechanical and \nelectrical systems are responsible for creating that indoor environment to a large extent.\nHeating and Cooling\n•\nSpace heating and cooling equipment\nAppliances\n•\nRanges and ovens\nAir Management\n•\nExhaust and supply fans\nImpact of Mechanical Systems\nAdd Heat\nHeating systems, appliances, and lighting all contribute heat to the indoor environment\nTransfer Heat\nDistribution systems move heat from one area to another within the building\nMove Air\nVentilation systems, fans, and blowers create air movement patterns throughout the \nbuilding\nAffect Moisture\nMany systems add or remove moisture, impacting indoor humidity levels\nAll of these devices add, transfer, or remove heat, air, or moisture to and from the building. Their \nindividual operation affects the operation of the entire building system and can help or hinder the \nultimate goal of achieving a comfortable indoor environment.\nOccupants\nPeople\nRelease heat, moisture, \nand pollutants into the \nindoor space\nPets\nContribute to indoor air \nquality and moisture levels\nPlants\nAffect humidity and air \nquality within the building\nControl\nOccupants control \nmechanical systems and \nmodify the building \nenvelope\nThe range and timing of the effects on the building system that are caused by the \noccupants vary widely and are difficult to predict or control. However, these effects \nshould never be neglected or underestimated if proper functioning of the building \nsystem is to be achieved.\nExternal Environment\nNo building envelope can or should completely separate the indoors from the outdoors. The outside environment has both positive and negative effects on the functioning of \nthe other subsystems of the building, just as those subsystems affect the outside environment (to a lesser degree).\nOutside features\nDescription or examples\nClimatic and seasonal conditions\nFrequency of exposure to sun, wind, rain, snow, etc.\nShade\nShade trees and other shade elements\nLocation\nAbove/below steep slopes, proximity to bodies of water, ground gases, heavy \ntraffic that emits pollutants, etc.\nAge of the building\nNew homes are considerably more airtight than older homes. New buildings are \nsubject to materials shrinking, expanding, and settling, and external conditions can \naccelerate or slow down this process.\nGravity\nAffects water running downwards, as from a roof or down a windowpane, door \nframe; also building settling.\nOrientation of the building\nEspecially the window exposure-in relation to the forces of the outside \nenvironment-can have a significant effect on the other parts of the building \nsystem.\nBuilding Orientation Effects\nSummer Conditions\nWindow shaded to avoid overheating\nWinter Conditions\nWindow exposed to admit radiant energy\nFlow of Heat, Air, and Moisture\nBuilding System Balance\nControlling the flow of all three elements\nHeat Flow\nFlows from hot to cold\nAir Flow\nFlows from high pressure to low pressure\nMoisture Flow\nFlows from high water pressure to low water pressure\nThe key factors determining heat comfort, indoor air quality, and the structural \"health\" of the building are the flow of heat, air, and moisture. \nAlthough the three flow factors are interrelated, they are best understood for purposes of control in the building system by focusing on their \nroot cause (i.e., what principle causes heat, air, or moisture to move when all other factors are kept the same).\nFive Forces Affecting Flow\nStack Effect\nTemperature differences \nbetween indoor and outdoor air \ncreate pressure differences that \ncause air movement vertically \nthrough the building\nWind Effect\nWind creates positive pressure \non windward sides and negative \npressure on leeward sides of the \nbuilding\nFlue and Ventilation \nEffect\nOperation of combustion \nappliances and exhaust devices \ncreates pressure differences\nDistribution Effect\nCentral ventilation and forced air heating systems \ncreate air flow patterns\nCombined Effect\nAll forces working together in a dynamic system\nHeat Flow Principles\nHeat flows from hot to cold by conduction, convection, and radiation. If you want to reduce or increase heat flow, you have to reduce or increase exposure between hot and cold substances.\nConduction\nHeat transfer through direct contact between materials. \nInsulation reduces conductive heat transfer by creating air \npockets that slow the movement of heat.\nConvection\nHeat transfer through the movement of fluids (",
