          "content": "Chapter 1 covers air conditioning, condensate removal, venting practices, application and approval, sizing, and commissioning of forced warm-air heating systems. Air conditioning is common addition to furnace heating system. Cased coil added downstream of furnace can have significant effect on appliance operation. Gas technician/fitter needs basic understanding of air-conditioning system and associated components. Simple air-conditioning system with furnace shows 118 psig liquid line, 473 psig at condensing unit, outdoor air at 95 °F, 75 °F return air temperature, 55 °F supply air temperature. Components include fused disconnect, control panel access wrapper, condensing unit on concrete pad with 1 ft 0 in space required from unit to wall, and access cover on furnace.\n\nCondensate removal: condensate drain piping drains all liquid waste produced by combustion process. Manufacturers of condensing furnaces incorporate condensate collection into appliance design, but some vent pipe installations may require additional condensate drainage. Downward vent drainage requires 40 in upflow or downflow furnace with 6 in minimum height, downward vent length limited to maximum 15 equivalent feet, all horizontal pipes supported at maximum 3 ft intervals, slope 1/4 in per ft. Furnace may be in vertical or horizontal configuration.\n\nInstall drain tee or inline fitting in vent pipe to provide means for condensate removal that may form in venting system. Grade all vent piping towards appliance and condensate-removal fitting (must be as close to appliance as possible or at any point where condensate may form, more than one fitting if required). If vent piping runs through unheated section of building, insulate piping.\n\nCondensate piping from appliance slopes downward and terminates into DWV system. If no floor drain near furnace, condensate pump or sump pump may be required to pump condensate to drain. Place piping where condensate won't freeze so pipes won't become blocked. Due to potential corrosive effects of condensate on DWV system, local jurisdictions may require neutralizer be installed. Install cap in piping to allow checking and clearing pipe of any blockages. If condensate drain piping becomes blocked, condensate can run back down piping and into furnace causing furnace to shut down or damaging furnace. Sometimes condensate safety-level sensor can be installed to detect when condensate running back into furnace (sensor causes furnace to shut down).\n\nHigh-efficiency furnaces must have condensate trap to separate pressure of vent system from drain system. If condensate trap improperly installed or there are two condensate traps, air pocket between traps quickly prevents draining of system.\n\nVenting practices: sizing and configuration criteria for B-vents covered in CSA B149.1. Modern Category-IV furnaces use Type BH vent or special venting systems and installed using manufacturer instructions. Furnace manufacturers have information in literature on recommended practices. Overview of vent material, sizing, installation requirements, and terminations.\n\nMaterial: when selecting material for vent of direct-vent appliance, material needs to be Type BH vent material. CSA B149.1 states Type BH vent is \"vent complying with ULC S636 consisting entirely of factory-made parts, each designed to be assembled with others without requiring field fabrication, and intended for venting gas appliances\". Typical ULC S636 materials for venting condensing direct-vent appliance are PVC plastic, CPVC plastic, PP (polypropylene) plastic, and stainless steel. Combustion air supply pipe for direct-vent appliance only needs to be certified for use by manufacturer (most likely does not need ULC S636-certified). Common pipe materials for combustion air supply can be PVC plastic, CPVC plastic, and ABS.\n\nSizing: sizing of vent and combustion air-supply pipes for direct-vent appliance done using manufacturer literature information. Each pipe size has maximum length to ensure appliance operation not affected. Each fitting installed on vent or combustion air piping must be accounted for as equivalent length of pipe.\n\nInstallation requirements: manufacturer installation requirements must be followed. Pipe grade and pipe-support requirements very important to long-term operation. All materials expand and contract as heat and cool so movement must be accommodated. Canadian applications require primer and cement from single-system manufacturer. Pipe manufacturers include guidelines on correct primer and cement for each material type as well as application instructions.\n\nTerminations: vents must be properly terminated per CSA B149.1 requirements. Category IV furnace manufacturers allow through-the-roof or sidewall terminations. Sidewall venting easier for builders and equipment installers (saves time, materials, labour, interior living space by avoiding flue chases) in both new construction and renovations. These inherent advantages made sidewall venting increasingly popular in Canada. Caution must be used when designing and installing sidewall vents to ensure exhaust dissipated away from building and occupants. Significant chance of frost and ice buildup on adjacent building if vent not located correctly. If frost and ice buildup occur, moisture absorption within building materials not noticeable immediately but over long period can have big impact on durability.\n\nRooftop termination shows preferred method for Category IV appliance. Combustion air intake minimum 12 inches (300 mm) above anticipated snow level, maximum 24 inches (600 mm) above roof level. 4 3/4 inch (115 mm) for 2 inch pipe, 7 3/8 inch (190 mm) for 3 inch pipe. Maximum 18 inches (450 mm) separation. Preferred method is two small roof openings as opposed to one larger one due to ease of sealing.\n\nSidewall termination shows vent elbow perpendicular to side wall, minimum 24 inch (600 mm) clearance to any overhang, 12 inch (300 mm) between bottom of intake and bottom of vent, minimum 12 inch (300 mm) above anticipated snow level. Different configurations for installation below or above anticipated snow level.\n\nApplication and approval: some municipalities require heat-loss calculation accompany application for building permit for new building. Heat-loss calculations can be done by gas technician/fitter if trained in this practice. Some jurisdictions require certificate proving competency in heat-loss/heat-gain calculations. Gas technician/fitter can take additional third-party training to receive this certification.\n\nFurnace must be installed per codes unless AHJ has approved alteration. Appliance may only be used for purpose it was made for. Must be installed and used per manufacturer specifications and suitable for type and pressure of gas available. Appliance must be certified by recognized certification organization (e.g., CSA Group). Confirm with AHJ that furnace has acceptable certification mark (e.g., Technical Safety BC issued directive titled \"Approved certification marks for gas appliances\" to help gas technicians/fitters). Appliance may need to be converted for another type of gas. In some jurisdictions, before appliance using gas delivered by pipeline is activated, gas technician/fitter must notify distributor (natural gas utility or propane distributor) of appliance type and address where appliance being installed.\n\nSizing forced-air furnace: as part of correctly sizing, gas technician/fitter must understand how heat is transferred and rate of transfer. Otherwise system may be undersized (lead to problems in heating areas), oversized (create inefficient energy usage), or directed to incorrect areas (create uneven heating). Heat loss or gain can vary considerably during day. Temperature that feels comfortable when people active may not feel comfortable when resting.\n\nHeat loss and heat gain: heat is form of energy so cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred. Many factors contribute including building materials, infiltration factors, number of building occupants and activities, and capacity of heating and cooling equipment being used. Calculation of heat loss and gain and requirements for heat transfer in various building types discussed in detail in Air handling unit.\n\nReplacing various types of furnaces: gas technician/fitter usually required to change furnace currently in operation rather than redesign whole system. Can involve replacing electric furnace with gas furnace, oil-burning furnace with gas furnace, or older gas furnace with more efficient furnace. In these three cases, system must be sized so replacement furnace operates properly.\n\nBefore replacing electric, oil-fired, or older gas-fired furnace with higher-efficiency gas furnace, heat-loss calculation must be done. Important as old furnace may not have been sized properly or home may have been upgraded after furnace installed. Heat-loss calculations must be completed per relevant codes and standards using acceptable methods of practice as recognized by AHJ.\n\nWhen updating to more efficient furnace, gas technician/fitter needs to evaluate other gas-fired appliances that may be dependent on existing furnace system for venting. These can include Type B vented hot-water tanks and other equipment related to home HVAC system. For example, Type B vented hot-water tank vent combined with furnace vent must be evaluated after new furnace installed to determine whether venting changes required to accommodate \"orphaned\" domestic hot-water tank. After checking size of vent, may be determined existing old common vent is oversized and needs to be resized, typically by installing liner system.\n\nStartup and commissioning: processes through which new furnace system is verified and adjusted so performs per manufacturer and owner requirements. Beyond visual inspection of components, series of tests should be completed with help of instrumentation. Results of testing compared against acceptable values (often manufacturer-specified) to calibrate new furnace. Results recorded on commissioning checklist and provided to homeowner. Specific guidance on procedures and equipment needed for commissioning provided in HRAI and TECA documentation.\n\nSimplified commissioning process includes at least: inspect individual system components, check manifold gas pressure to confirm meets manufacturer's nameplate value, check firing rate of furnace by \"clocking the meter\" (high-firing rate must not be outside 10% of rated Btu/h input), calculate furnace temperature rise by measuring air temperature of supply and return air respectively (confirm temperature rise lies within manufacturer's stated tolerance, e.g., measure temperature rise on two-stage gas-valve furnace at both high fire and low fire, if required adjustment can be made to blower speed to change temperature rise, older low-efficiency and medium-efficiency furnaces had single-speed or multi-speed motors driving blower but modern high-efficiency furnaces use variable speed technology), complete ESP test and confirm tested value aligned with HRAI recommendations or TECA (complete ductwork modifications as necessary), set up and program thermostat to achieve optimal furnace operation and customer comfort (newer digital thermostats can have several dozen options requiring decisions from homeowner), review operation and maintenance requirements of furnace with homeowner (always provide homeowner with all furnace-related documentation and inform of its location e.g., furnace pocket once commissioned - this is CSA B149.1 requirement), document all testing information on commissioning checklist and record any outstanding issues for follow-up with homeowner.\n\nSample diagram used with furnace commissioning worksheet shows four key measurements: 1) Gas line and manifold pressure (gas meter to gas line), 2) Clocking the meter, 3) Temperature rise (T1 return, T2 supply), 4) External static pressure test.",

          "content": "Chapter 2 covers servicing procedures for forced-air heating systems. Check gas piping to furnace: all gas-piping fittings and connections should be checked by approved method such as combustible-gas leak detector, chloride-free soap and water, or equivalent non-flammable solution. Repair or replace any part(s) of system found defective.\n\nClean/replace air filter(s): remove air filter and clean or replace as required. When replacing filters consult manufacturer literature as some high-efficiency filters have high pressure drop which can be beyond manufacturer limitations. Many furnace manufacturers have filter chart in literature specifying size and type of filter required. Some furnaces may contain more than one filter.\n\nConvert gas valve: if furnace needs conversion from natural gas to propane or propane to natural gas, gas technician/fitter needs to change orifices and manifold pressure. Orifices at burners need to be resized based on which fuel used. If furnace ignition system includes pilot, orifice in this assembly needs to be changed as well. Propane orifices are smaller than natural gas orifices and, if not supplied by manufacturer, can be sized using Table I.3 of CSA B149.1. If applicable, manufacturer includes method to change combination gas valve outlet pressure (manifold pressure), usually as simple as replacing spring in servo-regulator. Once conversion completed, gas technician/fitter must check input rate and temperature rise to ensure furnace operating within design parameters.\n\nCheck and adjust manifold gas pressure: to check manifold pressure in furnace, first make sure power is off. Turn off gas supply at furnace and remove plug from gas valve outlet pressure tap (manifold pressure tap). Connect manometer or gauge to pressure tap, turn on gas supply, and energize furnace calling for heat. Once furnace operating, read pressure on gauge or manometer. Check rating plate of appliance or manufacturer instructions for particular furnace to determine recommended manifold pressure. If furnace has two-stage gas valve, check manifold pressure at both low and high fires. Can typically make adjustments to manifold pressure on gas valve as necessary by following installation and operation instructions.\n\nTo obtain accurate manifold pressure measurement on sealed combustion appliance, manifold pressure must be referenced to burner box since burner box pressure tap equalizes gas-valve pressure regulator. To do so, install tee and section of tube (field supplied) in tubing between tee coming from burner box tube and gas valve manifold pressure measurement fitting. This tube and tee in addition to tube attached to gas valve pressure tap on outlet side of gas valve. Set-up method for manifold pressure test shows slope gauge connects to burner box pressure hose with field supplied barb fitting on gas valve to attach hose.\n\nClock appliance to verify correct input: for information on clocking refer to Meters section in Pressure regulators, overpressure protection, meters, and fuel containers unit.\n\nConfirm adequate combustion air supply: gas technician/fitter may work on any type or category of furnace so understanding of combustion air requirements essential. Modern direct-vent sealed-combustion appliances take air directly from outdoors to combustion chamber and vent directly to outdoors. These furnaces must have air supply and venting sized and installed per manufacturer literature. Older natural-draft appliances must be supplied with combustion, excess, and (if required) dilution air. This air supply sized by Clauses 8.2, 8.3, and 8.4 of CSA B149.1. May be necessary to check sizing of combustion-air supply (pipe or duct) of existing appliance if combustion analysis indicates concerns with combustion process. Combustion air pipes or ducts can become blocked or damaged at any time so thorough check of entire system required during annual servicing.\n\nInspect and clean heat exchanger: heat exchanger is any device that transfers energy from one substance to another without allowing two substances to mix. High-efficiency furnaces make use of two heat exchangers: primary heat exchanger and secondary heat exchanger. Primary heat exchanger in typical gas-fired forced-air furnace is clam-type curved heat exchanger. This heat exchanger consists of several clams. Each clam consists of two curved sheets of metal welded together with space in middle. There is opening at bottom of clam for gas burner and opening at top for flue gas to escape. Number of clams joined together to make up heat exchanger.\n\nHeat exchanger curved to protect from damage as expands and contracts with changing temperatures. This also allows more surface to be presented to supply air and does not interfere with flow of air as heat exchanger expands or contracts. Most heat exchangers made of stainless steel or aluminized steel and normally coated with vitreous enamel to provide corrosion resistance. Heat exchanger must be made of durable material so does not crack. If cracks, products of combustion (which can be toxic) mix with supply air causing dangerous situation in building.\n\nMost heat exchangers should cause air temperature rise of between 45 °F (25 °C) and 100 °F (56 °C). Temperature rises on newer high-efficiency furnace models usually lower than on standard or mid-efficiency units. Always check manufacturer specifications for temperature rise. Secondary heat exchanger is condensing heat exchanger used to draw off heat from combustion products vented from primary heat exchanger.\n\nIn furnace using only one heat exchanger, lot of heat lost when flue gas vented out of system (vent piping of these systems feels hot). In high-efficiency furnace, heat normally lost is transferred to return air. In high-efficiency furnace, fuel gas ignited in primary heat exchanger. This combustion heats primary heat exchanger. Hot flue gas then drawn through primary heat exchanger into secondary heat exchanger. Warm flue gas transfers heat to secondary heat exchanger by giving off more of its heat and condensing water vapours in products of combustion. When gas condenses gives off heat (latent heat). Secondary heat exchanger needs to be properly drained of condensate formed in it.\n\nMost heat of combustion process now transferred to heat exchangers and flue gas no longer has enough energy to vent naturally to atmosphere. Power venter then used to vent flue gas. Return air passes first over secondary heat exchanger where heated. This warm air then passes over primary heat exchanger and further heated. Because air already warm when passes over primary heat exchanger, condensation does not take place in this heat exchanger. This extends lifetime of primary heat exchanger. Finally, heated air ducted to areas in building needing warmth. In this way two heat exchangers work together to transfer most heat given off in combustion process to return air. Efficiencies greater than 90% can be achieved using this process.\n\nAppliance heat exchangers require regular inspection and maintenance to operate safely and efficiently. If gas technician/fitter suspects heat exchanger is compromised, thorough investigation must be done to ensure safety of occupants. Recommended steps to inspect furnace's heat exchanger:\n\nLook for flame disturbances: start furnace and observe any changes in flame pattern as circulating air blower starts operating. Look for floating flames, flame rollout, or flame distortion. These conditions indicate possible split seam, open crack, severe deterioration of heat exchanger or gasketing material, or physical separation of connected parts. If flame disturbance occurs after blower comes on, good indication problem may exist in lower portion of heat exchanger (upflow furnace).\n\nMeasure CO levels in airstream: with furnace operating, measure CO level in return air duct near furnace and record value. Next measure CO level in supply ducting leaving furnace. Record this value. If no measurable difference in CO level in return and supply airstreams, likely furnace not leaking CO into airstream. If CO in supply air ducting greater than CO in return air, likely furnace supplying CO through heat exchanger.\n\nMeasure O2 levels in vent: induced-draft furnaces less likely to leak products of combustion into circulating air stream than natural-draft furnace due to negative pressure inside heat exchanger created by inducer fan. Insert flue gas analyzer probe into vent. Observe O2 level. If significant increase occurs when circulating fan energized, possible heat exchanger is damaged.\n\nVisually inspect heat exchanger: occasionally holes formed by rust or cracks can be seen with eye or with aid of mirror, but often only 20% of total surface of heat exchanger visible to view even with mirror once furnace installed. Some holes or cracks visible only when thermal expansion causes cracks to open (can be difficult to observe when furnace operating). If furnace fails any of three preceding steps, careful attention should be paid to visual inspection. This may require removal of circulating fan to see bottom of heat exchanger and cutting access door into supply plenum to see top of heat exchanger. Pay particular attention to welds, seams, joints, and discoloured spots on heat exchanger(s). If burners removed, flashlight may be directed into each heat exchanger and visually inspected from outside looking for signs of light. If available, inspection camera can be inserted into each heat exchanger.\n\nClause 4.21 of CSA B149.1 lists requirements that must be followed if heat exchanger found defective in dwelling. It also provides provisions to temporarily repair heat exchanger. After inspection of heat exchanger and its determination to be in good operational condition, may require cleaning. Always consult manufacturer instructions for cleaning procedures. Never use wire brush to clean outside of heat exchanger as this damages exchanger.\n\nCleaning primary heat exchanger: check for dirt in upper part of heat exchanger with flashlight and mirror, attach exhaust pipe from vacuum to flue outlet of heat exchanger and blow any dirt at top of exchanger to bottom burner area, use wire brush to clean bottom of heat exchanger and then vacuum cleaner to remove all loose dirt, use soft brush to clean outside of heat exchanger.\n\nCleaning secondary heat exchanger: blocked secondary coil surface may cause furnace to cycle on and off on high-limit control and reduce furnace heating effectiveness and efficiency. Clean outside of secondary heat exchanger using soft brush. To clean inside of secondary heat exchanger: remove it from casing, plug either inlet or outlet pipe, fill heat exchanger with hot water and plug other pipe, shake vigorously and drain exchanger, finally flush exchanger with hard stream of water.\n\nReassembly: ensure burner assembly put back together properly after cleaning and everything has been reconnected. Once furnace reassembled perform operational check on furnace and flue-gas analysis.\n\nObserve operation of vent damper if equipped: automatic vent-damper devices used to reduce heat loss up vent on mid-efficiency appliances. Although popular on boilers because of large mass, some furnace manufacturers install these components on furnaces. They open when burner fires and close during off cycle. Although these dampers used for improving efficiency of conventional-vented, standard, and mid-efficiency furnaces, must be approved. Dampers neither needed nor used on high-efficiency furnaces.\n\nAutomatic vent dampers located downstream of draft hood. Two methods of operation: electrical (electricity to open/close), thermal (heat of vent gas to open). On call for heat damper automatically opens and burner lights. When heating cycle ends burner turns off and damper automatically closes. Heating system efficiency increased because closed damper reduces loss of residual appliance heat and heated room air through draft diverter.\n\nTo check operation of damper: turn on power supply, if using thermostat set heat anticipator at 0.13 A, set thermostat or controller to 10 °F (6 °C) above room temperature to call for heat, check damper opens before gas valve opens and pilot or main burner ignites, turn thermostat or controller at 10 °F (6 °C) below room temperature and check damper closes, cycle heating system at least three times using thermostat or controller to assure system operating safely. Explain to homeowner that yearly inspection by trained experienced service technician necessary for safe efficient operation of vent damper and heating system. Between service calls homeowner should check for deterioration from corrosion or other sources.\n\nInspect condensate drain system if applicable: condensing furnaces have several condensate drain points within cabinet of appliance as well as externally on vents and piping to DWV system. Some installation also includes accessory equipment such as neutralizers and pumps. All piping, tubing, and accessory equipment need to be inspected and cleaned/repaired as necessary.\n\nSince some older DWV piping cannot accommodate low pH (high acidity) associated with condensate, some municipalities require condensate from furnaces to be passed through pH neutralizer prior to entering drain network. These neutralizer cartridges require recharging with new pellets to keep working at peak levels. Make sure to properly size neutralizer for capacity of condensate that can be produced by appliance. Failure to size neutralizer correctly creates problems for safe and efficient operation of appliance. Always best to check with AHJ to determine neutralizer requirements.\n\nCondensate pump may be required if lowest drain point on appliance cannot drain by gravity to DWV system. Corrosion-resistant condensate pump must be used and must be installed with provisions to prevent winter freeze-up of condensate drain line. Frozen condensate blocks drains resulting in possible furnace shutdown if pump has high-level alarm interlocked with furnace control system. Option to prevent freezing of drain lines is to install self-regulating or thermostatically controlled heat tape.\n\nFlexible condensate tubing used for internal drains and external drains (outside furnace cabinet) need to be rigid PVC piping to maintain grade to DWV system. Condensate pumps and acid neutralizer can be sold separately or combined into one unit (NeutraPump condensate neutralization tank with pump).",

Table 3-2 shows Furnace airflow (CFM) vs. external static pressure (INS. w.g.) for various models. Speed taps include 4-HIGH-Black, 3-MED. HIGH-Blue, 2-MED. LOW-Yellow, 1-LOW-Red. External static pressure ranges from 0.10 to 0.90 INS. w.g. Various furnace models listed include UC1-B040A9241A, UC1-B060A9361A, UC1-B080A9421A, UC1-B100A9281A, UC1-B100A9601A, UC1-B120A9601A with corresponding CFM values for each static pressure level and speed tap.\n\nAfter initial indoor blower speed selected and furnace operational, gas technician/fitter should perform ESP test to ensure appliance operating within temperature rise and ESP specifications. Test procedure for acquiring ESP reading described in Air handling unit. Once indoor blower speed finalized, IFC module controls indoor blower. Blower start usually fixed at approximately 45 sec after ignition. Fan-off period field-selectable via user-interface menu and can include times such as 60, 100, 140, or 180 sec (factory setting usually approximately 100 sec). For heating mode, blower speed preset to be approximately 50% of cooling speed but could have user-determined selectable range. This procedure usually same whether furnace uses PSC or ECM motor but always check manufacturer's literature.\n\nControl and safety circuits: several electrical circuits in forced-air furnace used to control furnace as well as make safe to operate. Many controls detailed in other units. Following content focuses on application of controls as applies to furnaces.\n\nThermostats: thermostat used to control operation of furnace. Simplest thermostat measures room temperature and starts and stops burner so temperature maintained at set level. Needs to be well-placed so furnace operates correctly. Location: thermostat must be placed so senses average room temperature, not exposed to hot or cold drafts or hot or cold spots on wall, must be located so can best sense average temperature of entire room (e.g., on inside wall not too low down or behind objects on bookcase). Since thermostat uses mercury switch must be properly levelled when mounted and placed in area free from vibration.\n\nHeating-cooling thermostat: when heating and cooling combined for year-round comfort, impractical to use separate thermostat for each. Therefore two combined into one heating-cooling thermostat. Bulk and expense of two separate bimetal coils (one for heating one for cooling) avoided when two mercury bulbs mounted on same bimetal coil. Heating and cooling anticipators mounted near coil. Single transformer used. Two mercury bulbs can be combined into one: done by using one common electrode, one heating electrode, and one cooling electrode. When bulb tilted in one direction closes heating contacts, in other direction cooling contacts closed.\n\nSystem switches: unless switch provided in heating-cooling thermostat, thermostat continuously switches back and forth from heating to cooling. In effect heating and cooling fight battle with each other. Switch provides means to throw control to cooling while disconnecting heating circuit. Likewise when switch moved to heating, switch connects heating components while electrically isolating cooling circuit. When switch in centre \"off\" position, neither heating nor cooling circuits energized.\n\nMany thermostats (heating, cooling, or combination) equipped with fan switch. Purpose of this switch to allow homeowner to control blower operation independently of \"cool-off-heat\" switch. When fan switch at \"auto\" blower runs only when call for heating or cooling, when thermostat satisfied blower shuts off. Continuous blower position normally marked \"on\", when this switch turned to \"on\" blower runs all time.\n\nAnticipator improves comfort control of furnace.\n\nProgrammable thermostats: electronic programmable thermostats used on modern high-efficiency furnaces. They are solid-state or microprocessor boards that do not use mercury switches and do not require heat anticipation. Some models even operate wirelessly making for easier installation. Gas technician/fitter needs to field wire and set up thermostat for specific furnace application.\n\nSome applications: single-stage furnace using single-stage thermostat, single-stage furnace combined with single-stage cooling using single-stage thermostat, two-stage furnace combined with single-stage cooling using single-stage thermostat, two-stage furnace combined with single-stage cooling using two-stage thermostat, two-stage furnace combined with two-stage cooling using two-stage thermostat, twinning two single-stage furnaces using single-stage thermostat, modulating furnace using smart thermostat, modulating furnace combined with single-speed cooling, modulating furnace combined with heat pump, Wi-Fi-enabled programmable thermostat with remote monitor and control of heating and cooling system.\n\nField wiring must match specific combination of furnace, thermostat, and any other optional equipment. Furnace manufacturer's literature, thermostat manufacturer's literature, and other equipment literature must all be consulted during setup of thermostat. Installation, setup, and operation of programmable thermostats involve several programming steps and must be done per manufacturer instructions. To complete thermostat setup follow prompts on screen to select appropriate options.\n\nMercury notice: if this product replacing control containing mercury in sealed tube, do not place old control in trash. Contact HRAI Thermostat Recovery Program for recycling instructions in your area.\n\nGas valves: operation of gas valves in gas-fired appliances detailed in Controls: Fundamentals unit. Same principles used in forced-air furnaces. In most cases in central furnaces gas valve forms part of combination control. Main gas valve controlled by thermostat. On call for heat coil energized, main gas valve opens, and main burner ignites. When circuit to coil opened, coil de-energizes and valve closes.\n\nLimit and roll-out switches: number of different switches used in furnaces as safety checks. Limit or roll-out switch essentially bimetal element placed in area where temperature must be sensed. Switch normally in closed position and connected in control circuit in series with gas valve. As temperature rises bimetal bends or capillary expands until at some point breaks electrical contact to open circuit. Most limit and roll-out switches reset automatically as cool down but some need to be manually reset. Some general reasons for limit switches functioning to open circuit and shut down burner: faulty fuel valve, broken blower belt, blocked air filter, or faulty blower motor. If limit switch causes furnace to shut down check must be made for reason and problem fixed.\n\nHigh-limit switch: safety device used to shut burner off if outlet air overheats. Calibrated by manufacturer. Prevents air leaving furnace from exceeding set temperature limit. High-limit switch in normally closed position. These switches may use either bimetal sensing element or capillary fluid-filled sensing element (both perform same function). Two main types: standalone safety limit switch and combination fan and limit switch.\n\nStandalone safety limit switch: purely safety switch used to shut down burner if supply air in plenum exceeds certain set temperature, normally about 200 °F (93 °C). When this type of limit switch used, separate switch controls operation of fan.\n\nCombination fan and limit switch: limit set pointer on limit control that controls high-limit switch preset by manufacturer and must not be adjusted. Limit switches act as safety controls to prevent runaway temperatures that can cause fire hazard. If limit control functions to shut off burner, condition should be assessed to determine cause and appropriate corrective action taken.\n\nSecondary limit control: downflow and horizontal furnaces make use of secondary limit controls (sometimes called auxiliary limit controls). Secondary limit control protects fan motor on top of unit from damage. When fan off heat rises to top of furnace. High-limit switch does not detect this heat so additional switch used to protect motor and air filters from this rising heat. This condition may occur if fan fails or if reversed airflow condition. Location: secondary limit control installed above heat exchanger near or in supply air inlet. Operation: secondary limit switch connected in series with high-limit switch. If temperature at this limit switch rises above set level switch opens and burners shut down. Typically secondary limit switch set to open at point below high-limit switch setting.\n\nExhaust limit switch: used to shut down burner if temperature of flue gas exceeds certain limit. May happen if soot buildup inside heat exchangers or lint buildup on secondary heat exchanger. This prevents heat transfer from heat exchangers. If this case then heat exchangers must be cleaned. Location: exhaust limit switch typically located on exhaust blower housing. Operation: exhaust limit switch in normally closed position. When temperature rises above set limit switch opens and gas valve closes shutting burner down. Switch resets itself when temperature falls below set level.\n\nRoll-out switch: used to sense problems in flow of combustion products. These problems may be caused by blockages in heat exchangers and flue or may be failure of combustion air blower or exhaust blower to function properly which can lead to flame rollout. If flame rollout sensed switch causes burner to shut down. If this occurred blockages must be removed and cause of problem corrected. Location: roll-out switch located on burner shield. Operation: roll-out switch is normally closed snap-disc-type switch or capillary-type switch. When high temperatures sensed switch opens breaking contact with burner control system. Once system drops below set temperature switch may have to be manually reset depending on model of furnace. Some roll-out switches reset automatically. Flame-rollout safety switch must never be jumped. If switch does shut furnace down check must be made for reason of shutdown.\n\nVent-outlet pressure switches: vent-outlet pressure switch used to shut burner down if blockage of some form in vent outlet or internal flue-gas passages. Also shuts burner down if failure of combustion air fan or motor. If switch shut burner down blockages must be removed or combustion air fan or motor fixed or replaced. Location: vent-outlet pressure switch normally located at appliance flue outlet. Operation: vent-outlet pressure switch connected in series to thermostat circuit. In furnace without power venter switch in normally closed position. If blockage in exhaust outlet pipe pressure in vent outlet rises and pressure switch opens (opens thermostat circuit and closes gas valve). If mechanical draft being used switch in normally open position. When call for heat mechanical-draft blower motor activates and switch closes. If mechanical draft fails switch opens shutting burner down. As with other types of furnaces if blockage sensed in exhaust outlet pipe shuts down furnace as well as mechanical-draft blower motor. Mechanical-draft blower motor equipped with differential pressure switch. If required pressure differential not sensed switch closes and burner cannot operate because switch interlocked with burner. Switch automatically resets when blockage removed. Sometimes temperature switch mounted in draft hood used to perform same purpose as pressure switch.\n\nCombustion safety controls: combustion safety control used to shut down burner if burner malfunctions. Combustion safety control monitors firing to make sure ignition occurs and flame remains on when call for heat.\n\nTroubleshooting: gas technician/fitter must be able to successfully troubleshoot electrical problems to fix forced-air furnace. To do this necessary to be able to read electrical-wiring diagrams. Testing supply voltage, amperage draw, 24-V systems, thermocouple systems, and flame rectification detailed in Basic electricity for gas-fired equipment and Controls: Fundamentals units. Faults with mechanical parts of furnace may impact electrical components and faults with electrical components of furnace may impact mechanical parts. Gas technician/fitter must take this into account when troubleshooting furnace.\n\nTroubleshooting electrical problems technique: observe furnace and compare to customer's description of problem, always read electrical drawing to determine sequence of operations, determine electrical circuit giving problem and test for voltage at its load, work around circuit with voltage tests to locate problem, double-check findings with secondary check against known normal values of resistance, pressure, temperature, etc. to identify device not acting normally, replace device and observe operation.\n\nGeneral faults corrected using Table 3-3. Low gas pressure (pilot goes out when main burner valve energized, check supply and piping system). Open thermostat (no noise or action from furnace, check for loose connections or burned heat anticipator, transformer warm, fan comes on when manual switch activated, replace if necessary). Inoperable draft-inducer motor (motor warm, slight humming sound, no other action, check for obstruction or low voltage, replace). Open transformer winding (transformer cool, fan comes on when manual fan switch activated, check with ohmmeter, determine cause of failure). High-limit open (transformer cool, fan comes on when manual fan switch activated, replace). High-limit inoperable when fan fails (burners do not shut off when fan disabled, check electrical connections, replace if necessary). Unit cycles off high-limit (fan running constantly, correct airflow problem, burners cycle on-off and open high-limit switch verified with voltage test at limit control, check for oversized furnace or undersized ductwork). Roll-out or spillage switch activated (symptoms depend on manufacturer's electrical design, determine cause of rollout). Erratic fan cycling (fan cycles on-off during burn period or runs or both for very short period after burners deactivate or fan restarts after one complete cycle, set fan-off setting so plenum temperature 90 to 100 °F/32 to 38 °C, if at shutdown set fan-on temperature to 50 °F/28 °C above fan-off temperature).\n\nMost furnace manufacturers offer troubleshooting solutions in literature. Example of troubleshooting flow chart shows getting started: check if high voltage power supplied to unit (if not repair high voltage connection to unit), close and hold door switch, check if IFC LED flashing (if not replace IFC), check if connections and wiring in working condition (if not repair connections), check if 24VAC low voltage present from transformer and fuse good (if not repair low voltage wiring, replace transformer, or fuse as needed), see fault LED flash codes page for specific flash code.\n\nAssignment questions cover: combination control normal differential setting approximately 25 °F (14 °C), mid-efficiency furnace fan shuts off when fan control cools down enough to open circuit under normal operating conditions, auxiliary limit control found on horizontal or downflow furnaces, not all roll-out switches require manual reset (some automatic), temperature rise calculation (return air 70 °F + temperature rise 75 °F = supply temperature 145 °F), pressure switch designed to cause burner shutdown if blockage in vent, airflow calculation example (furnace with rated input 60 000 Btu/h, 95% efficient, temperature rise 40 to 60 °F), IFC receives 24 V ac from thermostat circuit on call for heat, indoor-blower circuit energized via IFC using electronic time delay, typical modulating furnace range between 40 and 100% of capacity, ESP test recommended after retrofitting to confirm operating within temperature rise limits, ESP limits, and not overfiring.",

Typically, the supply and return air plenums are the sheet metal components directly adjacent to the furnace\nSpecial venting system\nA venting system certified with the appliance and either supplied or specified by the appliance manufacturer\nThermal Environmental Comfort Association\nTECA\nA not-for-profit society with a focus on training in the HVACR industries\nULC S636 standard\nS636\nUnderwriters Laboratories of Canada Standard for Type BH gas venting systems\nMajor Furnace Components\nBurner and Control Devices\nThe components responsible for igniting and regulating the gas flow to create controlled combustion within the furnace.\nCombustion Chamber\nThe enclosed area where the burning of fuel occurs, designed to contain and direct the heat produced.\nHeat Exchanger\nThe component that transfers heat from the combustion gases to the air that circulates through the home.\nBlower Compartment\nContains the fan that moves air through the furnace and ductwork system to distribute heated air throughout the building.\nMajor Furnace Classifications\nHigh Boy\nTall, upright furnaces that can be configured as up-flow or down-flow units.\nLow Boy\nShorter furnaces with components arranged horizontally, designed for spaces with height limitations.\nHorizontal\nFurnaces designed to be installed in a horizontal position, often used in crawl spaces or attics.\nThe end user requirements and the installation site determine the choice of furnace type. Each classification has specific airflow patterns and installation requirements.\nHigh Boy Up-Flow Furnace\nReturn Air Entry\nReturn air enters the furnace either at the bottom, rear, or one of the sides, depending on where the furnace is located\nBlower Operation\nThe blower is mounted beneath the heat exchanger and forces the return air up over the heat exchanger\nHeated Air Distribution\nThe heated air then leaves through the top of the furnace\nThe high boy up-flow furnace is the most popular gas-fired furnace and is usually located in basements, although it may also be located in first floor utility rooms.\nHigh Boy Down-Flow Furnace\nReturn Air Entry\nReturn air enters the top of the furnace and is forced down over the heat exchanger\nHeat Exchange\nAir passes over the heat exchanger, gaining thermal energy from the combustion process\nHeated Air Distribution\nThe heated air is then blown out the bottom of the furnace\nThese furnaces have an additional limit switch placed above the heat exchanger for sensing the rising warm air and to turn the burner off. If the furnace did not have this switch, the air filter and/or motor would quickly overheat.\nDown-Flow Furnace Installation Note\nInstallation Caution\nSome down-flow furnaces have been certified for installation on a non-combustible floor only.\nCombustible Flooring\nThese furnaces should not be installed on combustible flooring unless installed on a special base that has been specifically certified for this purpose.\nThe high boy down-flow furnace is also known as the high boy counter-flow furnace. These furnaces are normally installed in first floor utility rooms or slab constructed buildings. The air is distributed through crawl spaces.\nLow Boy Forced-Air Furnace\nAir Intake\nThe blower pulls in air through the top of the furnace\nHeat Exchange\nThe blower pushes air over the heat exchanger\nAir Distribution\nThe heated air then leaves through the top of the furnace\nLow boy forced-air furnaces are used mainly in basements. In this type of low boy furnace, the blower is placed next to the heat exchanger. The gas-fired low boy furnace design is fast disappearing from the marketplace since new compact high-boy designs can accommodate the height spacing left behind from the removal of an old low boy furnace.\nHorizontal Forced-Air Furnace\nThe horizontal forced-air furnace is used in areas where there is limited head room, or where it can be suspended from the ceiling and be out of the way. They are often used in automotive garages, crawl spaces, and attics.\nFlexible Configuration\nThe components in a horizontal furnace can often be rearranged so that the air can move from left to right or from right to left.\nSpace Efficiency\nDesigned specifically for installation in areas with height restrictions where vertical furnaces cannot fit.\nMulti-Position Forced-Air Furnace\nSome furnaces are designed so they can be installed in any one of several positions. The orientation of the components will change as the position changes.\nUpflow Configuration\nAir enters at the bottom and exits at the top, ideal for basement installations.\nDownflow Configuration\nAir enters at the top and exits at the bottom, suitable for installations on main floors or in closets.\nHorizontal Configuration\nAir flows horizontally through the unit, perfect for attics, crawlspaces, or other areas with limited headroom.\nFurnace Efficiency Classifications\nConventional/Low Efficiency\nBelow 78% efficient\nMedium/Mid Efficiency\n78% to 89% efficient\nHigh Efficiency/Condensing\n90% efficient and above\nEnergy Star\n95% efficient and above\nNatural Resources Canada (NRCan) Energy Efficiency regulations mandate the efficiency of furnaces. Since 2010, the minimum AFUE efficiency for residential furnaces (65.92kW/225,000 Btu/h using single-phase electric current) has been 90%. Although there are furnaces installed with different efficiencies, only high-efficiency furnaces are currently manufactured and sold in Canada.\nLow-Efficiency Furnace Characteristics\nStanding Pilot\nContinuously burning pilot light that wastes energy when heating is not required\nNatural-Draft Burners\nRely on the natural rise of hot gases for combustion air flow\nDraft Hoods\nControl the draft influence on the combustion chamber\nHigh Flue Temperatures\nTemperatures well above the dew point ensure no condensation in heat exchanger or venting\nThese models represent most central furnaces sold prior to the mid-1980s. They typically had a belt-drive blower assembly and electro-mechanical type safety and operating controls.\nMid-Efficiency Furnace Characteristics\nElectronic Ignition\nReplaced standing pilots, requiring a control module (circuit board) for operation\nRedesigned Heat Exchanger\nConstructed of thinner material with multiple passes for better heat transfer\nDraft-Inducing Fan\nHelps draw the products of combustion from the burner to the venting system\nEfficiency Range\nGenerally achieve AFUEs of 78-82%\nHigh-Efficiency Furnace Characteristics\nCondensing Technology\nProducts of combustion are purposely cooled below the dew point by advanced heat transfer methods\nDual Heat Exchangers\nUtilizes primary and secondary heat exchangers for maximum efficiency\nCondensate Management\nRequires proper drainage systems for the acidic condensate produced\nHigh AFUE Rating\nEfficiency levels well into the 90% range\nSince January 1st, 2012, all gas-fired furnaces sold in Canada are required to be high efficiency (90% and above) as determined by the AFUE testing guidelines.\nFurnace Categories\nCategory\nVent Static Pressure\nFlue Loss\nType and Efficiency\nCategory I\nNon-positive (zero or negative)\nNot less than 17% (maximum 83% efficient)\nMedium-efficiency furnaces with draft hood-equipped or fan-assisted for venting into Type B vents\nCategory II\nNon-positive (zero or negative)\nLess than 17% (84% or greater efficiency)\nHigh-efficiency furnaces (90-98%) with condensation that must be properly disposed\nCategory III\nPositive\nNot less than 17% (maximum 83% efficient)\nMost are medium-efficiency furnaces\nCategory IV\nPositive\nLess than 17% (84% or greater efficiency)\nHigh-efficiency furnaces (90-98%) with condensation that must b",
