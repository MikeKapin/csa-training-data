          "content": "Chapter 1 covers construction heaters including propane cylinder selection and connection. POL fittings are turned counterclockwise into cylinder threads and tightened with a wrench. The regulator should be positioned so the hose leaving it is horizontal, protecting the vent from weather. All connections must be checked for leaks using a leak detector or soap solution. The propane cylinder should always be kept upright to prevent liquid propane from flowing to the heater.\n\nRadiant construction heaters use infrared heat which minimizes moisture buildup within the building under construction and helps to dry out materials and concrete. An infrared construction heater can radiate 250,000 Btu/h at 360 °F heat over a 5000 ft² area. Natural gas heater models are popular with construction rental companies as they combine benefits with consistent fuel supply. These heaters can be disconnected when construction is finalized and the furnace then connected to the meter supply. Gas utility companies have policies and procedures for connection, activation, and meter coordination.\n\nIndirect-fired heaters are used for applications that call for clean air free from moisture and contaminated fumes. They are available as dual-fuel heaters operating on propane and natural gas. To change fuels, a selector valve must be turned to its proper position and the safety lock engaged. Units range from approximately 400,000 Btu/h to much larger skid-mounted units with millions of Btu/h capacity. Flexible ducting is used to bring warm air into the building and may also be used to return air to the heater. The vent outlet pipe requires a minimum of 2 ft vertical flue pipe. For indoor installations, the vent must terminate outdoors within the maximum length limitations specified by the manufacturer.\n\nMaintenance is necessary to maintain reliable performance. Never service a heater while it is plugged in, connected to a gas supply, operating, or hot as this creates risk of severe burns and electrical shock. General maintenance steps include: keeping the heater clean with a damp cloth and household cleaners; inspecting the heater before each use; visually checking cords, connectors, wiring, conduit, heater shell, and control box; inspecting the hose/regulator assembly before each use; keeping the inside free from combustibles and foreign objects; and cleaning fan blades each season or as needed.\n\nExtensive maintenance includes blowing the outside of the unit with compressed air to remove accumulated dust, blowing the entire burner face moving back and forth until all dust is dislodged from the grid screen, and blowing through the venturi starting from the control end. Clean the orifice, clean the thermocouple lead, and clean the flame rod and insulator with soap and water or solvent. Clean the spark plug with solvent and check the spark gap. Clean the inside of the control box with a dry cloth or compressed air (do not use any liquid or aerosol spray cleaners). Check the motor and oil (and add if required), check the tightness of the set screw on the fan motor, and run the heater to check for fan vibration.",

          "content": "Chapter 2 covers fireplaces and their components. Box burners are made of sheet metal that is slotted or punched to form ports and then bent into a box shape. The holes and slots can be arranged to create a specific flame pattern. After being bent into a box shape, the box seams are made gastight. Box burners have an air shutter attached or a separate venturi tube.\n\nCeramic-tile burners consist of a ceramic tile mounted in a sheet metal box. The ceramic tile has many small ports arranged in a very uniform pattern. The box holds the ceramic tile and provides a space into which the gas and primary air mixture flow. The ceramic tile is brittle and can crack. Bending or prying the ceramic burner can cause gas to leak around the ceramic tile which can change the flame appearance and make the appliance unsafe.\n\nPilot-burner assemblies are determined by the type of ignition/safety control system used. The two most common types are continuous pilot and intermittent pilot. In addition to igniting the main burner, a continuous or standing pilot also energizes the millivolt control system. An intermittent pilot is automatically ignited when the fireplace is called on to operate and extinguished when the main burner operating cycle is complete. Although a fireplace with continuous pilot ignition can increase energy costs, it has the advantage of operating as an auxiliary heat source that is not dependent on electricity. Modern fireplace electronic burner controls can operate on low DC voltage and can use common dry cell batteries as their backup or main power source, giving intermittent pilot models the same auxiliary heat benefit. Most provinces have adopted energy efficiency standards which ban the sale of continuous pilot fireplaces.\n\nAll gas fireplaces fall into one of two categories: decorative gas fireplaces or heating gas fireplaces. There are three common configurations: gas fireplace inserts, zero-clearance gas fireplaces, and free-standing gas fireplaces. Any of these three types may be available as decorative or heating appliances depending on their efficiency. The glass fronts can be manufactured from tempered or ceramic glass. Ceramic glass is slightly better at transmitting infrared heat and can withstand the higher temperatures that accompany sealed units. A fourth type of fireplace conversion occurs with a gas log set which is strictly classified as decorative.\n\nThe two categories are differentiated by their efficiency. Decorative gas fireplaces do not have a minimum efficiency requirement, while heating gas fireplaces must have a minimum FE of 50% as per CSA P.4.1. For new installations effective January 1, 2010, both categories must be capable of automatic extinguishment of the pilot flame when the main gas burner flame is established and extinguished, prevention of the pilot flame burning continuously for more than seven days if manually switchable to continuous pilot operation, and prevention of any ignition source for the main gas burner flame from operating continuously for more than seven days. New installations must also have a direct-vent configuration unless marked for replacement use only.\n\nGas log sets provide the effects of an open fire without wood, smoke, or ashes. A gas flame provided by a bar-type burner is placed under an arrangement of ceramic logs. Gas logs provide no real heat and can cause venting system problems if the wood fireplace chimney is not relined to accommodate lower-temperature flue gas. The gas log set must be installed only in a vented wood-burning fireplace constructed of non-combustible materials with a working flue. The fireplace damper must be locked fully open when gas logs are installed. A damper stop clam with set screw is provided to prevent the damper blade from closing. If a damper stop cannot be installed, substitute a permanent damper stop that keeps the damper open a minimum of 1.5 in (37 mm). Poor flue draft is normally indicated by fumes smelling like smouldering lamp oil. Gas logs should be operated with glass doors fully opened and screens opened enough to provide sufficient combustion air. The gas log set should be visually inspected and cleaned annually.\n\nFireplace inserts are used to convert existing wood-burning masonry or factory-built fireplaces to gas. Once converted, the fireplace can no longer be used to burn solid fuels. The gas burner and simulated logs are contained in a special metal housing (engine) that fits into the existing fireplace cavity. Some inserts are designed with part of the heat exchange surface extending into the heating space providing radiant heat. Do not insulate around the fireplace insert as this can result in overheating and possible malfunction of any circulating fan. If the insert is natural-draft type, it draws air from the front and outer perimeters providing combustion air, dilution air for venting, and air heated over the heat exchanger. Since most new homes are tightly sealed, direct-vent units are preferred as they have a dedicated combustion air supply duct from outside.\n\nZero-clearance gas fireplaces are used in installations where there is no existing fireplace. These units are usually installed during construction of new homes or during renovation. They have flexibility in location and can be built into a wall, corner, peninsula, or island. Installation involves building the space and framing for the unit. Approved venting materials must be used and manufacturer instructions must be followed for proper clearances from combustibles. The glass used is special high-temperature ceramic glass. If damaged, it should be replaced with a complete glass and frame assembly purchased from an authorized dealer. Substituting with lower-grade glass can cause injury or property damage. The glass should be cleaned with a fireplace glass cleaner to avoid damaging the surface.\n\nControl systems include continuous pilot systems and electronic ignition systems. Continuous pilot systems are not dependent on electricity as the control circuit is powered by a thermopile. The continuous pilot also energizes the thermocouple and flame safety circuit. Intermittent pilot circuits require a power source to operate. They ignite automatically when a fireplace is called on to operate and extinguish when the main burner operating cycle is complete. The flame safety circuit can be a conventional thermocouple connected directly to a gas valve or an electronic flame rod system communicating with a control module. A simple main burner control circuit includes the source of power, a gas valve, and a manual on-off switch or thermostat.\n\nSome models are supplied with an on-off switch or integral thermostat. Other models are designed to be connected to an external thermostat. Modern fireplaces come with remote-control thermostat options. A remote-control thermostat has two components: a transmitter (handset) and a receiver. The hand-held control enables temperature control and on-off operation. Both units have a battery power supply that needs to be replaced every six months. The receiver is attached to the fireplace and synched to the transmitter enabling communication between the components. Electronic ignition systems operate on 24 V ac supplied from a step-down transformer and rely upon a 120 V ac power supply to operate.\n\nSome units are equipped with a vent safety shutdown switch that is factory installed, wired, and tested. Some gas fireplaces have an optional temperature-sensitive switch that turns the blower on and off thermostatically. The blower comes on automatically when the fireplace reaches its optimum operating temperature and turns off automatically when the unit shuts down and temperature decreases.\n\nMany fireplace manufacturers offer blowers installed at factory or as aftermarket options. The blower is thermally activated and starts automatically approximately 10 min after lighting the fireplace and runs for approximately 30 to 45 min after the fireplace has been turned off. Using the fan increases the heat distribution output. The fireplace installation requires a 120 V power source to accommodate the blower. Maintenance includes cleaning the blower assembly and replacing the motor and bearings as necessary.\n\nSome models of zero-clearance fireplaces have knockouts on the exterior for connection of air ducts to disperse warm air to remote locations. These duct systems must be specifically approved for the particular gas fireplace. The air duct kit has its own fan assembly, and the internal fireplace blower cannot be operated when the air duct kit is in use.\n\nModern fireplace electronic burner controls can operate on low DC voltage allowing them to use common dry cell batteries as a backup or main power source. All components in the control circuit come from the same manufacturer and are designed to work with each other on 6 V dc. Modern controls can include options to modulate flame height and heat output as part of the temperature control system. The receiver/control module has a compartment to install 4 AA batteries or a separate battery holder. Fireplace control manufacturers are also creating apps to enable owners to use their personal devices to control their gas fireplace.\n\nAssembly procedures include installing the circulating blower kit if supplied separately and ensuring there is a 120 V ac power supply outlet. Carefully follow placement instructions for the log or ceramic stone as not doing so can lead to blocked burner ports causing incorrect flame pattern, carbon deposits, and delayed ignition. Check that the relief door fibreglass seals are intact, inspect the glass door gasket and install the glass door as per instructions, and install the wire mesh safety barrier designed to reduce the risk of burns from hot viewing glass.\n\nBefore leaving the unit, ensure the appliance is firing correctly and fully explain to the owner the unit's startup, shutdown, and operation procedures. When operating the fireplace for the first time, some vapours may be released when curing compounds are burnt. It is possible for these vapours to set off a smoke-detection alarm. Open a window to vent the room. After a few hours, the vapours will disappear. Do not place clothing or flammable materials on or near the appliance. Do not place furniture or any other combustible household objects within 36 in of the front of the fireplace. Free-standing fireplaces can be a greater burn hazard and young children should be carefully supervised. Inform the owner of the location of the external vent cap and tell them to ensure no debris, plants, trees, or shrubs interfere with the airflow.\n\nMaintenance includes recommending that the homeowner hire a qualified service technician to perform appliance check-ups at the beginning of each heating season. Inspect and operate the pressure relief mechanism to ensure it is free from obstruction and the seals are intact. Use a recommended fireplace glass cleaner to clean both sides of the glass after the first 10 h of operation and thereafter clean as required. Failure to keep the glass clean may result in permanent discoloration or blemishes. Inspect the operation of the flame safety system pilot or flame rectification device. Ensure that lighting of the main burner occurs quickly and smoothly. Visual inspection should match the guidelines outlined in the appliance instruction manual. Inspect primary air openings for blockages. Inspect the condition of the vent and vent terminal for sooting or obstruction and correct if present. Check for evidence of excessive condensation such as water droplets forming in the inner liner and dripping out of the joints. Vacuum and clean debris out of the firebox. Test and measure the flame failure response time of the flame safety system. Check all accessible gas-carrying tubes, connections, pipes, and other components for leaks. Replace the batteries in the handset and receiver.",

The exhaust vent and \ncombustion air inlet are often \ncombined in one unit.\nVented\nVented appliances take the combustion air from the room and exhaust the \nproducts of combustion to the outdoors.\nVenting Requirements\nFollow Manufacturer's Instructions\nInstallation instructions provide specific information on venting \nmaterials and installation parameters\nWall Thickness\nMaximum and minimum wall thickness allowed for direct-vent \nappliances\nVent Material\nB, BW, single wall within heated space; special venting for outdoor use\nStarter Vent Kit\nManufacturers often provide a starter vent kit with the appliance \nincluding vent, spacers, collars, terminals, etc.\nMasonry Chimney Requirements\nDo\n•\nInspect the masonry chimney before installing the unit\n•\nMake sure that the chimney's clay flue liner is not \ncracked, soft, or spalled\n•\nVerify that mortar joints between liner sections are in \nplace and tight\n•\nClean creosote from the top, sides, and back of a \nmasonry firebox before installing a non-vented \ndecorative appliance\n•\nCheck whether your local codes require the fireplace \ndamper to be clamped open or removed\nDo Not\n•\nShare a gas-fired appliance flue with a wood-burning \nappliance\nProper vent termination for any gas-fired appliance is \ncritical to the overall safe and efficient functioning of the \nventing system. The vent terminal clearance criteria for \nspace heaters follows standard practice as outlined in Unit \n22 Venting Practices.\nGeneral Installation Considerations\n1\nLocation\nDue to high temperatures, the appliance should be located out of traffic and away from \nfurniture and draperies.\n2\nClear Area\nThe appliance area must remain clear and free from combustible materials, gasoline, \nand other flammable vapours and liquids.\n3\nGlass Integrity\nIf the appliance has glass, it should not be operated with the glass removed, cracked, or \nbroken. Replacement of the glass should be done by a licensed or qualified service \nperson.\n4\nFloor Protection\nIf installing the heating appliance on carpet, vinyl tile, or any combustible material, it \nmust be first installed on a metal or wood panel extending the full width and depth of the \nappliance.\nInstallation in Special Locations\nGarage Installation\nIf installed in a residential garage, \nthe heater must be protected from \ndamage and must be located no \nless than 18 inches (396 mm) above \nthe floor.\nSleeping Room Installation\nA room heater may be installed in a \nsleeping room provided that it is of \nthe automatic temperature control \ntype, is equipped with a pressure \nregulator, has a 100% safety shut-\noff, and is vented.\nBathroom Installation\nSpace heaters installed in a \nbathroom must be of the direct-\nvent type.\nCombustion Air Requirements\nAir Supply\nBecause many space heaters receive their combustion air \nfrom the room, it is very important that the air supply inlets \nat the front or side of the appliance remain free from \nobstruction.\nRoom heaters should not be used in a room that has limited \nair exchange with adjacent spaces, since combustion air is \nrequired for the space.\nCustomer Instructions\nTypically, the manufacturer's instructions provide cautions \nconcerning any potential dangers:\n•\nChildren and adults should be alerted to the hazards of \nhigh surface temperature and stay away to avoid burns \nor clothing ignition\n•\nYoung children need careful supervision when in the \nsame room as the heating unit\n•\nClothing and other flammable material should not be \nplaced on or near the heating unit\nThermostat Installation\nPosition on Inside Wall\nInstall external thermostat on an inside wall in the same room as the \nheater\nProper Height\nPosition about 5 ft (150 cm) above the floor\nEasy Access\nEnsure position provides ready access to wiring, temperature \nadjustment, and servicing\nAvoid Problem Areas\nDo not locate in unusually warm/cold areas, direct sunlight, near \nheat sources, or areas with poor air circulation\nMillivolt Thermostats\nSpecial Requirements\nThe requirements for locating millivolt thermostats are \nsomewhat different because the power supply is self-\ngenerated, and the system can therefore power only a \nlimited number of components.\nSince the thermostat wire in the system adds resistance — \nresulting in a voltage drop - the size of the wire is \nproportional to the distance between the thermostat and \nthe appliance. For example, a larger gauge of wire has less \nresistance, therefore the thermostat can be located further \nfrom the appliance.\nSize of copper wire (solid \nor stranded)\nDistance between \nthermostat and heater\n14 GA\n100 ft (30 m)\n16 GA\n64 ft (19.2 m)\n18 GA\n40 ft (12 m)\n20 GA\n25 ft (7.5 m)\n22 GA\n16 ft (4.8 m)\nProgrammable Thermostats\nCompatibility with \nMillivolt Systems\nSome electronic \nprogrammable thermostats \nare compatible with millivolt \nsystems since many now \nutilize a battery backup power \nsupply.\nNo Transformer \nRequired\nMany modern programmable \nthermostats do not require a \n24-volt transformer to power \nthe thermostat.\nVerification Required\nAlways confirm the thermostat compatibility prior to installation.\nGeneral Maintenance \nConsiderations\nRegular Cleaning\nSpace heaters require regular cleaning, both i",

If rigid metal duct cannot be \nused, then UL-listed flexible metal (semi-rigid) ducting can be used (Kit \nWX08X10077). In special installations, it may be necessary to connect the dryer \nto the house vent using a flexible metal (foil-type) duct. A UL-listed flexible \nmetal (foil-type) duct may be used ONLY in installations where rigid metal or \nflexible metal (semi-rigid)  ducting cannot be used AND where a 4\" diameter \ncan be maintained throughout the entire length of the transition duct. Please \nsee installation instruction packed with your dryer for complete instructions \nwhen using flexible metal (foil type) ducting.\nEXHAUST LENGTH CALCULATION:\n1. \u0007Determine the number of 90° turns needed for your installation. If you \nexhaust to the side or bottom of dryer, add one turn.\n2. \u0007The maximum length of 4\" rigid (aluminum or galvanized) duct which can be \ntolerated is shown  in the table.\nFor every extra 90° elbow, reduce the allowable vent system length by 10 ft. Two \n45° elbows will be treated like one 90° elbow. For the side exhaust installations, \nadd one 90° elbow to the chart. The total vent system length includes all the \nstraight portions and elbows of the system (transition duct included).\nDryers must be exhausted to the outside.\nCAUTION: For personal safety do not terminate exhaust into a chimney, under \nany enclosed house floor (crawl space), or into an attic, since the accumulated \nlint could create a fire hazard or moisture could cause damage. Never terminate \nthe exhaust into a common duct or plenum with a kitchen exhaust, since the \ncombination of lint and grease could create a fire hazard.\nExhaust ducts should be terminated in a dampered wall cap to prevent back \ndrafts, bird nesting, etc. The wall cap must also be located at least 12\" above the \nground or any other obstruction with the opening pointed down.\nGUD24 DRYER EXHAUST LENGTH*\n4\" DIA.\n4\"\n4\" DIA.\n4\" DIA.\n2-1/2\"\nRECOMMENDED MAXIMUM LENGTH\nExhaust Hood Types\nRecommended\nNo. of 90º\nElbows\nRigid\nMetal\nRigid\nMetal\n43 Feet\n33 Feet\n24 Feet\n0\n1\n2\n36 Feet\n26 Feet\n16 Feet\nUse only for short\nrun installations\nGUD24ESSM/24GSSM \nGE® Unitized Spacemaker® 2.3 DOE Cu.
