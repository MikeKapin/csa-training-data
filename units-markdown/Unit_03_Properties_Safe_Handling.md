Butane
Heaviest common fuel gas
With a specific gravity of 0.55, natural gas is lighter than air and will rise to the ceiling of a room. Both propane and butane are heavier than
air, so if a leak develops in a gas line or appliance, LP-gas is likely to settle in low areas. This is an important consideration when trying to find
the source of a leak or working where a leak has occurred.

Specific Gravity of LP-Gases as Liquids
Comparison to Water
The specific gravity of LP-gas is normally compared to
water, which has a specific gravity of 1.0.
Practical Applications
Understanding liquid specific gravity can be useful in the
following cases:
•During delivery of propane to a plant, the liquid specific
gravity marked on a bill of lading helps you check the
type and amount of LP-gas delivered.
•During filling, you may use the liquid specific gravity to
determine the proper filling limit to prevent overfilling of
the tank.

Expansion Factors
Temperature Increase
When the temperature of a liquid is increased, the liquid expands with
a resulting increase in its volume.
Boyle's Law
This is stated in Boyle's Law, which concerns the relationship between
pressure and volume in gases, i.e., p₁V₁ = p₂V₂.
Container Filling
Allowing an expansion space between the level of liquid and the top of
the container requires filling LP-gas containers to a maximum of 80%.
Vapor Formation
Vapour forms above the liquid to fill the space left for expansion. The
molecular movement of LP-gas vapours results in vapour pressure.

Liquid to Gas Expansion Ratios

Natural Gas
Expansion ratio of liquid to gas at atmospheric pressure

Propane
Expansion ratio of liquid to gas at atmospheric pressure
When a fuel changes from liquid to gas, a tremendous expansion takes place.
This information can be useful when calculating the volume of vapour available
from a volume of liquid fuel.

Boiling Points
Natural Gas
Natural gas has a boiling temperature of -260°F (-162.2°C) at atmospheric pressure.
A gas technician/fitter almost always handles natural gas in the gaseous state. (The utility company may, however, store liquefied
natural gas for use during high demand periods.)
Propane
Propane has a boiling temperature of -44°F (-42.2°C) at atmospheric pressure.
Because LP-gas is subject to temperature changes, the temperature of the liquid determines the pressure in the container.

Temperature and Pressure Relationships
Temperature Increase
As the LP-gas temperature
increases, so does the pressure
increase in the storage tank
Pressure Increase
As the pressure is increased, the
boiling temperature (saturation
point) becomes progressively higher
Vapor Withdrawal
When vapour exhausts from the
cylinder, the pressure drop causes
the boiling temperature to drop
Equilibrium
The liquid starts to vapourize to
maintain the temperature-pressure
relationship

Important Pressure-
Temperature Facts
Pressure and Fill Level
The pressure always varies
with the temperature, not
with the liquid content of the
cylinder. For example, the
pressure in a cylinder that is
30% full is the same as the
pressure when it is 60% full.
Butane Limitations
Note that butane has similar
characteristics to propane.
The biggest factor in the
nonuse of butane in Canada
is that its boiling temperature
is 32°F (0°C). At that same
temperature, butane has a
vapour pressure of zero.
Pressure-Temperature Chart
Technicians use temperature-pressure relationship charts to predict
the pressure in propane tanks at various temperatures.

Propane Temperature-Pressure Relationship
Temperature (°F)Pressure (psig)
This chart shows how propane pressure increases with temperature. Liquefication of natural gas is only possible at very low temperatures and/or very high pressures so the gas technician/fitter always
finds it in a gaseous state. However, in enclosed cylinders, propane is commonly in its liquid state.

Calorific Value (Heat Content)
Definition
The calorific value (heat content) of a fuel usually refers to the energy
released during combustion of a given volume of fuel.
Units of Measurement
Generally, the units of measurement used are British Thermal Units per cubic
foot (Btu/ft³) or mega joules per cubic meter (MJ/m³).
A Btu is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 lb of water
1°F.
Variability
The calorific value of natural gas varies from gas well because of the different
components of natural gas.
Importance
You need to understand the calorific value of gases when calculating input
rates to appliances.

Combustion Data
In this section, you identify combustion data related to the physical properties of natural gas and propane.
Limits of Flammability
Limits of flammability are the upper and lower ranges of
gas in the air-gas mixture that supports combustion. You
must know these limits in order to supply the correct
amount of air to gas burners or troubleshoot burner
problems. Also, knowing the limits of flammability is key
to responding to a gas leakage call.
The lower flammable limit is the weakest air-gas mixture
that burns. The upper limit is the strongest air-gas mix
that produces and sustains combustion. Too low an
amount of fuel makes the mixture "lean." Too high an
amount of fuel renders the mix too "rich."
Ignition Temperature
Ignition temperature is the temperature at which an air-
gas mixture initiates and supports combustion. It varies
according to the fuel gas used.

More Combustion Data
Flame Temperature
You can only reach maximum flame temperature at perfect
combustion, which is the theoretical point at which combustion may
occur. In practice, the gas technician/fitter provides excess air to
provide enough oxygen to ensure the complete combustion of the
fuel. Each fuel gas has its own maximum flame temperature.
Flame Speed
Flame speed is the speed at which the flame front moves towards
the air-gas mixture issuing from the burner port. Flame speed
depends on the quantity of air in the air-gas mixture and the type of
gas you are using.

Limits of Flammability
Lower Limit %Upper Limit %
The limits of flammability represent the range of gas-to-air ratios that will support combustion. Below the lower limit, the mixture is too lean to burn. Above the upper limit, the mixture is too rich.
Understanding these limits is crucial for safe operation and troubleshooting of gas appliances.

Propane
495°C ignition temperature
The ignition temperature is the minimum temperature required for the gas to ignite when mixed with the proper amount of air.
Note that propane has a significantly lower ignition temperature than natural gas, making it more easily ignitable in certain
conditions.

Flame Temperature and Speed
Maximum Flame Temperature
Both natural gas and propane have a maximum flame temperature of 3,600°F (1,980°C) under perfect combustion
conditions.
In practice, the gas technician/fitter provides excess air to ensure complete combustion of the fuel, which slightly
reduces the actual flame temperature.
Flame Speed
Natural gas has a flame speed of approximately 12 in/s (305 mm/s).
Propane has a slightly slower flame speed of approximately 11 in/s (280 mm/s).
These measurements are based on a Bunsen-type burner test method and can vary based on the air-gas mixture ratio.

Importance of Combustion Data
Appliance Adjustment
Understanding combustion data allows technicians to properly adjust gas
appliances for optimal performance and safety.
Troubleshooting
Knowledge of flame characteristics helps identify problems with gas appliances
and systems.
Safety Procedures
Awareness of flammability limits and ignition temperatures is crucial when
responding to gas leaks.
System Design
Combustion data informs the proper design of gas systems and selection of
components.

Methane Molecule Structure
Tetrahedral Structure
The methane molecule (CH₄) has a tetrahedral structure with the carbon atom at the center and four hydrogen atoms at the corners.
Bond Angles
The bond angles between hydrogen atoms in methane are approximately 109.5 degrees, creating a stable, symmetrical structure.
Chemical Stability
This structure makes methane the most stable of the hydrocarbon molecules, allowing it to exist unchanged at temperatures up to 1022°F (550°C).

Propane Molecule Structure
Linear Carbon Chain
Propane (C₃H₈) consists of three carbon atoms in a chain with eight hydrogen atoms attached.
Molecular Structure
The carbon atoms form a zigzag pattern rather than a straight line, with hydrogen atoms arranged around them.
Chemical Bonds
Propane features single covalent bonds between all atoms, making it relatively stable but more reactive than methane.

Odorization of Fuel Gases
Mercaptan Addition
Since natural gas and propane are naturally odorless,
mercaptan is added as a safety measure to make leaks
detectable by smell.
Detection Standard
The odorant concentration must be sufficient to be readily
detectable when the fuel gas concentration equals 1% of
room volume.
Chemical Formula
The chemical formula for ethyl mercaptan typically used in
natural gas is C₂H₅S.
Concentration
To detect a gas leak below its lower flammable limit, every
one million cubic feet of gas should have approximately one
pound of mercaptan.

Natural Gas Production and Processing
Extraction
Natural gas is extracted from
underground reservoirs, often
alongside petroleum deposits or
from dedicated gas fields.
Processing
Raw natural gas undergoes
processing to remove
impurities, water, and heavier
hydrocarbons like propane and
butane.
Odorization
Mercaptan is added to give the
gas its characteristic smell for
safety purposes.
Distribution
The processed gas is
transported through pipelines
to distribution centers and
ultimately to end users.

Propane Production and Processing
Extraction
Propane is extracted as a
component of natural gas
processing or as a byproduct of
petroleum refining.
Separation
It is separated from other
hydrocarbons through a
process called fractionation,
which uses different boiling
points to isolate specific
compounds.
Liquefaction
The propane is compressed and
cooled to convert it to a liquid
state for easier storage and
transport.
Distribution
Liquefied propane is
transported in pressurized tanks
to distribution centers and then
to end users in smaller cylinders
or tanks.

Propane Storage and Handling
Safety Procedures
Follow all safety protocols for handling pressurized gas
Temperature Monitoring
Monitor tank temperature to prevent excessive pressure
Proper Fill Levels
Never fill tanks beyond 80% capacity
Regular Inspection
Check tanks and connections for leaks and damage
Proper storage and handling of propane is essential for safety. Propane is stored as a liquid under pressure, and tanks must never be filled
beyond 80% capacity to allow for thermal expansion. Regular inspection of tanks, valves, and connections is necessary to prevent leaks.

Natural Gas Safety Considerations
Detect odors
Be alert to the smell of mercaptan
Ensure ventilation
Provide adequate air for combustion
Proper installation
Follow all codes and standards
Regular inspection
Check equipment and connections
Natural gas is lighter than air, so leaks will rise and collect near ceilings. This property affects how technicians should approach leak detection and
ventilation strategies. Despite being non-toxic, natural gas can cause asphyxiation by displacing oxygen in enclosed spaces.

Propane Safety Considerations
Detect odors
Be alert to the smell of mercaptan
Check low areas
Propane is heavier than air
Monitor temperature
Prevent excessive pressure
Proper installation
Follow all codes and standards
Propane is heavier than air, so leaks will sink and collect in low areas like basements, crawl spaces, and ditches. This property significantly affects
how technicians should approach leak detection and ventilation strategies. Special attention must be paid to low-lying areas when checking for
propane leaks.

Boyle's Law and Gas Behavior
Boyle's Law Formula
p₁V₁ = p₂V₂
This equation states that the absolute pressure that a given
mass of an ideal gas exerts is inversely proportional to the
volume it occupies if the temperature and amount of gas
remain unchanged within a closed system.
Practical Applications
•Understanding pressure changes in gas lines
•Calculating volume changes in storage tanks
•Designing pressure regulators
When the volume of a gas decreases, its pressure increases
proportionally, assuming temperature remains constant.
This principle is fundamental to understanding how gases
behave in closed systems like propane tanks and gas lines.

Vapor Pressure in LP-Gas Containers
Temperature Effect
Vapor pressure is directly related to
the temperature of the liquid in an
enclosed container
Below Boiling Point
If the temperature of a fuel gas is
lower than its boiling point, it will not
vaporize, and no vapor pressure will
develop
Increasing Temperature
As the LP-gas temperature
increases, so does the pressure
increase in the storage tank
3
Pressure Equilibrium
The pressure always varies with the
temperature, not with the liquid
content of the cylinder

Calculating Gas Input Rates
Importance of Calorific Value
Understanding the calorific value (heat content) of gases is essential when calculating input rates to appliances.
Input Rate Formula
Input Rate (Btu/h) = Volume Flow Rate (ft³/h) × Calorific Value (Btu/ft³)
Metric Calculation
Input Rate (kW) = Volume Flow Rate (m³/h) × Calorific Value (kW/m³)
Example Calculation
For a natural gas appliance with a flow rate of 2 m³/h:
Input Rate = 2 m³/h × 10.35 kW/m³ = 20.7 kW
For Propane
The same calculation using propane's higher calorific value would yield a much higher input rate, which is why orifice sizes must
be adjusted when converting appliances between fuel types.

Flame Characteristics
Perfect Combustion
A properly adjusted gas flame has a
clear blue color with well-defined inner
and outer cones. This indicates
complete combustion with the right air-
gas mixture.
Incomplete Combustion
Yellow flames indicate incomplete
combustion, often due to insufficient
primary air. This can lead to carbon
monoxide production and should be
corrected immediately.
Flame Lifting
When flames lift away from the burner
ports, it indicates too much primary air
or excessive gas pressure. This
condition can lead to flame extinction
and gas leakage.

Flame Speed and Burner Design
Flame Speed Definition
Flame speed is the speed at which the flame front moves
towards the air-gas mixture issuing from the burner port.
Factors Affecting Flame Speed
•Type of gas (natural gas vs. propane)
•Air-gas mixture ratio
•Temperature of the mixture
•Burner port design
Importance in Burner Design
Burners must be designed so that the gas flow velocity from
the ports is slightly higher than the flame speed to prevent
flashback (flame traveling back into the burner).

Gas Leak Detection
Smell Test
The first indication of a gas leak is often the smell of mercaptan,
the odorant added to natural gas and propane.
Soap Solution Test
Apply a soap solution to suspected leak areas. Bubbles will form
where gas is escaping.
Electronic Detection
Use electronic gas detectors calibrated for the specific gas being
tested.
Systematic Inspection
Check all joints, connections, and potential leak points in a
methodical manner.

Responding to Gas Leaks
Evacuate the Area
If a significant leak is detected,
ensure everyone leaves the
building immediately.
Call for Help
Contact emergency services and
the gas utility from a safe
location.
Avoid Ignition Sources
Do not operate electrical
switches, use phones, or create
any sparks in the affected area.
Ventilate if Safe
If it's safe to do so, open doors and windows to allow
gas to dissipate.
Shut Off Gas
If possible and safe, turn off the main gas supply valve.

Sizing Gas Piping Systems
Factors to Consider
•Type of gas (natural gas or propane)
•Specific gravity of the gas
•Length of pipe run
•Number of fittings
•Total gas load (BTU/hr)
•Allowable pressure drop
Importance of Proper Sizing
Properly sized gas piping ensures that all appliances receive adequate gas supply at the correct pressure, even when all appliances are
operating simultaneously.
Undersized piping can lead to insufficient gas flow, poor appliance performance, and potentially dangerous operating conditions.

Orifice Sizing
Gas Type
Different gases require different orifice sizes due to variations in
specific gravity and calorific value
Calculate Input
Determine the required BTU input for the appliance
Pressure Consideration
Account for the gas pressure at the orifice
Select Orifice
Choose the correct orifice size based on calculations
Orifice sizing is critical when converting appliances between natural gas and
propane. Due to propane's higher calorific value, propane orifices are typically
smaller than those for natural gas to deliver the same heat output.

Propane Tank Filling Safety
80% Fill Rule
Propane tanks should never be filled beyond 80% of their capacity to
allow for thermal expansion of the liquid.
Weight Method
One method to ensure proper filling is to weigh the tank and stop filling
when the correct weight is reached.
Fixed Liquid Level Gauge
Many tanks have a fixed liquid level gauge (bleeder valve) that indicates
when the 80% level is reached.
Float Gauge
Some tanks use a float gauge that directly indicates the percentage of
fill in the tank.

Propane Cylinder Storage Requirements
Outdoor Storage
•Store cylinders outdoors in a well-
ventilated area
•Keep away from building openings, air
intakes, and ignition sources
•Maintain minimum clearance
distances from buildings
•Protect from vehicle traffic with
barriers if necessary
Position
•Store cylinders upright with relief
valve in direct communication with
the vapor space
•Secure cylinders to prevent tipping
•Keep valve protection caps in place
when not in use
Environmental Factors
•Protect from direct sunlight and
excessive heat
•Keep away from corrosive
environments
•Ensure area is free from combustible
materials

Natural Gas Distribution System
Transmission Pipelines
High-pressure pipelines transport natural gas from production facilities to distribution centers, typically operating at
pressures between 200 and 1,500 psig.
City Gate Stations
These facilities reduce the pressure from transmission levels to distribution levels and add odorant to the gas.
Distribution Mains
Medium-pressure pipelines (typically 1-60 psig) that carry gas throughout service areas.
Service Lines
Low-pressure lines (typically 0.25-2 psig) that connect distribution mains to individual customers.
Meter and Regulator
Equipment at the customer location that measures gas usage and reduces pressure to appliance level (typically 0.25
psig or 7 inches water column).

Propane Distribution System
Production Facilities
Propane is produced at natural gas processing plants and petroleum refineries.
Storage Terminals
Large pressurized tanks store propane in liquid form at distribution hubs.
Transport
Propane is transported via pipeline, rail, truck, or ship to bulk plants.
Bulk Plants
Regional facilities that store propane and fill delivery trucks.
Customer Delivery
Propane is delivered to customer locations and stored in on-site tanks or cylinders.

Requirements of Combustion
Combustion is a chemical process in which the rapid oxidation of fuel results in the production of energy (heat). To start and
sustain combustion, you must have three ingredients mixed together in the correct proportions:
Fuel
Usually natural gas or liquid petroleum gases
Oxygen
Obtained from the air surrounding a burner
Heat
Enough to bring the fuel to ignition point
Uninhibited Chemical Chain Reaction
Allows the combustion process to continue

The Combustion Triangle
If any one of these elements is absent, combustion will not take place nor will it support itself after an element is removed. This
three-way relationship is commonly referred to as the combustion triangle.
Figure 2-1 The combustion triangle and advanced
combustion triangle
You can think of the combustion process as a living entity--
it requires air to breathe, fuel as nourishment, and heat as an
environment. Without one of the three, combustion ceases
to exist.
The combustion triangle introduces the three basic
elements required for combustion: air (O2 and N2), fuel
(hydrocarbon), and ignition (heat). The advanced
combustion triangle introduces additional elements that aid
the technician/fitter in understanding and controlling
combustion: time, temperature, turbulence, oxygen, carbon
dioxide, and excess air.

Nitrogen in Combustion
Nitrogen introduced into the combustion system is an inert gas, in that it doesn't chemically react in the combustion process. Nitrogen
does absorb heat, increase flue gas volume and, at high flame temperatures, has a thermal fixation for oxygen, binding to oxygen to
form nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide commonly referred to as NOx gasses. NOx gases are toxic, and concentrations of 15 ppm are
immediately dangerous to life and health.
Fuel
Natural gas, propane, and butane are
hydrocarbon fuels burned in a gaseous
state.
Heat/ignition
Igniting the air gas mixture requires
the supply of enough heat by a
previously lit small flame such as a
pilot, an ignition spark, or a hot surface
igniter. Once you have provided this
initial heat, the heat released from the
combustion process sustains itself.
Oxygen
For the combustion process to
consume oxygen, it must be readily
available. Generally, the required
oxygen supply comes from the air.
Because air contains only 20% oxygen
and 80% nitrogen, we must supply a
much larger volume of air than the
combustion process would require if
the supply were pure oxygen.

Advanced Combustion Elements
Temperature
Temperature of combustion is
important for efficiency and
combustion control. The better the air
fuel mixture, the more time the flame
is given to burn, and the hotter the
flame temperature. The increased
flame temperature increases the
radiant heat transfer to the heat
exchanger.
Time
Time is an important variable for
combustion control. Time relates to
the air fuel mixture and how long the
flame is given to burn. Time relates to
temperature.
Turbulence
Turbulence relates to the air fuel
mixture, flame temperature, and heat
transfer. Time, temperature, and
turbulence all relate to oxygen, carbon
dioxide, and excess air, in that better
mixing of air and fuel reduces the
amount of excess air required for
complete combustion. The decrease in
excess air increases flame
temperature and increases the
percentage of carbon dioxide in the
products of combustion. The decrease
in excess air reduces the volume of
oxygen remaining after combustion.

Ignition Temperatures

PropaneC3H8920°F (495°C)
Ignition temperatures vary according to the type of gas used, as shown in
the table above. Each fuel has a specific temperature at which it will
ignite and sustain combustion.

The Chemistry of Combustion
The chemistry of combustion is the reaction which takes place between fuel gas and oxygen when heated to ignition temperature. Mixing
the elements of hydrocarbons with enough oxygen to support combustion leads to the formation of carbon dioxide and water vapor, and
the release of heat as the products of combustion.
Natural Gas (Methane) Reaction
The chemical formula expressing the combustion reaction for
natural gas and oxygen is:
CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O + heat
Propane Reaction
The chemical formula describing the combustion for propane and
oxygen is:
C3H8 + 5O2 → 3CO2 + 4H2O + heat

Types of Combustion
This section describes the following three types of combustion, each determined by the initial air supply:
Perfect or Stoichiometric Combustion
Theoretical ideal ratio
Complete Combustion
All fuel burned with excess air
Incomplete Combustion
Insufficient oxygen for full burning

Perfect or Stoichiometric Combustion
Perfect or stoichiometric combustion refers to the theoretical (or mathematically exact) volume of air that you must mix with
fuel gas to achieve perfect combustion. This gas-air mixture is often called the ideal combustion ratio.
The formula for perfect combustion is used for theoretical calculations only. This is because most burners cannot practically
mix exact gas and air volumes together to produce satisfactory combustion. In practice, some of the hydrogen and carbon
produced will combine with oxygen, so incomplete combustion will occur.
Because air is 20% oxygen (O2) and 80% nitrogen (N2), nitrogen is included in the perfect combustion formula. In the following
formula for perfect combustion, there are 8 parts of nitrogen to two parts of oxygen. Note that nitrogen is inert and doesn't
chemically react in the combustion process, although at high flame temperatures it has a thermal fixation for oxygen.

Perfect Combustion Formula
Natural Gas (Methane)
CH4 + 2O2 + 8N2 → CO2 + 2H2O + 8N2 + heat
Propane
C3H8 + 5O2 + 20N2 → 3CO2 + 4H2O + 20N2 + heat
These formulas represent the ideal theoretical combustion
process where exactly the right amount of oxygen is present
to completely burn the fuel.

Complete Combustion
Since perfect combustion is only possible in theory, you must adjust the equipment to ensure complete burning of all fuel and prevent the production of harmful
products from incomplete combustion. This process is complete combustion.
Normally, to achieve combustion, technicians/fitters supply more air to the combustion process than perfect combustion requires to ensure that all atoms of
carbon and hydrogen united with enough atoms of oxygen to produce complete combustion.
Natural Gas Formula
CH4 + 2O2 + 8N2 + excess air → CO2 + 2H2O + 8N2 + excess air + heat
Propane Formula
C3H8 + 5O2 + 20N2 + excess air → 3CO2 + 4H2O + 20N2 + excess air + heat

Incomplete Combustion
Where there is not enough oxygen to burn the fuel gas completely, some of the fuel will not unite with its oxygen counterpart and will leave unburned fuel in the flue gas. The unburned fuel will contain
carbon, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and complex chains of alcohols called aldehydes.
The flue gas products of incomplete combustion (particularly carbon monoxide and hydrogen) are often grouped together as combustibles. Carbon monoxide and aldehydes in any quantity are toxic
and life threatening.
Natural Gas Formula
CH4 + 1O2 + 4N2 → CO + H2O + H + 4N2 + heat
Propane Formula
C3H8 + 4O2 + 16N2 → CO + H2O + H + 16N2 + heat
These formulas show how insufficient oxygen leads to incomplete combustion and the formation
of carbon monoxide instead of carbon dioxide.

Products of Incomplete
Combustion
Carbon Monoxide (CO)
Carbon monoxide is one of the most harmful products of incomplete
combustion. It is toxic (i.e., it can cause death if enough is inhaled). Since it has
no odour, taste, or smell, it is hard to detect without proper equipment. In higher
concentrations, it is combustible.
Aldehydes
Aldehydes are a group of transparent, colourless gases with a suffocating smell,
produced by the partial oxidation of fuel gas. Because of this, they are easily
detected. They are toxic and irritating to the eyes, throat, and nose.
Other factors besides insufficient air can cause incomplete combustion. The Causes
of Incomplete Combustion section describes these in more detail.

Measuring Carbon Monoxide
Measured carbon monoxide levels can vary greatly depending on where they are taken. For example, measurements taken upstream of
the draft hood diverter on a water heater will render higher CO levels than downstream of the draft hood diverter due to dilution air
entering the draft hood relief opening. One way to compensate is to express the CO measurement on an air-free basis.
CO Air Free Calculation
You can calculate CO air free using the following formula:
CO air free = 20.9 ÷ (20.9 - O2 measured) × measured CO ppm
Example:
CO air free = 20.9 ÷ (20.9 - 7.0) × 100ppm CO
CO air free = 20.9 ÷ 13.9 × 100ppm
CO air free = 1.50 × 100ppm CO
CO air free ppm = 150
Alternative Calculation Method
To calculate carbon monoxide air free, you can also measure the
carbon dioxide (CO2) level from the same sample and calculate
the CO on a theoretical air-free basis. For natural gas
combustion, the CO2 level at complete combustion is 11.8%, and
for propane, 13.8%.
The formula is:
CO (air-free) = CO (measured) × CO2 (ultimate) ÷ CO2
(measured)

Air Supply Requirements
The efficient and safe operation of gas-fired appliances relies on an adequate supply of air. For present purposes, we divide our air supply into three main
categories:
Combustion Air (Theoretical)
The air required for the satisfactory combustion of a gas
Excess Air
Additional air to ensure complete combustion
Dilution Air
Air that cools hot vent gases and controls draft

Combustion Air Types
Combustion air is the air required for the satisfactory combustion of a gas. Normally, combustion air includes excess air, but here, combustion air will
refer to the theoretical air discussed earlier in perfect combustion.
You can further classify combustion air into two:
Primary Air
Primary air refers to the combustion air that is mixed with fuel gas
before ignition. The amount of primary air is normally considered to be
one-third of the theoretical amount of air used for combustion.
Secondary Air
The secondary air required to complete the combustion of the gas is
mixed with the fuel at the point of combustion. Secondary air is supplied
from around the flames and is generally considered to be two-thirds of
the theoretical air considered for perfect combustion.

Secondary Air Supply
Figure 2-7 Supply to burner of primary and secondary air
around the flame
Secondary Air Function
Secondary air completes the combustion process by
providing additional oxygen at the flame itself. This air is not
pre-mixed with the gas but instead surrounds the flame and
mixes during combustion.
The proper balance of primary and secondary air is crucial
for efficient and complete combustion. Too little secondary
air can result in incomplete combustion and the formation of
carbon monoxide.

Excess Air
Excess air is the air you supply to the combustion zone in excess of the required air for perfect combustion to ensure there is sufficient oxygen for complete combustion
to occur. Because the excess air is over and above what is theoretically needed in the combustion process, it absorbs heat, which it carries off through the venting system.
This, in turn, reduces the appliance's efficiency. So, you must keep excess air to a minimum.
Figure 2-8 shows where combustion and excess air are brought into a furnace.
* Combustion air = primary air + secondary air

Dilution Air
Dilution air is the ambient air that is admitted to a venting system at the
draft control device of the appliance. Use it for two purposes:
Cool the hot vent gases
Reduces the temperature of combustion products in the venting
system
Provide a source of air to the draft control device
Allows the device to control the draft influence on the combustion
chamber
The lack of a draft control device in the equipment means no dilution air
is required.

Calculating Air Supply Volumes
For the purpose of calculating volumes of required air, air supply has the following
categories:
Combustion air supply
The theoretical air needed for perfect combustion
Excess air supply
Additional air to ensure complete combustion
Dilution air supply
Air for cooling and draft control
Total air supply
The sum of all air requirements

Combustion Air Supply Volume
The natural gas industry has always used a 10:1 ratio for the air-gas mixture required to achieve perfect combustion. This, of
course, refers only to natural gas and air. In terms of volume, one cubic foot (1 ft³) of natural gas combines with 10 cubic feet
(10 ft³) of air.
1 ft³ CH4 + 10 ft³ air = perfect combustion
As a gas technician/fitter, you will work with many types of fuel gases, and they all have something in common when it comes
to perfect combustion. For each 1,000 Btu of heat the combustion process produces, you will need 10 ft³ of air for perfect
combustion. See the following formula:
1,000 Btu of input + 10 ft³ air = perfect combustion
You can still apply the ratio of 10:1, but it means that you need 10 ft³ of air for each 1,000 Btu of input. Thus, you could express a
new ratio, applicable to all fuel gases:
Each (1,000 Btu of input) × 10 ft³ = perfect combustion

Combustion Air Calculation Examples
Example 1 - Natural Gas
Calculate the volume of combustion air required for an
appliance with an 80,000 Btu/h input, fired on natural gas.
80,000 Btu/h × 10 ÷ 1,000 = 800 ft³/h combustion air
Example 2 - Propane
Calculate the volume of combustion air required for an
appliance with a 25,000 Btu/h input, fired on propane.
25,000 Btu/h × 10 ÷ 1,000 = 250 ft³/h combustion air
1,000 Btu of input requires 10 ft³ of combustion air supply, whatever the type of fuel gas used.

Excess Air Supply Volume
The excess air that you supply to a burner ensures the combination of all fuel with oxygen to produce complete combustion. A
lack of excess air may cause varying degrees of incomplete combustion, while too much excess air can cool the flame and
cause incomplete combustion. Too much excess air will increase the volume of gases in the heat exchanger and may cause
spillage of flue gases. Too much excess air will carry off heat, reducing the efficiency of the appliance.
Modern fan-assisted burners and power burners can operate efficiently, often with as little as 20-30% excess air. For
atmospheric burners, complete combustion with a volume of excess air equal to 50% of the combustion air volume is usually
acceptable. A relationship between Btu of input and the volume of excess air required can be as follows:
1,000 Btu of input requires 5 ft³ of excess air supply.

Dilution Air Supply Volume
If an appliance comes with a draft control device, a volume of air must enter the venting system in order to cool and control the stack
action. The required volume of dilution air being equal to the total of the combustion and excess air supplied to the burner is usually
acceptable. The relationship between Btu of input and the volume of dilution air required is as follows:
1,000 Btu of input requires 15 ft³ of dilution air supply.
Total Air Supply Volume
Use the term total air to describe the volume of air required to
allow the safe and efficient operation of the appliance. It is a total
of combustion, excess, and dilution air requirements. The
relationship between Btu of input and the volume of total air
required is as follows:
1,000 Btu of input requires 30 ft³ of total air supply.

High Altitude Installations
Certain areas in Canada (e.g., regions in B.C. and Alberta) are located at high altitude. It is important that you understand the effect of reduced atmospheric
pressure on combustion performance.
The barometric pressure at sea level is 14.73 psia. If you visualize a balloon filled with one standard ft³ of natural gas at sea level 14.73 psia, the balloon expands in
volume to equalize against the atmospheric pressure.
For every 2,000 ft rise in elevation, the barometric pressure reduces by approximately 1 psia. For example, as the altitude increases, the pressure exerted on the
sides of the balloon reduces, and the lower the pressure, the more the balloon volume expands. At a 2,000 ft rise, the volume of natural gas would expand to
approximately 1.072 ft³ and become less dense. You can calculate the amount of expansion using Boyle's Law, which states "the volume of dry gas varies inversely
to the absolute pressure, providing the temperature remains constant" or p₁V₁ = p₂V₂.

Effects of High Altitude
This reduction in gas density at high altitudes changes the gas flow into the orifice. Because the gas is less dense, it flows more
easily through a burner orifice, increasing the gas flow to the appliance and putting the input-to-oxygen ratio out of balance.
Air Supply Summary
To determine the necessary volume of air supply, it is important that you identify the input of the appliances.
For each 1,000 Btu or 1 MBH of appliance input, the ratio of air is as follows:
•1,000 Btu (1 MBH) of fuel × 10 = ft³ combustion air
•1,000 Btu (1 MBH) of fuel × 5 = ft³ excess air
•1,000 Btu (1 MBH) of fuel × 15 = ft³ dilution air
•1,000 Btu (1 MBH) of fuel × 30 = ft³ total air

Causes of Incomplete Combustion
It is important to know that incomplete combustion occurs from causes other than insufficient air. For example, the
combustion process must maintain a minimum temperature. If at anytime the flame is quenched below that temperature, then
you may have incomplete combustion that produces toxic products.
CauseDescription
Flame temperatureThe combustion process must maintain a temperature of
approximately 1,300°F (649°C) for natural gas or 920°F
(495°C) for propane. If at any time the flame is quenched
below that temperature, you may have incomplete
combustion and toxic products. Conditions that cause the
temperature to drop below the ignition point may have
this effect. These conditions include impingement on the
cold metal surface of a heat exchanger or excessive cold
air that chills the flame front.

More Causes of Incomplete Combustion
CauseDescription
Cracked heat exchangerA heat exchanger is the component of a gas appliance that
takes the heat from the hot flue gases and transfers it to
the supply air that helps heat the building. On occasion,
this component will develop a crack that allows the supply
air to come into contact with the hot flue gases. This can
cause excessive air movement in the combustion chamber
and adversely affect the flame, causing incomplete
combustion. If the flame characteristics change as soon as
the supply air blower comes on, or if there is a change in
CO2 or O2 levels in the flue gases when the blower starts,
you may have a heat exchanger problem. On an induced
draft appliance, a crack will result in less air for the
combustion process and increased CO.

Blocked Venting Issues
CauseDescription
Blocked venting Natural draft applianceIf the venting on a gas appliance becomes blocked, the
flue gases will not be able to reach the outdoors and will
spill out of the draft hood and remain in the room. If the
products of combustion are not leaving the room, then
combustion air is not entering. In time, this lack of
combustion air will cause incomplete combustion and a
carbon monoxide condition. You can check spillage at the
draft hood with a smoke stick to see if there is positive or
negative pressure.
Induced draft applianceIf an appliance has a fan-assisted or induced-draft
combustion chamber, it has sensing devices that will shut
down the burner if the venting becomes blocked.

Negative Air Pressure
CauseDescription
Negative air pressureMany venting systems rely on natural draft to move the products of
combustion outdoors. Room pressure can affect this draft. If excessive air
exhausted from the building produces a negative pressure in the room,
the pressure will affect the combustion process and could cause
incomplete combustion.
Effects of Negative Pressure
Negative pressure in a room can:
•Pull products of combustion back into the living space
•Disrupt the proper air-fuel mixture
•Cause flame rollout or lifting
•Lead to dangerous carbon monoxide production

Flue Gas Condensation
Flue gas condensation is a process that involves the cooling of flue gas below its water dew point and the recovery of heat
released from the resulting condensation as low temperature heat.
When fuel is burned and the hot gases produced are exhausting through a heat exchanger, much of the heat is transferred to
the medium passing through the heat exchanger, thus raising the temperature of the medium. One of the hot gases produced
in the combustion process is water vapour (steam), which arises from burning the hydrogen content of the fuel. A condensing
appliance extracts additional heat from the flue gases by condensing this water vapour to liquid water, thus recovering its
latent heat. A typical increase of efficiency in the appliance can be as much as 10-20% of gain over a non-condensing
appliance.

Condensate Properties
The condensate produced is slightly acidic, 3-5 pH, so the choice of materials used in the wetted areas must be suitable. In high temperature areas, most
commonly used materials are aluminum alloys and stainless steel; in the low temperature areas, plastics, e.g., UPVC and polypropylene, are most cost effective.
The production of condensate also requires the installation of a secondary heat exchanger to remove the heat from the condensate and a condensate drainage
system.
Since the final exhaust from a condensing appliance has a lower temperature than the flue gas from a conventional non-condensing appliance, you must use an
approved BH venting system.
Condensing Appliance Benefits
•Higher energy efficiency
•Lower operating costs
•Reduced environmental impact
•Recovery of latent heat

Characteristics of a Stable Flame
A stable flame is a flame that does not waver, lift off the burner, or flash back into the mixing tube.
Flame colour and shape are characteristics of the flame and as such can only give an indication of flame quality. You must perform a combustion analysis to
accurately test flame quality and completeness of combustion, as well as for presence of toxic gases, i.e., carbon monoxide (CO).
Stable Flame Qualities
A stable atmospheric Bunsen burner flame has several colour zones. Each
of these zones marks a stage in the burning of gas.
Flame Zones
Color ZoneDescription
Inner coneThe inner cone is a thin blue
cone on the burner tip. The inner
cone marks the first step in the
burning process where burning
of gas happens to form products
such as aldehydes, alcohols,
carbon monoxide, and
hydrogen. The velocity of the
unburned gas-air mixture forms
the shape of the inner cone.

Flame Zones Continued
Color ZoneDescription
Outer coneThe outer cone is a darker, outer cone that
surrounds the inner cone. This is where the
secondary air diffuses into the flame. If
enough secondary air is present, and other
conditions are favourable, the complete
burning of products from the inner cone
happens here, yielding the final products,
carbon dioxide and water vapour.
Outer mantleThe outer mantle is a colourless mantle
that surrounds the outer cone. Since
complete burning usually happens at the
outer cone, there are almost no unburned
gases at the outer mantle. This nearly
invisible mantle only glows because of the
combustion products' high temperature.

Requirements of a Stable Flame
To achieve a stable flame on an atmospheric burner, you need to maintain a fine balance between the flame speed and the flow
velocity. Adjusting the primary air supply or the gas flow rates will change the flame speed and flow velocities. A properly adjusted
Bunsen-type burner flame is predominantly blue when you properly adjust the primary air.
Primary Air Supply
The primary air supply sets the flame characteristics. If
premixing of the proper amount of primary air with the gas
happens, the burner will provide a stable blue flame.
Adjustments to the air supply will cause the flame to change
shape and colour.

Air Adjustment Effects
AdjustmentDescription
Air increaseAs the percentage of primary air increases, the flame sharpens and
the inner cone gets smaller. When adjustment of the primary air
creates a 10% gas-air mixture for natural gas (or a 6% propane-air
mixture), the flame reaches its maximum speed. Beyond this point,
although adding more primary air increases flow velocity, the flame
speed slows down proportionately. The flame will then start to lift
off the burner port. Any further increase of primary air supply will
eventually cause complete flame liftoff.
Air decreaseWhen the percentage of primary air decreases, the burning speed
decreases since complete combustion requires more secondary air.
The flame gets longer, becomes more luminous, and burning speed
slows down. Further reduction of the primary air supply will result in
the appearance of yellow tips in the flames and the formation of
carbon. The flames will become completely yellow if all primary air is
shut off.

Air Supply and CO2 Levels
As primary or secondary air supply is decreased, the percentage of CO2 in the flue gases increases. The theoretical maximum CO2 produced during complete
combustion is 11.8% for natural gas or 13.8% for propane. In practice, when the flue gas percentage of CO2 reaches 10% or higher for natural gas (11.5% or higher for
propane), the air being supplied becomes insufficient, and carbon monoxide may be produced.
Gas Supply
The amount of gas-air mixture passing through a port—called port loading—is
also important for creating a stable flame. Burner port-loading is expressed as
the number of Btu/h per square inch of port-area.
You can change the port loading by altering either the orifice size or the gas
pressure (manifold pressure). For most applications using natural gas, a port
loading between 25,000 Btu/h and 30,000 Btu/h per square inch of port area
provides a stable flame.

indicate incomplete combustion and potential carbon monoxide production.

Condensing Appliances Review
Condensing Process
Flue gas condensation involves cooling flue gases below the
water dew point to recover latent heat from water vapor
condensation. This process can increase efficiency by 10-
20% compared to non-condensing appliances.
Special Requirements
•Corrosion-resistant materials (aluminum, stainless steel)
•Secondary heat exchanger
•Condensate drainage system
•Approved BH venting system

High Altitude Considerations
Pressure Changes
For every 2,000 ft rise in elevation, barometric pressure
reduces by approximately 1 psia from the sea level pressure
of 14.73 psia.
Effects on Combustion
•Gas becomes less dense at higher altitudes
•Gas flows more easily through orifices
•Input-to-oxygen ratio becomes unbalanced
•Adjustments needed for proper combustion

Carbon Monoxide Measurement
Air-Free CO Calculation
CO air free = 20.9 ÷ (20.9 - O2 measured) × measured CO
ppm
This calculation compensates for dilution effects when
measuring carbon monoxide levels in combustion products.
Alternative Method
CO (air-free) = CO (measured) × CO2 (ultimate) ÷ CO2
(measured)
Where:
•CO2 (ultimate) = 11.8% for natural gas
•CO2 (ultimate) = 13.8% for propane

Port Loading
The amount of gas-air mixture passing through a port—called port loading—is important for creating a stable flame. Burner
port-loading is expressed as the number of Btu/h per square inch of port-area.
Factors Affecting Port Loading
•Orifice size
•Gas pressure (manifold pressure)
•Port area
Optimal Port Loading
For most applications using natural gas, a port loading
between 25,000 Btu/h and 30,000 Btu/h per square inch of
port area provides a stable flame.
Proper port loading helps prevent issues like flame lifting,
flashback, and incomplete combustion.

Ignition Temperatures Comparison
The ignition temperature is the minimum temperature required to initiate self-sustained combustion of a fuel-air mixture. Natural gas requires a significantly higher temperature (1,300°F/700°C)
compared to propane (920°F/495°C). This difference affects burner design and safety considerations for each fuel type.

Air Requirements for Different Appliances
Different types of gas appliances require varying amounts of air for proper combustion. Atmospheric burners typically need the most air per unit of heat input, while more efficient designs like
condensing appliances can operate with less air while still achieving complete combustion.

CO2 Levels in Flue Gases
Excess Air (%)Natural Gas CO2 (%)Propane CO2 (%)
This chart shows how CO2 levels in flue gases decrease as excess air increases. The theoretical maximum CO2 levels (11.8% for natural gas and 13.8% for propane) occur with perfect combustion (0%
excess air). In practice, some excess air is always needed, which dilutes the CO2 concentration.

A combustible gas indicator (CGI) is an instrument for
detecting gas-air (or vapour-air) mixtures to determine the
explosive levels of the mixture.
A combustible gas indicator can save lives. A gas
technician/fitter should know how to use it and make sure
that it is accurate. A gas technician/fitter must become
thoroughly familiar with the operation and limitations of the
indicator and should be satisfied that the instrument is in
proper operating condition.
Solid-state combustible gas indicator

General Guidelines for CGI
Use
Audio Alarms
Audio alarms correspond to a
factory-set parts per million
(ppm) level of gas. You can shut
off the alarm in certain
circumstances to avoid causing
distress to the public.
Calibration
You should perform calibration
regularly and according to
manufacturer's instructions.
Accessories
Some CGI Units come with probes and hoses (including pumps and
battery packs) for remote sampling. Always use the appropriate
accessories when required.

Types of Combustible Gas Indicators
Solid-State Indicator
The solid-state CGI is a small, light hand-held Unit. It comes with a light-emitting diode (LED) display,
a digital readout, or an analogue dial indicator, and an audible alarm.
Some models are adjustable to detect several gases at one time. The readout indicates the gas level in
ppm or percent of lower explosive limit (LEL).
This type can sense gases at as little as 2–3 ppm of gas in air and is more commonly used and much
more sensitive than the filament type.
Filament-Type Indicator
The filament-type indicator works on the principle of catalytic combustion. The meter draws the air-
and-gas mixture through the sampling inlet and across the detector filament.
The filament consists of a catalytic material that ignites the mixture at a low temperature and then
registers the percent of explosive limits on a dial.
Be aware that the filament type is not as sensitive as the solid-state type and must be purged manually
before sampling.

Solid-State vs. Filament-Type Indicators
Solid-State Indicator
More sensitive, can detect gases at 2-3 ppm. Features LED
display, digital readout, or analogue dial with audible alarm.
Some models can detect several gases simultaneously.
Filament-Type Indicator
Works on catalytic combustion principle. Less sensitive than
solid-state type. Must be purged manually before sampling.
Draws air-gas mixture across detector filament to register
percent of explosive limits.

Conversion Charts for CGI
Each indicator is calibrated to a specific gas, and conversion charts are available if you wish to use to check for other gases or vapours.
Because each manufacturer makes many different models, you should be sure you have the correct instrument for the job at hand. An
instrument calibrated for a known gas at the manufacturer's plant (a standard calibration) is usually most suitable.
However, a CGI that is calibrated for one specific gas (such as hydrogen or methane) may not read correctly on other substances.
Therefore, make sure you have a CGI that can read the gas you are testing for.
A CGI calibrated for one specific gas may not read correctly on other substances. Always ensure you have the right equipment for the
job.

•Leak detection soap solution (bubbles)
•Pressure gauge or manometer
•Safety flashlight (Class 1)
•Pipe wrench

Step 2 & 3: Knock and Communicate
Step 2: Knock
When arriving at the premises with the suspected leak,
knock on the door. Do not use the doorbell, as this could
cause ignition if gas is present in the area of the doorbell's
power source.
Step 3: Communicate
•Identify yourself
•Inquire about the situation to obtain further facts
•Inform them:
•not to smoke
•not to use any appliances
•not to operate any electrical switch
•not to use any phone, pager, or cell phone in the
building

Step 4: Take a Reading
Natural Gas
If the natural gas appliances are in the basement, a good place to test
is in the basement stairwell, immediately after you enter the building,
near the top of the door.
Natural gas is lighter than air, with a specific gravity of approximately

## 0.60 . Consequently, it tends to rise or follow any path of least

resistance.
Propane
If the supply is propane, a good place to begin testing for propane
leaks is at floor level.
The specific gravity of propane is greater than that of air, it is heavier
and will tend to collect at lower levels.

CGI Reading Interpretation
Reading Above the LEL
If the CGI reading is above the LEL, which indicates that the
concentration of fuel is near or above the explosive limits:
•There is no time to waste
•You must make safe immediately and calmly
•Follow the steps for when the reading is above the LEL
Reading Well Below the LEL
If the CGI reading is well below the LEL, which is 4% for
natural gas and 2.4% for propane:
•There is a problem, but you have some margin for safety
•Proceed with caution
•A reading below LEL indicates that the immediate area
you are in has a margin of safety; however, the
immediate area of the leak could be above the LEL
•Follow the steps for when the reading is well below the
LEL

Step 5: Make Safe When Reading is Above LEL
Evacuate the occupant(s) - including you!
In larger buildings, you should notify and instruct the building manager to activate the emergency evacuation plan. Stay calm, but positive, when
directing people.
Do not cross-ventilate
When gas concentrations are near the explosive limits, cross-ventilating is dangerous—it is possible that you might move potentially explosive
concentrations of gas to a possible source of ignition. For this reason, it is not considered safe practice to cross-ventilate when the UEL reading is at
a critical point.
Turn off gas supply on your way out
On your way out, turn off service riser valve or propane cylinder/tank shutoff valve. Do not return to the building with a wrench to turn off the
main shutoff valve. Several deaths in the industry have occurred from such actions.
Call for help from a safe distance
Call for help using a telephone located at a safe distance from the area of the leak. Provide the property address, actions taken, information on
the suspected cause, types of crew and equipment required, and any other backup personnel required.
Do not return to the building
Keep everyone, after evacuation, at a safe distance from the hazard area. Following building evacuation, stay clear and keep others at a safe
distance. Remember that buildings are replaceable, lives aren't.

Step 5: Make Safe When
Reading is Below LEL
Remain calm
The guidelines for making
safe when the reading is
below LEL are less drastic
than for when there is
imminent danger.
Ventilate the area
Operate exhaust fans,
opening windows and
doors, and forced air
ventilation, if available.
Fresh air ventilation will
keep concentrations low.
For basement gas concentration
If gas is concentrating in a basement with a below LEL reading,
open windows on each end of the basement. Mount a portable
cooling fan in one window to blow air out. Make-up air will exhaust
through the opposite window, creating a cross-draft.

Step 6: Cut Off Ignition Sources
When gas concentrations are below the LEL, you can safely cut
off potential ignition sources by:
•Opening the master breaker at the electrical panel
•Turning off valves on lines supplying the various gas
appliances
Only cut off ignition sources when gas concentrations are
confirmed to be below the LEL. This includes electrical panels
and gas supply valves.

Step 7: Determine Source of
Leak
Note that odorants are not completely effective as a warning agent in all
cases. You can properly odorized propane at a concentration of 1/5th of
its LEL and properly odorized natural gas with the average nose at a
concentration of approximately 500 ppm.
An older style combustible gas indicator, operating on the 0–100 LEL
(0.5%) range, can detect concentrations of natural gas down to 1,000
ppm. In other words, the average nose may be twice as sensitive as the
standard catalytic combustion scale on a combustible gas indicator. The
nose and CGI together can help determine the source of a gas leak.

Determining Leak Source by Smell and Reading
Faint smell and strong reading
Likely an outside, below-ground leak that has infiltrated the building
•Gas diffuses through soil seeking a venting location
•Often finds its way into conduit systems, sewer lines, manholes, vaults or pits, as well as building
foundations
•Odorant compounds (mercaptans) tend to adhere to soil particles; soil acts as a filter for the odour
molecules
•By the time gas infiltrates buildings, the odour may be entirely absent
Strong smell
Likely a leak inside the building
•If there is a noticeable smell of fuel and the reading is below the LEL, you are safe to continue to monitor the
free atmosphere in the basement
•Check all potential leak points including conduit entry points, gas service entry, below-grade cracks in the
basement walls, etc.

Actions for Outside, Below-
Ground Leaks
Call the gas utility (supplier)
You should call the gas utility (supplier) to have the area tested.
Keep in mind that time is of the essence.
Assess the situation outside
At this point you should go outside to "assess the situation on the
street". You may perceive evidence of recent construction or
other activity that could have damaged the pipeline or
underground propane service line.
Shut off propane supply if applicable
Shut off the propane cylinder/tank service valve if the gas
supply to the premises is propane. Take all precautions.

Actions for Inside Leaks
Check potential leak points
•All conduit entry points
•The gas service entry
•Below-grade cracks in the basement walls
•Floor drains and sump pump holes
•Ceiling atmosphere
•The piping
•Low-lying areas
•Fittings and manifolds of appliances
•Other points where gas could leak or collect
Additional tests
•Take dial-gauge/manometer test reading
•Do soap test
•Shut off all appliances at service valves and listen for the
sound of gas passing

Investigating Incomplete Combustion
If, when responding to an odour call, you determine that the
odour is not a natural gas or propane leak, you should check
for carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is a colourless, toxic
gas with a specific gravity of 0.98.
Whilst carbon monoxide is odourless by itself, the creation
of aldehydes and sulphur dioxide, which are irritating and
toxic substances may cause a pungent odour that
sometimes accompanies CO.
Technicians/Fitters should test for carbon monoxide as they
enter a structure. Any increase over outside ambient levels
should be investigated to determine the source.
Always test for carbon monoxide when entering a structure,
especially when responding to odor complaints that aren't
clearly gas leaks.

Carbon Monoxide: A Direct and Cumulative Poison
Carbon monoxide is a product of incomplete combustion. It is a
direct and cumulative poison. Carbon monoxide bonds with
blood hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin.
Carbon monoxide bonds with hemoglobin 200 times easier than
oxygen. CO replaces oxygen in the blood until it completely
overcomes the body.
Death from CO occurs rapidly at high concentrations. The victim
inhaling the toxic concentration of the gas becomes helpless
before realizing that danger exists.
Chronic exposure to low levels of carbon monoxide can
compound preexisting health conditions and is often
misdiagnosed due to common symptoms like headache, nausea,
vomiting, head stuffiness, and fatigue.
Incomplete combustion produces carbon monoxide, which can
be deadly even in small amounts.

CO Testers: Pump-Type
Tube-type testers
Draeger and Gastec are two well-
known manufacturers of tube-type
CO testers. This type of tester uses a
single-use tube that indicates the
concentration of gas by the
discoloration of a dry chemical
contained in the tube. The higher the
concentration of gas present, the
greater the extent of the
discoloration.
Liquid-type testers
Another common CO tester is the
liquid-type Unit. This type of tester is
partially filled with a liquid that
absorbs CO. The higher the
concentration of CO present, the
greater the expansion of the liquid.
The amount of expansion is measured
on a scale on the side of the tube.
Unlike the tube tester, the liquid tester
can help take several samples without
having to change the chemicals.
Continuous sampling testers
These testers take a continuous
sample of the gas through a sampling
tube inserted into the area being
tested. Readings are displayed on a
dial indicator. Some Units provide a
printout of the readings for future
reference.

CO Testers: Electronic Type
Electronic CO testers, like the Bacharach Monoxor® III Unit,
are light-weight, portable, hand-held solid-state
instruments with continuous readout digital displays.
They can measure and display CO levels from 0 to 2,000
ppm.
To take a reading, the operator inserts the attached sensor
probe into the flue or airspace being sampled and reads the
indicated value on the tester display.
Electronic CO testers provide quick, accurate readings and
are easier to use than traditional pump-type testers.

Investigating Incomplete Combustion: Step 1
Check products of
combustion
Check the products of combustion
on all vented appliances (on an air-
free basis). You are looking for high
levels of carbon monoxide (CO).
If CO levels are high
If a vented appliance produces more
than 400 ppm of CO air-free and
cannot be adjusted to produce less,
disconnect and red-tag the
appliance. Under normal operation,
an appliance should produce less
than 50 ppm of CO (air-free).
In any situation where a hazardous
condition exists, inform the customer
that the appliance needs repair
before gas activation is possible.
Vented appliances should never
produce more than 400 ppm of CO
on an air-free basis.
If products of combustion test
are normal
Check the house atmosphere for CO.
If the inside atmosphere CO level
exceeds 35 ppm, ventilate the
building and shut off the appliances.
In any situation where a hazardous
condition exists, inform the customer
that the appliance needs repair
before gas activation is possible.

Investigating Incomplete Combustion: Step 2
Check appliance venting system
Check that the venting system is working properly by
watching the venting action with the appliances turned off,
and again when they are turned on.
If the chimney or vent is reversing or down drafting, try to
determine the cause by checking for the following:
•An active fireplace or open fireplace damper
•Exhaust fans
•Adequate combustion and ventilation air
•Proper chimney or vent height
•Proper termination location
•Proper rain cap on Type B vent
Proper venting is critical to prevent carbon monoxide buildup.
Check for proper draft and ensure all components are
correctly installed.

Investigating Incomplete Combustion: Step 3
Check other fuel-burning appliances
Check other fuel-burning appliances such as:
•Gas ovens
•Gas ranges
•Gas fireplaces
•Gas water heaters
•Wood stoves
•Wood furnaces
•Oil-fired vented appliances
Check venting system
Check the sizing of the venting system to ensure it is
appropriate for the number and types of appliances.
Check the condition of the venting system and clean out any
obvious debris in the chimney cleanout.

Investigating Incomplete Combustion: Step 4
Check furnace heat exchanger
Check the furnace heat exchanger for cracks. If you find cracks, inform the
customer that the heat exchanger needs replacement or that a new
furnace is required.
Check secondary heat exchanger
Check the furnace for a secondary heat exchanger. If there is one installed,
examine it to determine whether it is an acceptable type and whether it is in
good condition.

Investigating Incomplete
Combustion: Step 5
Clock the gas meter
Clock the gas meter and
determine the input for
each vented residential gas
appliance.
Check commercial
equipment
Check all industrial and
commercial equipment, if
installed.
Check for other causes of odours
Check for other causes of odours, when unable to find, such as
paint and solvent fumes, kerosene heaters, and auto engines
operating.

Effects of Corrosive Vapours
Experience has shown that contaminants in the combustion air
almost always causes corrosion of gas-fired equipment.
The most common corrosive element is a member of the family
of substances known as chlorinated hydrocarbons. These
materials are solvents, or refrigerants. When heated, the
molecules of these compounds break down to form a variety of
substances, some of which are very corrosive.
Corrosive vapors can severely damage gas equipment, leading
to premature failure and potentially dangerous conditions.

Common Corrosive Substances
Cleaning Products
•Materials used for degreasing
metal parts
•Materials used for cleaning
jewelry, electronic components,
etc.
•Solvents for removing grease,
wax, or printing ink
•Paint and varnish strippers
•Dry cleaning solvents
•Bleaches
Adhesives
•Glues of many types, except
those with a water base
Aerosols
•Propellants used in aerosol sprays
Other Substances
•Freon-type refrigerants
•Swimming pool chlorine
•Kitty litter

Identifying Corrosive Substances
When used in a solvent form, corrosive materials are often clear, colourless, watery liquids. They are normally
nonflammable and relatively nontoxic. When mixed with glues, they are difficult or impossible to identify without
testing.
Solid substances do not usually cause corrosion.
For positive identification, you need to know the chemical constituents of the suspect materials. The easiest way is to
read them off the container label. If the chemical name of a solvent-type substance contains the letters "chlor" or "fluor",
you can be almost certain you have found the problem material.
Known corrosion-causing substances:
•Chlordane
•Refrigerants
•Methylene chloride
•Perchloride
•Trichlorophenol
•Trichlorfon

Chemistry of Corrosion
The equation below shows, in a simplified manner, one of the possible reactions that can
occur when a chlorinated hydrocarbon (methylene chloride, in this example) is heated in
air:
CH₂Cl₂ + O₂ = CO₂ + 2HCl
methylene chloride + oxygen = carbon dioxide + hydrogen chloride
In this reaction, the methylene chloride combines with oxygen to produce the gases
carbon dioxide and hydrogen chloride.
Hydrogen chloride gas is very soluble in water. In the presence of the slightest trace of
water, it forms hydrochloric acid. This acid can attack various appliances and heating
system components.
When chlorinated hydrocarbons are heated during combustion, they can form
hydrochloric acid, which is extremely corrosive to metal components.

Appliances Vulnerable to Corrosion
Furnace Heat
Exchangers
At the beginning and end of
each burner cycle, the heat
exchanger is relatively cool,
allowing water and acid to form.
Water Heaters
During high draws, the heat
exchanger temperatures are
quite low. More condensation
occurs during this time, leading
to higher corrosion rates.
Unit Heaters
These are also vulnerable to
corrosion from condensation.
Boilers
Often least affected because
inner surfaces are nearly always
hot enough to prevent
condensation. However, boilers
with finned tubes and swimming
pool heaters frequently have
condensation problems.

Spotting Corrosion
In appearance, the corrosion looks like ordinary rust—it can
be a fine red powder or large rusty scales or flakes.
One of the additional characteristics of this type of corrosion
is the presence of whitish, powdery streaks that run down
and dry on galvanized vents (aluminum vents are less
affected).
In cases of fresh corrosion, the streaks will be wet and
appear oily. The inner surfaces show a slight amount of
white powder. They tend to last fairly well, but get thinner
and thinner with time.
Corroded venting due to leaking

Corrective Measures for
Corrosion
Installation Precaution
Do not install an appliance in a room
that has an atmosphere containing
corrosive vapours, such as that
found in a dry-cleaning
establishment.
Finding Alternatives
When you find corrosion to be
causing the deterioration of gas-
burning equipment, you must take
corrective measures before
replacing the equipment. When
possible, encourage the customer to
find a replacement for the corrosive
substance.
Industrial Applications
In industrial applications, it is often impossible to cure the problem completely.
The chlorinated hydrocarbon causing the corrosion is often crucial to plant
operation, with no acceptable replacement substance.

Reducing Corrosion Problems
Ventilated Storage
Store, transfer, and use the
solvent in a closed, fan-
ventilated room. No gas-
fired equipment should be in
the room. Doors leading to
this room should be well-
sealed and closed at all
times.
Minimize Open
Containers
Try to avoid open containers
of solvent. Often, you can
find many small containers
of solvent around the plant
or in the home that are not
really needed.
Consider Direct Vent
Systems
Direct vent and roof-
mounted heaters are best, as
long as all combustion air
comes from outdoors. Be
aware that vents or exhaust
fans that dump
contaminated air at roof
level should not be near the
intake of a roof unit or direct
vent appliance.
Consider Hot Water
Heating
Hot water or steam heating
is the next best choice. Place
a boiler or water heater in an
enclosed area away from the
solvent. To avoid
condensation problems, pay
careful attention to finned-
tube boiler installations.

Air Categories Review
Primary AirSecondary AirExcess AirDilution Air
Understanding the different categories of air is essential for proper combustion analysis. Primary air mixes with fuel before ignition, secondary air is supplied around flames, excess air ensures complete
combustion, and dilution air cools vent gases and provides air to draft control devices. Total air is the sum of all these requirements.

Combustible Gas Indicator Selection
When selecting a combustible gas indicator, ensure it's calibrated for the specific gas you're testing for. Each manufacturer makes many different
models, so be sure you have the correct instrument for the job at hand. An instrument calibrated for a known gas at the manufacturer's plant (a
standard calibration) is usually most suitable.

6400 ppm, severe symptoms can occur in just 1-2 minutes, with death possible in 10-15 minutes.

Corrosive Substances Identification
For positive identification of corrosive substances, check the chemical constituents on the container label. If the chemical name contains the letters "chlor"
or "fluor", it's likely a corrosion-causing substance. Examples include chlordane, methylene chloride, perchloride, trichlorophenol, and trichlorfon.

Corrosion Effects on Gas Equipment

Essential for detecting gas-air mixtures and determining explosive levels. Available in solid-state and filament types, with solid-state being more sensitive and
commonly used.
Leak Detection Soap Solution
Used to visually identify the exact location of gas leaks by forming bubbles when applied to fittings, connections, and other potential leak points.
Pressure Gauge/Manometer

Chemistry of Corrosion in Gas Equipment
Chemical Reaction
CH₂Cl₂ + O₂ = CO₂ + 2HCl
When methylene chloride (a common chlorinated hydrocarbon) is heated in air, it combines with
oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen chloride gas.
Hydrogen chloride gas is very soluble in water. In the presence of the slightest trace of water, it forms
hydrochloric acid, which is extremely corrosive to most metals.
This reaction occurs during the combustion process when chlorinated hydrocarbons are present in the
combustion air.
Condensation Points
At the beginning and end of each burner cycle, the heat exchanger is relatively cool. Water in the
combustion products can condense in small amounts during these two brief times.
The hydrogen chloride dissolves in this water to form hydrochloric acid, which attacks the metal
components.
In water heaters during high draws, the heat exchanger temperatures are quite low, leading to more
condensation and potentially higher corrosion rates.
