Critical Pressure
Negative pressure limit for safe
operation
Air is required for the combustion process to meet three requirements: air for combustion, dilution air for the draft diverter,
and air for ventilation. To meet these requirements, for every 1000 Btu (0.293 kW) produced by burning natural gas or
propane, up to 30 ft³ (0.84 m³) of air may be required. Additional air may be needed to compensate for the operation of range
hoods, clothes dryers, and exhaust fans, which can cause a negative pressure condition in the building. A negative pressure of
more than 0.02 inch w.c. (5 Pa) can cause natural draft appliances to spill the products of combustion into the building.

Types of Draft
Natural Draft
It is a draft other than mechanical draft. For example, a draft
can be developed by the difference in temperature of hot
gases in a vent or chimney and outdoor air temperature.
The natural-draft vent, or gravity vent, relies on the upward
movement of hot gases creating a slight negative pressure
in the vent or chimney. Blowers are not needed to assist
draft with a gravity vent.
Mechanical Draft
It is the draft that a mechanical device (e.g., fan, blower,
aspirator) produces and that may supplement natural draft.
Its two main types are:
•Forced draft - a product of a mechanical device
upstream from the combustion zone of an appliance
•Induced draft - a product of a mechanical device
downstream from the combustion zone of an appliance

Draft Effects: Downdraft
Downdraft (also called backdraft) is a condition of the venting system in
which a draft is reversed down and can cause products of combustion to
spill.
This diagram illustrates how downdraft can occur in a venting system,
causing combustion products to spill into the living space instead of
being safely vented outdoors. This is a dangerous condition that can lead
to carbon monoxide exposure.

Draft Effects: Stack Effect
Heat Generation
Combustion creates hot gases
Temperature Difference
Hot gases are less dense than surrounding air
Upward Movement
Less dense gases rise through the vertical passage
Continuous Flow
Creates ongoing draft as long as temperature difference exists
Stack effect is the tendency of heated gas to rise in a vertical passage such as a chimney, a small enclosure, or a stairwell. This natural phenomenon is the principle behind natural draft
venting systems.

Draft Effects: Wind Effect
Wind Movement
Air flows across vent termination
Pressure Change
Creates negative (suction) pressure
at termination
Increased Draft
Enhances upward flow of combustion
gases
Eddy Currents
Can create variable pressure
conditions
Wind effect is the likelihood of negative (suction) pressure at the vent termination that will increase draft to result from wind
and eddy currents. This effect can enhance the performance of a venting system but can also cause issues if not properly
accounted for in the system design.

Over-fire Pressure
Definition
Over-fire draft is the pressure measured over the flame in
the combustion chamber compared to the pressure of
the outside of the combustion chamber.
Positive Over-fire Draft
Has a positive pressure over the fire
Negative Over-fire Draft
Has a negative pressure over the fire
Neutral Over-fire Draft
Has a neutral pressure over the fire
To prevent flue gas spillage, ensure that the heat exchanger and any portion of the venting system that is under positive
pressure have sealing.

Theoretical Stack Draft
The quantity of theoretical draft in a stack, measured in inches of water
column (or in Pascals), is directly proportional to the absolute
temperature difference between the stack gas and its surroundings, and
to the height of the stack. Draft does not depend on the diameter of the
stack.
Stack Temperature
Draft will be greatest when
average stack temperature
is highest
Outdoor Temperature
Draft will be greatest when
outdoor air temperature is
lowest
Stack Height
Draft will be greatest when stack height is greatest

Theoretical Stack Draft Formula
Imperial Formula
D = 7.6 × H × (1/Ta - 1/Ts)
Where:
•D = theoretical draft (inches w.c.)
•Ts = average stack temperature (°R)
•Ta = outside temperature (°R)
•H = stack height (ft)
•7.6 = constant
Metric Formula
D = 3450 × H × (1/Ta - 1/Ts)
Where:
•D = theoretical draft (Pa)
•Ts = average stack temperature (K)
•Ta = outside temperature (K)
•H = stack height (m)
•3450 = constant
To take into account the heat lost through the stack walls as the hot gases pass through the stack, the average stack
temperature (Ts) is the point halfway between the inlet temperature at the bottom and the outlet temperature at the top of
the stack.

Vent Gas Temperature
1
Higher Temperature
Hotter vent gases are lighter
Greater Force
Creates stronger expulsion through vent
3
Better Performance
Results in more effective venting
Since the temperature inside a natural draft vent system represents the power available to operate the vent, the Btu/h (kW)
capacity of the vent depends on the temperature. The hotter the vent gases, the lighter they are, and the greater the force that
expels them through the vent. Average stack temperature is determined by taking an average of the temperature at the flue
collar and the temperature at the vent termination.

Heat Loss in Venting Systems
Effects of Heat Loss
As hot flue gases travel through the vent system, they lose
heat through the walls of the vent. As the gases cool, they
become denser and the draft effect is lessened.
This heat loss can significantly impact the performance of
natural draft venting systems, potentially leading to
condensation and draft problems.
Vent Material Considerations
•Single-wall metal vents conduct heat readily to the
surrounding air
•Some non-metallic materials used for vents may absorb
large amounts of heat
•Double-wall, metal vents are often preferred because of
the insulating quality of the air space between the walls
•The relatively small mass of metal in the inner wall of
double-wall vents does not absorb much heat

Minimizing Heat Loss
Installation Requirements
CSA B149.1 and the vent manufacturer's instructions require the
installation of the vent in an insulated space or its insulation
Exceptions
Insulation not required where the vent rises above the roof line or
passes through an outside wall
Preferred Materials
Double-wall vents with air space insulation reduce heat loss
Temperature Maintenance
Proper insulation helps maintain flue gas temperature for better
draft

Heat Reclaimers
Definition
A heat reclaimer is a device that you may install externally to a venting system to extract heat
from flue gases.
Residential Applications
Never use a heat reclaimer with a gas-fired appliance that is installed in a dwelling unit, mobile
home, or recreational vehicle unless it is approved for the application and installed in
accordance with the manufacturer's certified installation instructions.
Commercial Applications
A heat reclaimer installed on a commercial or industrial gas-fired appliance must have approval
for the application and be installed in accordance with the manufacturer's installation
instructions.
Code Requirements
The Gas Codes have special requirements for heat reclaimers that must be followed for safe
operation.

Vent Height Considerations
Taller Columns
The taller the columns of hot gases, the greater the driving force
Increased Draft
In general, increasing the vent height increases the draft
Flow Resistance
Increased total length also increases the resistance to flow
Practical Limit
There will be a limit at which no further benefit will be gained
You do not usually encounter this practical limit in actual practice, as most residential
and commercial installations fall well within the effective range of vent heights.

Vent System Capacity
Input Relationship
Volume of flue gases is proportional
to Btu/h input
Maximum Capacity
Every vent has a maximum input limit
2
Minimum Capacity
Each vent has a minimum input
below which gases can condense
3
Operating Range
Vent operates properly only between
minimum and maximum inputs
When the maximum limit is exceeded, a portion of the combustion products will not enter the vent, but will spill from the
draft-hood into the surrounding space. The range between the maximum and minimum inputs is called vent capacity.

Venting System Components Overview
A venting system consists of everything involved in the venting of flue gases to the outdoors, including components that are integral to the appliance that affect venting.
Natural Draft Vent Systems
Include all components that form the vent itself, including:
•Vent connectors
•Type B vent
•Tile or other certified liner
•Inspection caps
•Cleanouts
•Firestops
•Supports
•Roof flashing
•Storm collar
•Rain cap
Also includes components integral to the appliance, such as combustion air inlets on
the appliance cabinet and a manufacturer-supplied draft-hood.
Mechanical Draft Vent Systems
Components include:
•Blower
•Special vent material (BH vent)
•Termination kits
•Condensate traps
•Drainage equipment
Do not alter any of these components, as alteration can lead to failure of the system
or improper venting that can result in the production of carbon monoxide (CO) into
the building.

Common Venting System Components
Rain Cap/Vent Top
Protects weather elements and foreign objects from entering the vent and reduces downdrafts caused by wind
Storm Collar
Provides additional protection from water getting seeping between the vent and the roof flashing
Roof Flashing
Fitted around the vent to seal the roof penetration from rain and snow

More Venting System Components
Fire Stop Spacers
Help contain the fire by restricting the stack effect during the fire. Firestops are required at each ceiling/floor penetration including an attic and are not required at
the roof penetration.
Supports
Maintain clearances and carry the weight of the venting system to ensure proper installation and operation.
Complete Assembly
A venting system operates because a draft exists. Where required, the outdoor air supply is also considered part of the venting system.

Draft Control Devices
The majority of modern, highly efficient appliances a gasfitter will install have special venting systems that operate on mechanical draft. Lower efficient natural draft appliances rely on an external draft control device to maintain a neutral or slightly negative over-
fire draft.
Types of Draft Control Devices
Two types of "draft control" devices used on natural draft appliances are:
•Draft hood/diverter
•Barometric damper
These draft control devices control the over-fire draft by the introduction of dilution air, breaking the stack effect on the
combustion chamber.
Purposes of Draft Control Devices
1.Control the over-fire draft by introducing dilution air
2.Relieve any downdrafts from entering the combustion chamber of the appliance
3.Allow the appliance to spill through the relief opening if the appliance vent is blocked or restricted

Draft Hood Operation
Combustion Process
Appliance burns fuel and produces hot flue gases
Dilution Air Introduction
Draft hood allows room air to mix with flue gases
Draft Stabilization
Maintains consistent draft conditions at the appliance
Downdraft Protection
Prevents downdrafts from affecting combustion process
A draft hood is a device built into an appliance or made a part of the vent connector that is designed to provide for the ready escape of the products of combustion in the event of no draft,
backdraft, or stoppage beyond the draft hood. It also neutralizes the effect of stack action of the chimney or gas vent upon the operation of the appliance.

Barometric Damper Operation
Pressure Sensing
Damper responds to pressure
changes in the vent
Automatic Adjustment
Door opens or closes based on draft
conditions
Dilution Air Control
Allows precise amount of room air to
enter vent
3
Draft Regulation
Maintains consistent draft at the
appliance
A barometric damper is a mechanical device that automatically adjusts to maintain a constant draft in the vent system. It
consists of a weighted door that opens or closes in response to changes in draft pressure, allowing more or less dilution air to
enter the vent system as needed.

Venting System Types
Natural Draft Systems
Rely on the natural buoyancy of hot flue gases to create
draft. Typically used with Category I appliances. Include
draft hoods or barometric dampers to control draft.
Fan-Assisted Systems
Use a small fan at the appliance to help overcome flow
resistance in the heat exchanger. Still rely on natural draft
in the vent system itself. Common in mid-efficiency
furnaces.
Power Vented Systems
Use a blower to force flue gases through the vent system.
Can be side-wall vented. Used with Category III
appliances and some Category I and IV appliances.
Direct Vent Systems
Draw combustion air directly from outdoors and vent flue
gases directly outdoors through a sealed system.
Common in high-efficiency appliances.

Type B Vent
Construction
Type B vent is a factory-made, double-wall vent pipe
consisting of:
•An inner pipe of aluminum or stainless steel
•An outer wall of galvanized steel or aluminum
•An air space between the two walls that provides
insulation
Applications
Type B vent is designed for:
•Venting Category I gas appliances
•Maintaining flue gas temperature to prevent
condensation
•Reducing clearance to combustible materials
•Improving draft performance
Type B vent must be installed according to manufacturer's
instructions and code requirements.

Type BH Vent
Special Vent Material
Designed for positive pressure and/or condensing applications
Sealed Joints
All joints must be sealed to prevent leakage of flue gases
Corrosion Resistant
Made from materials that can withstand acidic condensate
Applications
Used with Category III and IV appliances
Type BH vent is a special venting material designed for use with high-efficiency
and positive pressure appliances. It is certified to ULC-S636 standard in Canada
and must be installed according to manufacturer's instructions.

Masonry Chimneys
Traditional Venting
Masonry chimneys have been used for centuries to vent
combustion appliances. They are constructed of brick,
stone, or concrete blocks with a clay tile liner.
When used for venting gas appliances, masonry chimneys
must:
•Be properly lined with a suitable material
•Be sized correctly for the appliance(s) being vented
•Be in good condition with no cracks or deterioration
•Have proper clearance to combustible materials
Common Issues
Masonry chimneys can present several challenges when
used for venting gas appliances:
•Large thermal mass can cause condensation with
modern appliances
•Often oversized for replacement appliances
•May have deteriorated liners or mortar joints
•Can be affected by wind and pressure conditions
Relining with appropriate materials is often required when
connecting gas appliances to existing masonry chimneys.

Chimney Liners
Clay Tile Liners
Traditional material for lining masonry
chimneys. Must be in good condition
with no cracks or missing pieces. May
not be suitable for condensing
appliances due to potential for
deterioration from acidic condensate.
Metal Liners
Stainless steel or aluminum liners can
be installed inside existing chimneys.
Provide better performance with
modern appliances. Available in flexible
or rigid forms to accommodate
different chimney configurations.
Cast-in-Place Liners
Lightweight, cement-based product
that is poured or pumped into the
chimney to create a seamless liner.
Good for irregular or damaged
chimneys. Provides excellent insulation
and sealing properties.

Vent Connectors
Purpose
Vent connectors join the appliance flue collar to the vertical portion of the venting
system
Materials
May be single-wall or double-wall metal depending on the application and
clearance requirements
Installation Requirements
Must be installed with proper slope, support, and clearances according to
code requirements
Sizing Considerations
Must be properly sized based on appliance input and connector length
Vent connectors are an important part of the venting system and must be installed
correctly to ensure proper draft and safe operation of the appliance. They should be as
short and straight as possible, with minimal bends to reduce resistance to flow.

Vent Terminations
Vertical Terminations
Traditional method of terminating vents through the roof. Requires proper clearance above the roof line and appropriate rain cap to prevent water entry while
allowing flue gases to exit.
Horizontal Terminations
Common with power-vented and direct-vent appliances. Must be located away from building openings, corners, and other areas where flue gases could re-enter
the building or affect adjacent properties.
Concentric Terminations
Used with direct-vent systems to provide both combustion air intake and flue gas exhaust through a single wall or roof penetration. Reduces the number of building
penetrations required.

Condensate Management
Condensate Formation
High-efficiency appliances produce acidic condensate
Collection System
Condensate traps and drains collect the liquid
Neutralization
May require treatment before disposal
Proper Disposal
Connected to appropriate drain system
Category II and IV appliances produce condensate that must be properly managed.
The condensate is acidic (typically pH 3-5) and can damage materials it contacts.
Proper condensate management includes collection, possible neutralization, and
disposal according to local codes.

venting materials and are critical for fire safety.

Common Venting
Definition
Common venting refers to the practice of connecting two or
more appliances to a single vertical vent or chimney. This
approach is often used in residential and light commercial
applications to simplify venting and reduce the number of
roof or wall penetrations.
Common venting is only permitted for certain types of
appliances and must be carefully designed to ensure proper
operation of all connected appliances.
Requirements
•Only Category I appliances may be common vented
•Appliances must be located on the same floor
•Proper sizing using approved methods is critical
•Each appliance must have its own draft hood or
barometric damper
•Connectors must enter the common vent at different
levels if entering from opposite sides
•Larger appliance connector should be connected to the
common vent first

Vent Sizing Principles
Appliance Input
Based on the Btu/h rating of the appliance(s)
Vent Height
Measured from draft hood to termination
Connector Length and Rise
Affects overall system performance
Sizing Tables
Use approved tables from codes or standards
Proper vent sizing is critical for safe and efficient operation of gas appliances. Undersized vents can cause spillage of combustion products,
while oversized vents can lead to condensation and deterioration of the venting system.

Vent Sizing Methods
Sizing Tables
The most common method uses tables in codes and
standards such as the National Fuel Gas Code (NFPA
54/ANSI Z223.1) in the US or CSA B149.1 in Canada.
Tables account for appliance input, vent height, and
connector configuration.
Manufacturer's Instructions
Always follow the appliance manufacturer's specific
venting instructions, which may include dedicated sizing
charts for their equipment. These take precedence over
general code tables.
Engineering Calculations
For complex or unusual installations, engineering
calculations may be required. These consider factors like
draft requirements, flow resistance, and temperature
profiles.
Computer Programs
Specialized software is available for vent sizing,
particularly for complex commercial and industrial
applications. These programs can model system
performance under various conditions.

Vent Installation Best Practices
Follow Instructions
Always follow manufacturer's
installation instructions for both
the appliance and venting
components
Maintain Proper Slope
Horizontal sections should slope
upward away from the appliance
at least 1/4 inch per foot
Provide Adequate
Support
Use proper supports at specified
intervals to prevent sagging and
maintain clearances
Seal Joints Properly
Use approved methods and materials for joining vent
sections
5
Maintain Clearances
Ensure proper clearances to combustible materials are
maintained throughout the system

Vent Inspection Procedures
Visual Examination
Check for proper installation, support, slope, and clearances
Joint Inspection
Verify all joints are properly connected and sealed where required
Clearance Verification
Confirm proper clearances to combustible materials throughout the system
Termination Check
Ensure proper termination location and clearances from building openings
Draft Testing
Verify proper draft and absence of spillage under normal operating conditions

Draft Testing Methods
Draft Gauge Measurement
A draft gauge or manometer can be used to measure the pressure in the vent connector or at the draft hood. This measurement should be compared to
manufacturer's specifications to verify proper operation.
Smoke Test
A smoke pencil or match can be used to check for proper draft at the draft hood. Smoke should be drawn into the draft hood opening, indicating proper draft. Any
spillage indicates a potential venting problem.
Combustion Analysis
Modern combustion analyzers can measure draft along with other combustion parameters like oxygen, carbon monoxide, and efficiency. This provides a
comprehensive assessment of appliance and venting system performance.

Air Requirements Overview
Combustion Air
Air needed for the actual burning of
fuel
Dilution Air
Air that mixes with flue gases in draft
hood
Ventilation Air
Air for cooling and general ventilation
Building Pressure
Maintaining neutral or slightly
positive pressure
Air is required for the combustion process to meet three requirements: air for combustion (for every 1000 Btu produced by any
fuel, 10 ft³ of air is required, plus additional excess air), dilution air for the draft diverter, and air for ventilation. For every 1000
Btu (0.293 kW) produced by burning natural gas or propane, up to 30 ft³ (0.84 m³) of air may be required.

Air Supply Methods
Indoor Air
When the building has sufficient volume and air infiltration,
indoor air may be used for combustion, dilution, and
ventilation. This is known as using air from inside the
building or "indoor combustion air."
Requirements:
•Building must have sufficient volume based on appliance
input
•Adequate infiltration must be present
•No significant negative pressure conditions
•No competing exhaust systems that could cause
depressurization
Outdoor Air
When indoor air is insufficient or when appliances are
installed in confined spaces, outdoor air must be provided.
This can be accomplished through:
•Direct openings to outdoors
•Vertical ducts
•Horizontal ducts
•Combination of methods
•Engineered systems
The size and configuration of openings depend on the
appliance input and the method used.

These sizing requirements are based on the total input of all appliances in the space.
Different codes may have slightly different requirements, so always consult the
applicable code for your jurisdiction.

Air Requirements for Large Equipment
Equipment Over 400 MBtu/h
Requires special consideration and often engineered
solutions
Commercial Applications
May need dedicated mechanical ventilation systems
Engineered Systems
Designed specifically for the application and equipment
Code Requirements
Must comply with specific provisions for large equipment
For equipment with inputs over 400 MBtu/h, standard sizing tables and methods may not be sufficient. These installations often
require engineered systems designed by qualified professionals to ensure adequate air supply and proper venting.

Negative Pressure Concerns
Modern Construction
Tighter building envelopes reduce natural infiltration
Exhaust Systems
Range hoods, clothes dryers, and exhaust fans remove air
Negative Pressure
Can exceed 0.02 inch w.c. (5 Pa) in some conditions
Appliance Spillage
Natural draft appliances may spill combustion products
Even more additional air may have to be provided to compensate for the operation of range
hoods, clothes dryers, and exhaust fans, which can cause a negative pressure condition in
the building. A negative pressure of more than 0.02 inch w.c. (5 Pa) can cause natural draft
appliances (those with draft control devices) to spill the products of combustion into the
building.

Direct Vent Systems
Definition and Operation
Direct vent systems draw combustion air directly from
outdoors and vent combustion products directly outdoors
through a sealed system. This approach isolates the
combustion process from the indoor environment,
providing several advantages:
•Not affected by indoor air quality or pressure
•Can be installed in confined spaces without additional air
openings
•Improved safety by reducing risk of combustion product
spillage
•Enhanced efficiency by using outdoor air for combustion
Installation Considerations
When installing direct vent systems:
•Follow manufacturer's instructions precisely
•Use only approved venting components
•Maintain proper clearances at termination
•Ensure proper slope for condensate drainage
•Seal all joints according to manufacturer's requirements
•Consider wind and snow effects on termination location

Power Venting Systems
External Power Venters
Installed at the termination point of the
vent system, these devices create
mechanical draft to overcome resistance
in the vent system. They allow for longer
vent runs and can enable sidewall venting
for appliances that would otherwise
require vertical venting.
Induced Draft Blowers
Integrated into the appliance, these fans
are located between the heat exchanger
and the vent connection. They pull
combustion products through the heat
exchanger and push them into the vent
system, creating positive pressure in the
vent.
Integrated Power Vent
Appliances
Many modern appliances come with built-
in power venting systems designed
specifically for the appliance. These
integrated systems are engineered to
provide optimal performance and safety.

Troubleshooting Venting Issues
Spillage at Draft Hood
Possible causes: blocked chimney, inadequate draft,
downdraft, negative building pressure, improper vent sizing,
or disconnected vent.
Solutions: Check for blockages, verify proper sizing, ensure
adequate air supply, check for competing exhaust systems.
Condensation in Vent
Possible causes: oversized vent, long horizontal runs,
uninsulated vents in cold spaces, low flue gas temperature.
Solutions: Properly size vent, insulate where needed,
minimize horizontal runs, consider liner for masonry chimney.
Corrosion of Vent Materials
Possible causes: condensation, improper materials for
application, mixing of different metals.
Solutions: Use appropriate materials for the appliance
category, ensure proper slope for drainage, address
condensation issues.
Noise in Venting System
Possible causes: improper sizing, excessive draft, loose
connections, thermal expansion.
Solutions: Verify proper sizing, check connections, install
draft control if needed, ensure proper support.

Safety Considerations

The number of appliances to be vented affects the design and capacity of the
venting system.
New vs. Replacement Installation
Whether it is a new installation or a replacement appliance impacts venting
decisions.
Appliance Differences
Whether the replacement appliance is a different category or operates on a
different fuel or input rate than the original.

Understanding Downdraft
What is a Downdraft?
A condition in which a draft is
forced downward and can cause
flue gas spillage.
Causes of Downdraft
Can be caused by wind conditions,
improper vent termination, or
pressure differentials within the
building.
Dangers of Downdraft
Downdrafts can lead to dangerous
spillage of combustion products
into living spaces.

Natural Draft Explained
Heat Generation
Combustion creates hot gases in the appliance
Temperature Difference
Hot gases are less dense than surrounding air
Upward Movement
Hot gases rise through the vent system
Negative Pressure
Creates a negative pressure that draws in combustion air
Natural draft is produced by the upward movement of hot gases creating a
negative pressure.

Theoretical Draft Calculation
The formula for calculating theoretical draft involves the height of the vent (H), the stack temperature (T_s), and the outdoor air
temperature (T_o).
Height Factor
Taller vents produce stronger draft.
Temperature Differential
Greater difference between stack
and outdoor temperatures increases
draft.
Optimal Conditions
Highest stack temperature, lowest
outdoor air temperature, and highest
vent produce the greatest draft.

Stack Temperature Considerations
Average Stack Temperature
The average stack temperature is the average between the
temperature at the flue collar and the temperature at the
vent termination.
This is an important factor in calculating draft and ensuring
proper venting system operation.
Factors Affecting Stack Temperature
•Appliance efficiency
•Vent material and insulation
•Length of vent system
•Ambient temperature
•Appliance firing rate

Heat Extraction from Flue
Gases
Heat Reclaimer
A device installed to extract
heat from flue gases,
improving overall system
efficiency.
Heat Exchanger
Transfers heat from flue gases
to another medium without
mixing the two.
Heat Recovery Unit
A system designed to capture and utilize waste heat from flue gases.
These devices help improve energy efficiency by capturing heat that
would otherwise be lost through the venting system.

Vent System Capacity
Maximum Capacity
Each vent system has a maximum capacity related to flow.
Exceeding this capacity can lead to improper venting and
potentially dangerous conditions.
Minimum Capacity
Each vent system also has a minimum capacity related to
temperature. If the system operates below this capacity,
condensation and other issues may occur.
Understanding both the maximum and minimum capacities of a venting system is crucial for proper installation and safe
operation.

Vent Height Limitations
Limited Benefits
There is a limit to the benefits gained by increasing the vent height.
Diminishing Returns
After a certain point, adding height provides minimal additional draft
improvement.
Structural Considerations
Excessively tall vents may require additional structural support and can
be subject to greater wind forces.
Cost Factors
Taller vents increase installation costs without proportional
performance benefits beyond certain heights.

Building Considerations for Venting
Building Type Impact
The type of building significantly
affects venting system design and
installation. In many buildings, the
route of the venting system is
predetermined and factored into the
design.
Multi-Story Buildings
In buildings of more than one-storey,
a pipe chase is often built in and
centrally located to carry venting and
other piping from the ground floor or
basement to the roof.
Concealed Venting
In situations that require the vent
piping to be installed, the area is
framed in and the venting concealed.
In the case of a BW vent, it is installed
in the wall cavity and concealed.

Special Venting Systems
Certified Systems
Most vents and
components that the gas
technician/fitter is likely to
install are special venting
systems that use one of the
many types of BH vent
materials.
Installation
Instructions
Instructions for installing
these systems are found in
the appliance
manufacturer's and the
vent manufacturer's
certified installation
instructions.
Varied Requirements
These instructions are as varied as the manufacturers' products
and require the installer to carefully read and comply with the
requirements given.

Focus on Natural Draft Systems
Main Focus
Although this chapter covers BH vents
and some common aspects of their
installation, its main focus is on
natural draft vent systems.
Critical Decisions
Natural draft system installation
requires the gas technician/fitter to
make crucial decisions based on an
understanding of the venting system
and the numerous code requirements
applicable to natural draft venting
systems.
Other Venting Awareness
The gas technician/fitter must be
aware of the conditions pertaining to
the installation of other vents and
venting situations.

Installation Considerations
Clearances from Combustibles
Whatever route or type of venting you use, you must consider conditions such as
clearances from combustibles.
Firestop Requirements
Proper firestops must be installed where vents pass through floors, ceilings, or
walls.
Support Requirements
Adequate support must be provided for the venting system to maintain integrity
and proper clearances.
Termination Location
The location and height of vent and chimney terminations can impair venting
effectiveness if not properly installed.

Clearance Requirements
When installing vents and/or vent connectors, clearances from combustibles must always conform to the distances and clearance reductions itemized in CSA B149.1, Tables 8.6 and 8.7.

Types of Vents
Single-wall vent (Type C)
Simple vent type made of
galvanized steel.
Certified gas vents (Type
B)
Includes L-vent and BW types
with double-wall construction.
Factory-built chimneys
(Type A)
Designed for higher temperature
applications.
Canopies
Used in commercial applications for certain
appliances.
Special venting systems (Type BH vents)
Used for specific appliance categories with unique
requirements.

Single-Wall Vent (Type C)
Characteristics
Available in various lengths, gauges, and diameters, the
single-wall vent (Type C vent) is the simplest to install. It can
be cut to suit the measurements required, and the ends can
be field crimped with a crimping tool.
Single-wall vents are made of a single wall of galvanized
steel. Three screws, positioned 120° apart, secure sections
at each joint.
Available Fittings
•Tees
•Wyes
•Reducers
•Adjustable elbows
Limitations
Not being insulated, single-wall vents may not penetrate
floors, ceilings, or concealed areas of the building structure.

Wall Penetration
Requirements
Thimble Requirement
A single-wall vent may
penetrate a wall, provided the
wall is protected by a
ventilated metal thimble that
is two inches larger than the
vent or vent connector.
Code Compliance
This requirement is specified
in Clause 8.18.12 in CSA B149.1.
Purpose
The thimble provides protection for combustible wall materials from
the heat of the vent pipe.

Vent Connector Gauge Requirements

The minimum galvanized steel gauges vary with the diameters of the vent connectors, as specified
in Clause 8.18.3 of CSA B149.1.

Type B Vent Characteristics
Certification
Certified to CAN/ULC-S605,
Standard for Gas Vents or an
equivalent standard.
Factory-Made Parts
Made up of factory-made parts,
each designed to be assembled
without the need for field
fabrication.
Appliance Compatibility
Used with appliances certified
for use with Type B vents.
Construction
A double-wall vent with a dead air space (insulating
space) between the walls.
No Field Cutting
Not designed to be field cut.

Type B Vent Components
Available Lengths
B vents are available in pre-cut lengths from 6 to 60 inches,
depending on the diameter.
B vents have open-end sleeves available for length
adjustment.
Available Fittings
•Tees
•Wyes
•Adjustable 90° and 45° elbows
•Single-wall vent adapters
B-vent pipe and fittings are connected with a twist lock
procedure.
Note that a base fitting for a Type B vent must be accessible for inspection.

Type B Vent Construction
Materials
B-vents are constructed of non-combustible, corrosion-resistant material.
Inner Wall
They have an aluminum inner wall that can withstand vent gas temperatures to a
maximum of 470°F (243°C).
Usage Restrictions
As specified in Clause 8.10.7 of CSA B149.1, you may only use Type B vents to
vent gas appliances with draft-hoods or diverters.
Additional Allowance
You may also use them for appliances without draft control devices, provided
that the appliance has certification for use with a Type B vent.

Category I Appliances
Certification
The conditions for using Type B vents
are also satisfied if the appliance has
been certified and marked Category I.
Sizing Importance
Since the insulating quality of a Type B
vent is less than that of a factory-built
insulated metal chimney, sizing B-
vents is a must to avoid excess
temperatures when installed in wood
frame construction.
Clearance Requirements
The minimum clearance from
combustibles is designated in Table

## 8.6 of CSA B149.1.


Outdoor Vent Installation
1
Certification Requirement
When a double-wall vent cannot be practically installed inside a building, it
may be installed outdoors if it is certified for outdoor installation.
2
Installation Instructions
It must be installed in accordance with the manufacturer's certified
installation instructions.
3
Continuity Requirement
The double-wall vent must be continuous from the vent cap to the appliance
draft-hood or flue collar outlet.
4
Enclosure Requirement
The outdoor vent below the roof line must be enclosed and may be required,
under the manufacturer's certification, to have the enclosure insulated.

Type BW Vent
Construction
Type BW vents are similar in
construction to Type B vents, but are
oval in cross-section. They are
designed specifically for installation in
walls for venting recessed wall
furnaces.
Certification
Type BW vents must be certified
under the CAN/ULC-S605, Standard
for Gas Vents, or equivalent
standards, and requirements apply to
all components of the venting system.
Assembly
They consist entirely of factory-made
parts, each designed to be assembled
without the need for field fabrication.
The vent is connected with a snap-
lock procedure.
Since the development of side-wall vented appliances, Type BW vents are no longer commonly used.

Type L Vent
Higher Grade
Type L vents are often described as a higher grade double wall vent compared to Type
B vent.
Temperature Rating
Type L vent can withstand a higher flue gas temperature than Type B vent. Maximum
vent gas temperature is 550°F (288°C).
Applications
They are used with appliances certified for use with Type L vents (usually oil-fired
appliances), as well as in place of Type B vents.
Certification
Type L vents are certified under ULC Standard S609, Low temperature vents, Type L;
the requirements of this Standard apply to all components of the venting system.

Canopy Venting
Application
As specified in Clause 8.30 of CSA B149.1, you may vent an
appliance through an exhaust canopy installed in other
than a dwelling unit if specific conditions are met.
Code Compliance
The canopy must comply with the requirements of the
applicable codes, including CSA B149.1, the NBC, and the
National Fire Code of Canada.
Exhaust Volume
The exhaust volume of the canopy must be sufficient to
provide for capture and removal of grease-laden vapours
and products of combustion.
Appliance Requirements
The appliance must have an input not exceeding 400
MBtu/h (120 kw) and its flue outlet must be directly under
the canopy.

Canopy Interlock Requirements
Interlock Requirement
The appliance must be interlocked with the exhaust so that
it can operate only when exhaust air flow is proven.
This ensures that combustion products are properly
removed and don't accumulate in the space.
Exceptions to Interlock Requirement
•A booster water heater with an input of 50 MBtu/h (15
kw) or less that supplies water to an automatic
dishwasher
•An appliance approved to ANSI Z83.11/CSA 1.8
Most cooking appliances that would normally be installed
under a canopy are approved to ANSI Z83.11/CSA 1.8 and,
therefore, would not normally be interlocked with the
exhaust fan.

Special Venting Systems Defined
Type BH Vent
A vent complying with ULC S636 and
consisting entirely of factory-made
parts, each designed to be assembled
with the others without requiring field
fabrication, and intended for venting
gas appliances.
Special Venting System
A venting system certified with the
appliance and either supplied or
specified by the appliance
manufacturer.
Application
Gas technicians/fitters must employ
Type BH vent or special venting
systems on all Category II, III and IV
appliances.

BH Vent Certification
Interchangeable Terms
Although "Type BH Vent" and
"special venting system" are
commonly used
interchangeably, some
metallic types of special
venting systems may have
approval for use with only the
specific appliance.
ULC S636 Certification
All BH vents - both metallic
and non-metallic - are
certified to ULC S636 and are
considered special venting
systems.
Code Requirement
Since January 2007, Clause 8.9.6 of CSA B149.1 requires that vents
constructed of plastic piping shall be certified to ULC S636.

BH Venting System Materials
Stainless Steel
Used for higher temperature applications.
PVC
Used for lower temperature applications.
CPVC
Used for medium temperature applications.
Polypropylene

Special Venting System Installation
Manufacturer Specifications
The manufacturers of the appliance and vent system largely determine the size,
location, installation methods, and type of material employed in special venting
systems.
Varied Procedures
Manufacturers use different vent materials and have different installation
procedures.
Consultation Requirement
Consult all applicable codes and certified manufacturer's instructions for safe and
efficient installation of these types of venting systems.
Brand Compatibility
It is imperative that the appliance manufacturer lists a given brand of BH venting as
acceptable on a specific appliance.

BH Vent Component Compatibility
No Mixing of Components
Different BH vent manufacturers have different joint systems and adhesives. Do not mix pipe,
fittings or joining methods from different manufacturers.
Multiple Venting Options
Some gas appliances may have approval for venting with more than one class of BH vent, as
well as concentric or two pipe direct vent options.
Starter Adapters
Typically the appliance manufacturer supplies the starter adapter to ensure proper connection
between the appliance and the venting system.
Detailed Instructions
With all of these venting options, manufacturers' vent installation instructions have become
more detailed than the general installation instructions to the point that they are often a
separate manual.

S636 Plastic Vent Systems
Historical Development
Plastic venting products have facilitated sidewall vented gas
installations for many years. However, over the years, the
industry has used certain plastic products in gas venting
with varying degrees of success.
The need to produce a plastic venting standard against
which the industry could test products became evident amid
findings that ABS and PVC plastic fracture and distort with
heat exposure over time. The result was the development
and acceptance of ULC S636.
Applications
Type BH plastic vents usually work with high-efficiency
appliances that produce low flue temperatures and positive
vent pressures (Category IV).
The low flue temperatures create abundant water vapour,
and thus manufacturers must make the venting system out
of corrosion-resistant and leak proof material.
In some cases, Type BH plastic vent work with appliances
that introduce a high proportion of dilution air to cool the
flue gases before entering the plastic vent.

Plastic Vent Installation
Considerations
Manufacturer's Instructions
The appliance manufacturer's instructions provide information on required sizing,
allowable lengths, and allowable number of fittings since this information depends on
the appliance features.
Fire-Rated Penetrations
If the plastic BH vent must penetrate a fire-rated wall or ceiling, be sure to use an
approved listed penetration assembly.
Air Supply Piping
The requirement for vents that use plastic piping to be certified to ULC S636 applies
only to the vent pipe. The appliance manufacturer's instructions usually specify the air
supply pipe material.
Compliance Requirements
Check with the manufacturer and comply with all applicable requirements concerning
sizing, joining, and supporting the plastic air supply piping.

PVC Vent Systems

up to and including 65°C (149°F)
•White in colour
636 CPVC
•Classified as Type BH Class II B vent
•Suitable for use on appliances with flue gas temperatures
up to and including 90°C
•Grey in colour
There are two types of PVC venting systems that are certified to ULC S636.

PVC Vent Joining Materials
Specialized Cement
Each manufacturer of S636 PVC vent has solvent cement that is specifically formulated
and certified for flue gas venting applications.
Transition Cement
Transitioning between venting materials and connection to ABS appliance connectors
require the use of specialized transition cement.
Primer Requirements
Primer may be a requirement for applications where the gas venting system is to be
installed in cold temperatures. It is always a requirement for 6 inch and 8 inch piping
systems and for all installations performed at temperatures of 0°C or less.
Local Regulations
Some jurisdictions have mandated primer use regardless of temperature (e.g., Alberta).
Check with your local authorities.

PVC Vent Installation Process
Preparation
Obtain proper materials for
job (proper cement and
applicator for the size of
piping system to be
assembled). Cut pipe as
square as possible using a
hand saw and mitre box or
mechanical saw. Remove all
burrs from both the inside and
outside of the pipe with a de-
burring tool.
Dry Fit and Priming
Check pipe and fittings for dry
fit before cementing. For
proper interference fit, the
pipe must go easily into the
fitting 1/3 to 2/3 of the way.
Apply primer to both the
fitting socket and the pipe
end, aggressively working the
surfaces until softened.
Cement Application
and Assembly
Apply cement to both
surfaces, first to the pipe end
and then to the fitting socket.
Immediately assemble while
cement is still wet, using
sufficient force to ensure the
pipe bottoms in the fitting
socket. Twist the pipe a
quarter turn during insertion.
Finishing and Curing
Hold the joint for
approximately 30 seconds to
avoid push out. Remove
excess cement with a rag.
Allow proper set and cure
time according to
manufacturer's instructions
before testing or using the
system.

Notes:
1. Initial set schedule is the necessary time to allow before the joint can be carefully handled.
2. Joint cure schedule is the necessary time to allow before commissioning the system.
3. In damp or humid weather allow 50% more cure time.

Polypropylene Venting Systems
Classification
S636 Class IIC vent systems are made of polypropylene
material suitable for use on appliances with flue gas
temperatures up to and including 230°F (110°C).
Available Types
•Single wall
•Flex
•Concentric
Black UV resistant pipe is also available where terminations
are exposed to sunlight.
Polypropylene venting systems offer several advantages including higher temperature ratings than PVC and simpler
installation without cement.

Polypropylene Vent Installation
Connection Method
Push-fit connections joined
pipes, with EPDM or Viton
gaskets located in the sockets.
Installation Direction
Install pipes and components
with their socket ends to the
outlet and male ends to the
appliance.
Slope Requirement
Elbows are 87° to give horizontal
runs at least 3° slope for proper
condensate drainage back to the
appliance condensate trap.
Manufacturer Compatibility
Do not mix different manufacturers' products.
Support Requirements
Support vents 1 m horizontal, 2 m vertical, and at
changes in direction.

Polypropylene Vent Cutting and Joining
Cutting Guidelines
•Select components to minimize cutting
•Where cutting is necessary, you can cut pipe sections to
length at male end (non-socketed end)
•Make any cuts at right angles to the pipe
•You can bevel pipe for insertion into the adjoining socket
to ease installation
•Deburr all field cuts
•Never cut bends and other pre-formed components
Joining Process
•Check that gasket is properly in place
•Mark insertion depth
•Lubricate seals and male parts of pipes as per
manufacturer; use lubricant, soapy water, or water only
•Slip a locking band onto the male end of pipe
•Push male end of pipe into opening with light twisting
movement

Polypropylene Flex Venting
Manufacturer Variations
For polypropylene flex venting material, some manufacturers have
intermittent straight section for cutting and connecting.
Gasket Placement
Others use a gasket that places into first whole groove nearest the end.
Connection Method
The end is then inserted into an adapter with locking tabs.
Application
Flex venting is particularly useful for installations with offsets or where rigid
pipe would be difficult to install.

S636 Metal Vent Systems
Applications
Numerous gas-fired appliances such as boilers and water
heaters have certification for use with stainless steel venting
products certified to ULC S636.
Usually, gas technicians/fitters use this type of venting on
appliances with a positive vent pressure of less than 8 inches
w.c. (1990 Pa) that may have flue gas temperatures
exceeding those allowed for certified plastic vents.
Construction
Most Type BH metal vents utilize AL 29-4C® stainless steel
of either single- or double-wall construction.
Sizes vary from 3 to 24 inches (7.5 to 600 mm) in diameter
and are available in a multitude of lengths -- usually up to 10
feet (3 m) for rigid pipe and 20 feet (6 m) for flexible pipe.
Specialty certified components such as elbows, wall
thimbles, termination tees, and drain traps complete the
installation needs of most side-wall or vertical venting
choices.

Metal BH Vent Joining
Gasket Verification
The female end of each
stainless steel component
incorporates a silicone
sealing gasket. Gaskets must
be in the proper position or
flue gases could leak
resulting in carbon
monoxide poisoning.
Pipe Alignment and
Connection
Align pipes and push them
together as far as they will go
to indent or at least 1.75
inches.
Clamp Tightening
Tighten gear clamp to a
minimum torque of 40 in/lb
and a maximum of 50 in/lb.
Gear clamp is not required
on a 6 inch system.
Proper Orientation
Proper pipe orientation is
essential to achieve effective
condensate flow. In most
cases, the use of a flue collar
adaptor is required to
connect directly to the
appliance. This adaptor will
configure the vent
orientation with the gasket
end of pipe and fittings
towards termination.
Note: Some flue collars may require the use of high temperature silicone sealant to make a positive pressure gas-tight seal.

Drainage Requirements for BH Metal Vents
Drainage Fitting Requirement
A drainage fitting is commonly required on the lowest section of
BH metal vent.
Purpose
This fitting allows condensate that forms in the vent to be
properly drained away.
Installation Location
The drainage fitting should be installed at the lowest point in the
venting system.
Condensate Disposal
Condensate must be properly disposed of according to local
codes, typically through a neutralizer before entering the
drainage system.

Existing Unapproved Special
Venting Systems
High Temperature Plastic Venting (HTPV)
Was approved at one time. However, users experienced significant field failures with
its use, causing many jurisdictions to issue regulations and bulletins outlining
additional requirements affecting HTPV systems.
ABS Pipe and Fittings
Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene pipe and fittings were commonly used before 2007.
Non-Certified PVC and CPVC
PVC and CPVC pipe and fittings not certified to ULC S636 were also common before
2007.
Local Regulations
The gas technician/fitter is responsible for becoming familiar with all applicable local
regulations and bulletins regarding these systems.

Regulations for Non-Certified Plastic Vents
Non-Retroactive Requirement
Although the requirement to use plastic vents certified to
ULC S636 has been in place since January 2007, it was not a
retroactive requirement.
This means that existing installations with non-certified
vents were generally allowed to remain in service.
Local Authority Direction
Local authorities having jurisdiction may have special
advisories or bulletins related to the use, inspection, or
repair of non-certified plastic vents.
Check with the local authority for direction on this issue.
Some manufacturers of high efficiency appliances are
approved for common venting. In such cases, you would be
allowed to use an existing common vent system.

Chimneys and Liners
Code Requirements
The Gas Codes, the NBC, and local Building Codes detail special requirements for
masonry and metal chimneys because chimneys must be constructed to meet Building
Code requirements for fire safety and structural integrity.
New Chimney Requirements
For new chimneys, the builder must meet these requirements under the applicable
Building Code.
Installer Responsibilities
The installer (the gas technician/fitter) for both new and existing chimneys is
responsible for examination of the chimney to ensure that it is properly lined and free of
soot, creosote, or obstructions prior to connection.
Preparation Requirements
Cleaning and repair of the chimney (if required) must therefore precede connection.

Chimney Cleanouts
Purpose
All chimneys require a cleanout opening, which is an
opening into the chimney to allow clearing of any built up
debris.
The cleanout is also used as an inspection point to assess
the condition of the chimney and its freedom from debris or
other buildup. Placing a mirror strategically in the cleanout
enables inspection.
Location
The location of the cleanout should be as far below the vent
connector as possible to lower the risk of debris blockage in
the vent connector.
Before connecting a vent connector to the chimney, cement
a sleeve first in place to facilitate removal of the vent
connector for inspection and cleaning.
It is important that the vent connector does not protrude
into the chimney since it might touch the opposite wall of
the chimney, blocking off the vent and interrupting the
venting process.

Chimney Use Restrictions
Solid-Fuel Appliance
Restriction
Where a chimney flue in a dwelling unit
serves a solid-fuelled appliance or active
fireplace (where the opening from the
fireplace to the flue is not permanently
sealed), never use it to vent a gas
burning appliance.
Reason for Restriction
This requirement is based on the risk of
soot and creosote buildup in chimney
flues serving solid-fuelled appliances,
which may adversely affect venting and
pose a potential fire hazard.
Alternative Options
In these cases, a separate venting
system must be used for the gas
appliance, or the solid-fuel appliance
must be permanently decommissioned.

Factory-Built, Insulated Metal Chimneys
Purpose and Applications
Factory-built chimneys, or Type A vents, help vent oil or
solid-fuel appliances, or gas appliances that have flue
temperatures that exceed 470°F (243°C).
Because of the high temperatures, these vents are made of
such heat-resistant materials as masonry (brick) or
insulated steel. They often comprise two walls of stainless
steel filled with insulating mineral fibre.
Construction and Assembly
An insulated metal chimney is not designed to be field cut.
Lengths available range from 8 to 36 inches, depending on
the diameters required by the venting system.
The fittings include tees with 15°, 30°, and 45° elbows. Note
that 90° elbows are not available.
Accessories include wall, roof, and floor supports, adjustable
offset supports, anchor plates, roof flashings, storm collars,
and termination caps. Manufacturers use a twist-lock
procedure to assemble an insulated metal chimney.

Chimney Liners
Purpose
Chimneys may require modification
with a chimney liner that both reduces
the inside diameter and restricts
condensation.
Liners are usually ceramic or metal.
Ceramic Liners
The ceramic liner used in brick or
masonry chimneys must be installed
when the bricklayer is building the
chimney.
Metal Liners
Manufacturers can make metal liners
from rigid or flexible metals to suit
specific venting applications.
These are often used to retrofit
existing masonry chimneys for use
with gas appliances.

Metal Chimney Liner Installation
Chimney Preparation
Thoroughly clean the
chimney and check it for
cracked, loose, or missing
bricks, mortar, or other
materials that could inhibit
the correct installation of the
lining system.
Liner Installation
Extend the liner to its
maximum length before
installation. Feed liner down
from top of chimney,
allowing approximately 12
inches to extend through
basement wall and 6 to 12
inches to extend above the
top of the chimney.
Top Termination
Center the liner at the top of
the chimney using non-
combustible material.
Secure with cement mixture
or flashing. Trim the liner to
the required height and
secure rain cap with three
evenly spaced screws.
Bottom Connection
At the chimney inlet, place
the mortar guard around
liner and mortar it in place.
Trim the liner at the chimney
base, leaving a maximum of
2 inches extending beyond
mortar guard and attach to
the appliance.

Vent and Chimney Terminations
Wind Effects
Termination of vents or chimneys in areas where they would be susceptible to
the effects of wind pressures can impair the effectiveness of vents.
Code Requirements
For this reason, CSA B149.1 prescribes the location of vent and chimney
terminations and the minimum height and clearances for vent and chimney
outlets.
Location Importance
Proper location ensures effective venting and prevents hazardous conditions
from developing.
Clearance Requirements
Specific clearances from roof surfaces, walls, and other building features must
be maintained.

Venting System
Components
Figure 3-1 shows different types of venting systems and the terminology
applied to individual components. This diagram illustrates the various
parts of a venting system including the chimney, vent, vent connector,
and how they relate to different types of appliances.

General Venting
Requirements
The vent tables included in this Annex apply to vents and chimneys
internal to the structure below the roof line. Exterior chimneys or
vents not enclosed by the structure or a chase below the roof line can
experience continuous condensation, depending on locality. A
chimney with one or more sides exposed to the outside of the
structure shall be considered to be an exterior chimney. A Type B vent
or a certified chimney lining system passing through an unused
masonry chimney flue shall not be considered to the outdoors. The
DP column shall be used to determine the capacity of a venting
system within a building constructed in accordance with Clause 8.2.1.

Internal Vent and Chimney Definition
Figure 3-2 illustrates the definition of internal vents and
chimneys according to the code requirements.
These diagrams show how venting systems are classified
based on their location within or outside the building
structure.

Vent Size Reduction Requirements
1
Vent Connector Size
Vents or vent connectors for appliance draft-hood
outlets or flue collars 12 in (305 mm) or less in
diameter are not reduced more than one table size
[e.g., 4 in (102 mm) to 3 in (76 mm) is a one-size
reduction]
2
Larger Vent Connectors
Vents or vent connectors for appliance draft-hood
outlets or flue collars above 12 in (305 mm) in diameter
are not reduced more than two table sizes [e.g., 24 in
(610 mm) to 20 in (508 mm) is a two-size reduction]
3
Fan-Assisted Appliance Capacity
The maximum capacity listed in the tables for a fan-
assisted appliance is reduced by 10% (calculated as

## 0.90 × maximum capacity)

4
Draft-Hood Outlet Size
The draft-hood outlet is greater than 4 in (102 mm) in
diameter. For example, a 3 in (76 mm) diameter vent
or vent connector shall not be connected to a 4 in (102
mm) diameter draft-hood outlet. This provision shall
not apply to fan-assisted appliances.

Use of Smaller Vents and
Vent Connectors
Figure 3-3 illustrates the proper use of smaller vents and vent
connectors. The diagram shows how vent sizes relate to draft hood
outlets and the appropriate sizing requirements that must be followed
for safe and effective venting.

Impact of Elbows on Vent
Capacity
Figure 3-4 demonstrates how elbows reduce vent capacity. When lateral
length is greater than zero, 2 elbows are assumed in Tables 1 and 2. The
diagram illustrates how the configuration of elbows in a venting system
affects the overall capacity and performance.

Combined Vent Connectors
If vent connectors are combined prior to entering the vertical common vent, the maximum common vent capacity listed in
the common venting tables shall be reduced by 10%, the equivalent of one 90° elbow (0.90 × maximum common vent
capacity). The horizontal length of the common vent connector manifold (L in Figure C.9) should not exceed 1-1/2 ft (457
mm) for each inch (25.4 mm) of common vent connector manifold diameter.

Offset Common Vents
If the common vertical vent is offset as shown in Figure C.10, the
maximum common vent capacity listed in the common venting tables
should be reduced by 20%, the equivalent of two 90° elbows (0.80 ×
maximum common vent capacity). The horizontal length of the offset
shall not exceed 1-1/2 ft (457 mm) for each inch (25.4 mm) of
common vent diameter.

High-Altitude Installation
Considerations
Use sea-level input rating when determining maximum capacity for
high-altitude installation. Use actual derated input for determining
minimum capacity for high-altitude installation. The actual high
altitude input will have less heat, hence the reason for checking the
minimum vent capacity. This lower heat input will take up the same
amount of volume as the sea level rating. For this reason, it is
necessary to also check the maximum capacity using the higher sea
level rating.

Modulating Input Rate
Appliances
For appliances with modulating input rates, the minimum vent or vent
connector (FAN Min) capacity (determined from the tables) shall be
less than the lowest appliance input rating, and the maximum vent or
vent connector (FAN or NAT Max) capacity (determined from the
tables) shall be greater than the highest appliance input rating.

Fan-Assisted Furnace
Common Venting
A fan-assisted furnace may be common-vented into an existing
masonry chimney, provided that...
The image shows the requirements for common-venting a fan-assisted
furnace into an existing masonry chimney, including specific conditions
that must be met for safe operation.

Single-Appliance Venting
Restrictions
Single-appliance venting of a fan-assisted furnace into a tile-lined
masonry chimney shall be prohibited. The chimney shall first be lined
with either a Type B vent, sized in accordance with Table C.1 or C.2, or
a certified lining system.
The intent of this general requirement is to prevent excessive
condensation and poor venting performance when a single fan-assisted
appliance is vented into a masonry chimney. To maintain a dry, warm
vent, use a properly sized Type B vent or certified lining system.

Corrugated Metallic
Chimney Liner Systems
Certified, corrugated metallic chimney liner systems in masonry
chimneys shall be sized according to Table C.1 or C.2 for dedicated
venting and Table C.3 or C.4 for common venting, with the maximum
capacity reduced by 20% (0.80 × maximum capacity) and the
minimum capacity as shown in the applicable table. Corrugated metal
vent systems installed with bends or offsets require additional
reduction of the vent maximum capacity (see Clause C.2.6).

Chimney Liner System Sizing
Size both vent connectors and chimney in accordance with Tables C.7 and C.8.
These diagrams illustrate the proper sizing requirements for chimney liner
systems and how they should be installed in masonry chimneys.

Interpolation in Vent Sizing
Tables
Interpolation is finding the capacity between table values graphically or
mathematically. What if L is 7 ft?
H(ft)L(ft)Btu/h x 1000

Graphical Interpolation
Solution
The graphical solution shows how to visually determine values between
table entries by plotting the known values and drawing a line to find the
interpolated value.
The mathematical solution provides a formula for calculating the
interpolated value directly from the table values.

Manufacturer's Literature
Importance
Installers of venting systems should carefully adhere to the
manufacturers' certified instructions for the appliance and venting
system, as well as Code requirements and design plans.
Following manufacturer's instructions is critical for proper installation
and safe operation of venting systems. These instructions are specifically
designed for each appliance and provide important details that may not
be covered in general code requirements.

House-as-a-System
Approach
Building Codes require that the system of air supply to people and
equipment that traditionally occurred through leaks in the building
envelope is now provided mechanically.
By taking a house-as-a-system approach, researchers were able to
recognize that eliminating one form of air supply (air leakage) called for
compensation with another form of air supply (mechanical ventilation).
Failing to account for such factors can severely disrupt the house-as-a-
system balance.

House Depressurization
Concerns
Although there are many other examples of such interaction, the main
focus for the gas appliance installer is on maintaining a balance between
air pressures and air flows. With the increased number of "tight" new and
renovated houses and major air exhausting appliances (clothes dryers,
central vacuums, and range hoods), the chance of exceeding the House
Depressurization Limit (HDL) of 5 Pa is greatly increased. This means
that you must check the house pressures so as to accurately gauge the
state of the house as a system.
Installers must be certain whether installation of a fan-assisted or
natural-draft appliance in a house can be safe.

Vent Sizing Table Prerequisites
Building Depressurization
The building in which you are to install the appliances
must not develop depressurization greater than 0.02
inch w.c. (5 Pa). This is known as the House
Depressurization Limit (HDL). If house pressures
cannot be reliably controlled within the HDL, you
should never install fan-assisted and draft hood
appliances. Vent sizing tables would thus not apply.
Venting System Layout
The layout of the venting system must fall within the
limits of the vent sizing tables in terms of vent height,
length of laterals, vent connector rise, and vent sizes. If
any aspect of the venting system exceeds these
limitations the venting tables should not be used, as
the system must be engineered according to
approved practices.

Fan-Assisted Combustion System
A fan more precisely regulates combustion air supply. Unlike forced or induced draft equipment, the fan does not develop any
venting pressure, but delivers air at a rate that results in complete combustion without as much excess air as a natural draft
appliance.
Venting is still dependent on buoyancy, and a type of draft pressure neutralization device is generally used upstream of the
burner. From this point on, buoyancy forces vent flue gases.
A flow switch is incorporated, proving that the burner fan is operating.

Venting and Draft Characteristics
Figure 3-12 shows typical venting and draft characteristics for both natural draft and fan-assisted gas appliances. The diagram
illustrates the different pressure profiles and flow patterns that occur in these two types of venting systems.

Common Venting System
Configurations
In Figure 3-13(a), flue gases from the fan-assisted appliance can settle in
the common vent, holding back flue gases from the fan-assisted
appliance. In some cases, the path of least resistance for the flue gases
leads through the draft hood of the water heater, causing spillage into
the building.
Figures 3-13(b) and 3-13(c) are generally recognized as "better practice"
alternatives to the system shown in Figure 3-13(a).

Improved Common Venting
Configurations
Y-Fitting Configuration
In Figure 3-13(b), a "Y" fitting for the water heater downstream of the
fan-assisted appliance improves the venting of the water heater and
may reduce the potential for spillage.
Elevated Connection
In Figure 3-13(c), the connection of the water heater is above the
connection of the fan-assisted appliance. When the fan-assisted
appliance is operating alone, its flue gases warm the air in the
common vent below the water connection. As venting is established,
the flue gases rise vertically by passing the water connection. In
properly designed and installed venting systems, this configuration
was found to be most effective in minimizing spillage.

Appliance Venting Design
Considerations
1
Installation Type
Note that different
considerations apply to a
new appliance group
installation versus
replacement of one or more
existing appliances.
2
Appliance Type
Consider different
requirements and parts of
the tables apply to fan-
assisted versus natural
draft appliances.
3
Layout Complexity
Make adjustments to capacities listed in the tables to account for
additional fittings beyond those originally used in developing the
current version of the vent sizing tables, depending on the
simplicity or complexity of the layout.

Common Venting Chart
This chart provides guidance for common venting of two or more appliances. It helps determine the appropriate sizing and
configuration based on the types of appliances being vented together.

Multi-Storey Venting
Systems
Multi-storey venting systems require special consideration for both new
installations and replacement of appliances in existing systems. The
diagram shows how these systems are configured across multiple floors
of a building.

New Multi-Storey Venting Systems
Professional Design
Obtain the design from a design professional or the venting
system manufacturer.
Pre-Installation Review
Review the design with the local inspection authority and/or
utility before installation to avoid costly surprises.
Proper Installation
Install the system according to the design drawing and
specifications. Seek prior approval for substitution of certified
components. Where the system has been engineered, the
designer must review the installation before it is closed in.
Inspection Coordination
Arrange and coordinate inspections according to the work plan
and avoid delays.

Replacing Appliances in Multi-Storey Systems
It is more common to have to replace appliances connected to a multi-storey venting system (Figure 3-16). The gas technician/fitter should note the following key points:
Compatible Replacement
The replacement appliance(s) should be of the same size
(output capacity) and venting type (fan-assisted versus
natural draft) as the original appliance(s). The replacements
should be compatible with the multi-storey venting system.
Avoid Significant Changes
Do not make significant changes to the venting system or
add additional appliance inputs without first seeking
competent advice.
Performance Issues
If venting system performance problems are observed or
reported, do not proceed with any alteration to the system or
connect appliances without contacting the local inspection
authority or utility.

Sloped vs. Horizontal
Manifolds
Exceeding the minimum slope requirements for a manifold can cause
trouble. An example is draft hood spillage from the appliance most
distant from the vertical vent. The lack of adequate connector rise for
this situation is shown in Figure 3-17. It is preferable by far to use a
horizontal manifold than to slope it excessively.

Tapered vs. Constant-Size Manifolds
You can taper manifolds for the actual input to the particular section, or they can be of constant diameter using the selected
common vent size. There is no significant difference in the operating characteristics of these two options (Figure 3-18).

Manifold Design Types
TypeDescription
Tapered· For each section of the tapered
manifold, increase the total combined
rated heat input by 11% (which is the
same as reducing table capacity to
90%). · You can find the total height for
that section based on the highest
connected appliance outlet. As you
pick up succeeding appliances, add
each input multiplied by 1.11 to find the
next size.
Constant-size· Add together the rated inputs of all
connected appliances, and multiply the
sum by 1.11. This final number is the
design input for a manifold of constant
size. · Total height is the basis of the
highest connected appliance outlet.

Chapter 4
Size venting systems for
Category I appliances
CSA B149.1 provides detailed vent sizing tables used for the correct sizing
of draft-hood-equipped and fan-assisted appliances. The tables are
informative, and CSA B149.1 states that a vented appliance must be
attached to a vent or chimney. The vent or chimney action must work to
remove the flue gases from the appliance to outdoors. The gas
technician/fitter must know how to use these tables, as well as the
requirements for specific types of appliances and venting configurations.

Objectives
Interpret vent sizing tables
Learn how to read and understand the various vent sizing tables in
CSA B149.1 for different appliance types and configurations.
Use vent sizing tables
Apply the tables correctly to size venting systems for Category I
appliances in various installation scenarios.

Key Facts About Vent Sizing
Vent Reduction
The vent for a fan assisted
appliance with a 4" flue
collar may be reduced to 3"
if determined by the tables.
Vent Connector
Elbows
A single vented fan-
assisted appliance requires
3 elbows for the vent
connector. The table
capacity needs to be
reduced by 15%.
Preferred Pipe Diameter
When the vent table permits more than one diameter of pipe that
can be used for a connector or the vent, the smaller connector or
vent is preferred.

Capacity Adjustments
Horizontal Common Vent
If the vent connectors are connected to a horizontal
common vent connector manifold, the common vent
capacity table must be reduced by 10%.
Offset Common Vent
If the common vent is offset, the common vent
capacity table must be reduced by 20%.

Interpreting Vent Sizing
Tables
This section provides an explanation of how to use the vent sizing tables
in Annex C of CSA B149.1 for Category I appliance installations.
Main Reasons for Tables
The vent sizing tables were developed to properly size vents
serving draft-hood-equipped and fan-assisted appliances
(Category I) and to account for the -0.02 inch w.c. (-5 Pa) house
depressurization limit.
Important Considerations
The tables are only intended for Category I appliances vented to a
Type B vent, a certified chimney liner, or as permitted, a tile-lined
chimney.

Using Vent Sizing Tables
Alternative Venting Methods
For all other methods of venting, follow the manufacturer's
certified installation instructions, or consult the local inspection
authority, propane distributor, or gas utility.
Table Limitations
Whenever the tables do not show a particular venting system
arrangement, this means that use of the tables is not permitted.
The venting system, if permitted by the authority having
jurisdiction, must be designed and approved.

Handling Non-Exact Table
Values
Interpolation
You can interpolate the table as described in GVR C.2.15 when the
actual installation values don't exactly match table values.
Worst Case Scenario
You can use the values in the table provided you select table values
that would provide inferior venting compared to the actual
installation. Selecting table values of lesser heights and rises and
longer laterals ensures the actual installation will operate at a greater
capacity than indicated by the tables.

Understanding Table C.1
Table C.1 shows the capacity of Type B double-wall vents with Type B double-wall vent connectors serving a single Category I
appliance.
Key Components
•Vent and vent connector diameter (D) in inches
•Lateral length (L) in feet
•Height (H) in feet
•Appliance input rating in thousands of Btu/h
Column Types
•FAN columns for fan-assisted appliances
•NAT columns for natural draft appliances
•Min/Max columns indicate allowable input ranges
•DP column for depressurization scenarios

Example A: Single Fan-Assisted Appliance
Identify Parameters
A fan-assisted furnace with an input rating of 120 MBtu/h
is being installed in a storage building. It has a height (H) of
10 ft, and a Type B lateral vent connector with a length (L)
of 5 ft.
Consult Table C.1
Find the row with a height of 10 ft. Within the next column,
find the row with a lateral length of 5 ft.
Find Appropriate Range
Proceed across to find the range of MIN and MAX under
the FAN column that contains 120 MBtu/h. The
appropriate range is 41 to 187 MBtu/h.
Determine Vent Size
Look up the column in which this range appears to obtain
the vent and vent connector diameter. A 5 inch diameter is
required.

Single Fan-Assisted Appliance
Connected to a Type B Vent
The safe and effective venting of fan-assisted appliances is one of the main
reasons for the current version of the vent sizing tables. Fan-assisted appliances
are more susceptible to condensation in the vent because they produce a lower
volume and temperature of flue gas than draft-hood-equipped appliances. Take
care to size their venting properly.
Table C.1
Use when you use a Type B vent connector
Table C.2
Use in situations in which a single wall vent connector is used

Single Draft-Hood-Equipped Appliance
Connected to a Type B Vent
You may also use Tables C.1 and C.2 to size a venting system serving a single draft-hood-equipped appliance. However,
instead of the FAN columns, use the NAT columns.
MAX Column
Applies to situations where an appliance is being installed in
a leaky building without air exhausting appliances or
equipment
DP Column
Should be used practically all of the time. The DP column
capacities were developed to account for the maximum

## 0.02 inch w.c. (5 Pa) negative pressure (depressurization).


Example B: Draft-Hood-Equipped Appliance
Identify Parameters
A 120 MBtu/h pool heater is
being installed in a shed. It
has a height of 10 ft, and a
single-wall lateral vent
connector with a length of 2
ft.
Consult Table C.2
Find the row with a height of
10 ft. Within the next
column, find the row with a
lateral length of 2 ft.
Find Appropriate
Capacity
Proceed across until you find
a MAX capacity greater than
or equal to 120 MBtu/h under
the NAT column. The MAX
column is used because the
shed is a leaky structure with
no air exhausting appliances.
Determine Vent Size
The appropriate capacity is
128 MBtu/h. Look up the
column in which this
capacity appears to obtain
the vent and vent connector
diameter. A 5 inch or larger
diameter is required.

Single Draft-Hood-Equipped
Appliance Connected to a Tile-
Lined Chimney
There are a number of cases where replacing an older appliance that is connected
to a tile-lined masonry chimney is necessary. In these situations, Tables C.5 and
C.6 may be used, provided these requirements are satisfied:
Chimney Condition
The chimney must be lined and
in good condition
Chimney Location
The chimney must be warm - it
cannot be located on an
exterior wall
Liner Size
The chimney liner must not be oversized, causing excessive condensation

Example C: Draft-Hood-Equipped Appliance with
Tile-Lined Chimney
Identify Parameters
An 80 MBtu/h replacement
boiler is being installed in a
bungalow with an internal, tile-
lined masonry chimney. It has a
height of 15 ft, and a single-
wall lateral vent connector with
a length of 2 ft. The chimney
and its 8 × 8 inch liner are in
good condition.
Determine Vent
Connector Size
Using Table C.6, find the row
with a height of 15 ft and a
lateral length of 2 ft. Proceed
across until you find a DP
capacity greater than 80
MBtu/h under the NAT
column. The appropriate
capacity indicates a minimum
vent connector diameter of 5
inches.
Check Chimney Liner
Size
The area of the 8 × 8 inch liner
is 42.7 square inches, which is
between the minimum (28)
and maximum (137) square
inches, so the liner is
acceptable.
Verify Capacity Limit
For an input of 80 MBtu/h, the
limit is 80 × 1.25 = 100 MBtu/h.
The listed capacity of the
chimney is 97 MBtu/h - the
chimney liner is still okay.

Two or More Fan-Assisted
Appliances Connected to a
Type B Common Vent
You may perform the sizing of vent connectors and the common vent
serving two or more fan-assisted appliances using Code Tables C.3 and
C.4.
Table C.3

Use in situations where a single-wall vent connector is used

Example D: Two Fan-Assisted Appliances
Identify Parameters
A fan-assisted furnace (40 MBtu/h,
vent connector rise of 2 ft) and a fan-
assisted boiler (80 MBtu/h, vent
connector rise of 3 ft) are being
installed with a Type B common vent
with a height of 20 ft.
Size Vent Connectors
For the furnace, find the row with a
height of 20 ft and rise of 2 ft. The
appropriate range is 22 to 57 MBtu/h,
requiring a 3 inch vent connector. For
the boiler, a 4 inch vent connector is
required.
Size Common Vent
The combined capacity is 40 + 80 = 120
MBtu/h. Find the first FAN + FAN
column equal to or greater than 120. A
capacity of 136 MBtu/h corresponds to
a 4 inch common vent size.

The combined capacity is 40
+ 80 = 120 MBtu/h. The DP
(N+N) column lists a capacity
of 166 MBtu/h corresponding
to a 5 inch common vent size.

requiring a 4 inch vent
connector.
Size Boiler Vent
Connector
Using a rise of 3 ft and an
input of 80 MBtu/h, a 4 inch
vent connector is required.
Size Common Vent
The combined capacity is 40
+ 80 = 120 MBtu/h. The DP
(F+N) column lists a capacity
of 165 MBtu/h
corresponding to a 5 inch
common vent size.

A Fan-Assisted Appliance and a Draft-Hood-Equipped Appliance Connected to a Tile-Lined Chimney
Example G presents the situation where replacing older appliances that are connected to a tile-lined masonry chimney is necessary. In this case, unlike Example C, the chimney is oversized, and this example explains how to determine over sizing.
Identify Parameters
Fan-assisted boiler (80 MBtu/h, rise of 1 ft) and draft-hood-equipped water heater (40 MBtu/h, rise of 2 ft) with a 30 ft chimney with an 8 x 12 inch tile liner
Size Vent Connectors
Both appliances require 4 inch vent connectors based on Table C.7
Check Minimum Size
The combined capacity is 120 MBtu/h, requiring a minimum internal chimney area of 28 square inches. The 8 × 12 inch tile liner has an area of 63.6 square inches - not too small.
Check Maximum Size
The limit is 120 × 1.25 = 150 MBtu/h. The listed capacity is 251 MBtu/h, so the chimney is oversized and not permissible.

Example G: Oversized Chimney
Solution
When a chimney is determined to be oversized, a certified liner or B-vent must be
installed. This is a common situation when replacing older appliances connected to a
tile-lined masonry chimney.
Important Considerations
In most practical cases, because
of the large size of typical
chimney flues, venting an
appliance to a tile-lined chimney
is not permissible or advisable,
and in many jurisdictions, this
practice is prohibited.
Fan-Assisted Appliance
Restriction
The Code also prohibits the
venting of a single fan-assisted
appliance to a tile-lined chimney
because of the potential for
excessive condensation.
Local Consultation
Consult with your local utility or authority having jurisdiction for specific
requirements in your area.

Fan-Assisted and Draft-Hood-Equipped Appliances with Type B Vent Connectors to Certified Corrugated
Liner
When a certified corrugated liner is used, Clause C2.2.11 of the General venting requirements requires a 20% reduction of the capacity. In other words, the corrugated liner carries only 80% of the listed capacity in the Tables.
Adjust Capacity
A simple way to find the correct diameter of the liner is to adjust the capacity of the
appliance by taking 100 MBtu/h ÷ 80% = 125 MBtu/h.
Determine Liner Size
Using Table C.3, Common vent capacity, and a height of 30 ft, the first DP (F+N) column
with a listed capacity equal to or greater than 125 MBtu/h is 128 MBtu/h, corresponding to
a 4 inch diameter vent.
Verify Capacity
Check by taking 128 × 0.8 = 102.4 MBtu/h, which is greater than 100 MBtu/h, confirming
the liner is adequate.

Fan-Assisted and Draft-Hood-Equipped Appliances with Type B Vent Connector Manifold to Common
Vent
A vent connector manifold is defined as any horizontal section of a vent connector upstream of the vertical common vent connected to two or more appliances.
Identify Parameters
A 40 MBtu/h draft-hood-equipped water heater (rise of 1 ft) and a
60 MBtu/h fan-assisted furnace (rise of 2 ft) with a 30 ft common
vent. Both vent connectors are single-wall type attached to a vent
connector manifold.
Size Vent Connectors
The water heater requires a 4 inch vent connector, and the furnace
requires a 3 inch connector.
Adjust for Manifold
General venting requirement No. 4 requires a 10% reduction of the
common vent capacity to 90% when a vent connector manifold is
used. Adjust the capacity: 100 MBtu/h ÷ 90% = 111 MBtu/h.
Size Common Vent
The 4 inch common vent has a capacity of 123 MBtu/h and may be
used.

Fan-Assisted and Draft-Hood-Equipped Appliances with Single-Wall Vent Connectors to Common B-
Vent with Offset
When a common vent requires an offset to bypass existing ductwork and piping, additional adjustments must be made to the vent capacity.
Identify Parameters
A 40 MBtu/h draft-hood-equipped water heater (rise of 2 ft) and a
90 MBtu/h fan-assisted furnace (rise of 3 ft) with a 30 ft common
vent with an offset. Both vent connectors are single-wall type.
Size Vent Connectors
The water heater requires a 4 inch vent connector, and the furnace
requires a 4 inch connector.
Adjust for Offset
General venting requirement No. 5 requires a 20% reduction of the
common vent capacity to 80% when a common vent offset is used.
Adjust the capacity: 130 MBtu/h ÷ 80% = 162.5 MBtu/h.
Size Common Vent
The 5 inch common vent has a capacity of 188 MBtu/h and may be
used. The length of the offset would be limited to a maximum of

## 7.5 ft.


Interpolating Between Table Values
When the actual installation parameters don't exactly match the values in the tables, interpolation can be used to determine the correct vent capacity.
Worst Case Scenario Approach
Select the next lowest height in the table. If the system would adequately vent at the lower height, it will operate even better at the
actual height.
Example: For a 12 ft height, use the 10 ft row in the table. If the capacity at 10 ft is sufficient, the 12 ft system will work.
Interpolation Approach
Calculate the precise capacity by interpolating between the values in the table.
Example: For a 12 ft height, find the capacity at 10 ft (77 MBtu/h) and 15 ft (87 MBtu/h). The difference is 10 MBtu/h. The capacity at 12 ft
is 77 + (2/5 × 10) = 81 MBtu/h.

Sizing a Venting System: Prerequisites
The vent sizing tables in CSA B149.1 are based on two basic prerequisites that must be satisfied before the tables can be
applied:
House Depressurization Limit
The building where the installation of the appliances is to
take place must not develop depressurization greater
than 0.02 inch w.c. (5 Pa), the House Depressurization
Limit (HDL). If the use of HDL cannot lead to a reliable
control of house pressures, do not install fan-assisted
and draft-hood appliances, and vent sizing tables thus do
not apply.
Venting System Layout
The layout of the venting system must fall within the
limits of the vent sizing tables in terms of vent height,
length of laterals, vent connector rise, and vent sizes. If
any aspect of the venting system exceeds these
limitations, do not use the venting tables, as the system
must be designed according to the approved practices.

Example 1: Fan-Assisted Appliance with Single-Wall Vent Connector to B-Vent
Identify Parameters
An 80 MBtu/h input fan-assisted appliance with 10 ft of lateral
connector attached to a 30 ft high Type B vent. Two 90-degree
elbows are needed.
Consult Table C.2
Find the row with a height of 30 ft and a lateral of 10 ft. A 3 inch
diameter single-wall metal connector is not recommended.
Check Larger Size
A 4 inch diameter single-wall metal connector has a minimum
capacity of 91 MBtu/h and a maximum of 144 MBtu/h. The 80
MBtu/h appliance is outside this range.
Consider Alternatives
Moving the appliance to within 5 ft of the vertical vent would allow
a 4 inch single-wall connector. Alternatively, using a Type B vent
connector would work with the original 10 ft lateral.

Example 2: Draft-Hood-Equipped Appliance with Single-Wall Vent Connector to B-Vent
A 120 MBtu/h input appliance with a 5 ft lateral vent connector that requires venting into a 10 ft high Type B vent system.
Scenario 1: Loose Structure, 2 Elbows
Using Table C.2, find the row with a height of 10 ft and lateral of 5 ft. A 5 inch diameter
vent has a capacity of 122 MBtu/h and should be used.
Scenario 2: Loose Structure, 3 Elbows
Reduce the maximum vent capacity by 10%: 122 × 0.90 = 110 MBtu/h for a 5 inch vent—
not sufficient. A 6 inch vent with adjusted capacity of 167 MBtu/h is required.
Scenario 3: Tight Structure with Depressurization
Read across to the NAT DP column until a vent capacity greater than 120 MBtu/h is
located. A 6 inch diameter vent has a capacity of 149 MBtu/h and may be used.

Example 3: Draft-Hood-Equipped Appliance with Single-Wall Vent Connector to Tile-Lined Chimney
Identify Parameters

Determine Vent Connector Size
Using Table C.6, find the row with a height of 15 ft and lateral of 10
ft. A 7 inch diameter connector has a listed capacity of 182 MBtu/h.
Check Chimney Size
The internal area of the 8 × 8 inch chimney is 42.7 square inches,
which is not within the acceptable range (50 to 269 square inches)
for a 7 inch vent connector.
Determine Liner Size
Using Table C.2 for a smooth-walled liner, a 6 inch diameter vent
connector and liner is required (capacity of 173 MBtu/h).

Example 4: Single Draft-Hood-Equipped Appliance with Single-Wall Vent Connector to Certified
Corrugated Liner
When a certified corrugated liner is used, Clause C.2.11 of the General Venting Requirements requires a 20% reduction of the capacity. In other words, the corrugated liner carries only 80% of the listed capacity in the Tables.
Adjust Capacity
Adjust the appliance input: 135 ÷ 80% = 168.75 MBtu/h
Determine Liner Size
Using Table C.2, with a height of 15 ft and a lateral of 10 ft, the first NAT DP column with a
listed capacity equal to or greater than 168.75 MBtu/h is 173 MBtu/h, corresponding to a 6
inch diameter.
Verify Capacity
Check by taking 173 × 80% = 138.4 MBtu/h, which is greater than 135 MBtu/h, confirming
the liner is adequate.

required.
Size Furnace Vent Connector
A 4 inch vent connector has a maximum input rating of 111 MBtu/h
and a minimum input rating of 37 MBtu/h, which is adequate for
the 60 MBtu/h furnace.
Check Chimney Size
The internal area of the 8 × 12 inch liner is 63.6 square inches. A
chimney with a minimum internal area of 28 square inches
provides a capacity of 251 MBtu/h, which exceeds the limit of 100 ×

## 1.25 = 125 MBtu/h. The chimney is oversized.


Example 9: Fan-Assisted and Draft-Hood-Equipped Appliances with Type B Vent Connectors to Certified
Corrugated Liner
This example addresses the oversized chimney issue identified in Example 8 by using a certified corrugated liner.
Adjust Capacity
Adjust the combined appliance input: 100 MBtu/h ÷ 80% = 125 MBtu/h
Determine Liner Size
Using Table C.3, Common vent capacity, and a height of 30 ft, the first DP (F+N) column
with a listed capacity equal to or greater than 125 MBtu/h is 128 MBtu/h, corresponding to
a 4 inch diameter vent.
Verify Capacity
Check by taking 128 × 0.8 = 102.4 MBtu/h, which is greater than 100 MBtu/h, confirming
the liner is adequate.

Example 10: Fan-Assisted and Draft-Hood-Equipped Appliances with Type B Vent Connector Manifold to
Common Vent
Identify Parameters
A 40 MBtu/h draft-hood-equipped water heater (rise of 1 ft) and a
60 MBtu/h fan-assisted furnace (rise of 2 ft) with a 30 ft common
vent. Both vent connectors are single-wall type attached to a vent
connector manifold.
Size Water Heater Vent Connector
Using Table C.4, find the row with a height of 30 ft and rise of 1 ft. A
4 inch vent connector has a maximum input rating of 53 MBtu/h,
which is adequate.
Size Furnace Vent Connector
A 3 inch vent connector has a minimum input rating of 50 MBtu/h
and a maximum input rating of 62 MBtu/h, which is adequate for
the 60 MBtu/h furnace.
Size Common Vent
Adjust the combined capacity for the manifold: 100 MBtu/h ÷ 90%
= 111 MBtu/h. A 4 inch common vent has a capacity of 123 MBtu/h
and may be used.

Example 11: Fan-Assisted and Draft-Hood-Equipped Appliances with Single-Wall Vent Connectors to

the 90 MBtu/h furnace.
Size Common Vent
Adjust the combined capacity for the offset: 130 MBtu/h ÷ 80% =

## 162.5 MBtu/h. A 5 inch common vent has a capacity of 188 MBtu/h

and may be used. The length of the offset would be limited to a
maximum of 7.5 ft.

Example 12: Interpolating Between Table Values
An installer has a 75 MBtu/h input appliance with a 4 inch diameter draft-hood outlet that needs to be vented into a 12 ft high Type B vent. The vent connector has a 5 ft lateral length and is also Type B.
Worst Case Scenario Solution
Using Table C.1, since there is no entry for a height of 12 ft, select the next lowest height (10 ft). The capacity value is 77 MBtu/h, which is
greater than the 75 MBtu/h input, so a 4 inch system is adequate.
Interpolation Solution
Find the capacity at 10 ft (77 MBtu/h) and 15 ft (87 MBtu/h). The difference is 10 MBtu/h. The capacity at 12 ft is 77 + (2/5 × 10) = 81

Understanding Vent Capacity Tables
Table Structure
The vent sizing tables are organized by vent diameter,
height, and lateral length. They provide capacity ratings in
thousands of Btu/h for different types of appliances and
venting configurations.
Column Types
FAN columns are used for fan-assisted appliances, while
NAT columns are used for natural draft (draft-hood-
equipped) appliances. The DP column accounts for house
depressurization, while the MAX column is for leaky
structures without air exhausting equipment.

Vent Connector Considerations
Type B Vent Connectors
Double-wall metal vent connectors that provide better
insulation and higher capacity ratings than single-wall
connectors. Use Tables C.1 and C.3 for sizing.
Single-Wall Vent Connectors
Less expensive but have lower capacity ratings and
require greater clearance to combustibles. Use Tables
C.2 and C.4 for sizing.
Connector Rise
The vertical distance from the appliance outlet to the
horizontal run. Greater rise improves venting
performance and increases capacity ratings.
Lateral Length
The horizontal distance from the vertical rise to the
vertical vent. Longer laterals reduce capacity ratings and
should be minimized when possible.

Common Vent Considerations
Vent Height
The vertical distance from the
connector entrance to the vent
termination. Greater height improves
venting performance and increases
capacity ratings.
Vent Diameter
The smallest acceptable diameter for
vents and vent connectors is
preferred to maintain proper velocity
and minimize condensation.
Vent Offsets
Horizontal shifts in the vertical vent
that reduce capacity by 20%. The
length of the offset is limited to 1.5 ft
for each inch of common vent
diameter.

Chimney Considerations
Tile-Lined Masonry
Chimneys
Existing chimneys must be lined, in
good condition, and located on an
interior wall to prevent excessive
cooling. The liner must not be
oversized to prevent condensation.
Chimney Liner Sizing
The liner must have an internal area
within the minimum and maximum
limits specified in the tables. The
listed capacity must not exceed the
appliance input rating by more than
25%.
Corrugated Liners
Certified corrugated liners require a
20% reduction in capacity
compared to smooth-walled liners.
Adjust the appliance input by
dividing by 80% to determine the
correct liner size.

House Depressurization Considerations
The 0.02 inch w.c. (5 Pa) depressurization represents the threshold beyond which the spillage of fan-assisted and natural draft
appliances will occur. This is a critical safety consideration in vent sizing.
Tight Buildings
Modern, well-sealed buildings are more susceptible to
depressurization from exhaust fans, clothes dryers, and
other air-exhausting equipment. Always use the DP column
for these installations.
Loose Buildings
Older or less well-sealed buildings without air exhausting
equipment may use the MAX column for natural draft
appliances. This applies to structures like sheds or detached
garages.

Vent Sizing Best Practices
1
Determine Appliance Type
Identify whether the appliance is fan-assisted or draft-
hood-equipped (natural draft) to use the correct table
columns.
2
Measure System Dimensions
Accurately measure the vent height, connector rise, and
lateral length to find the correct row in the tables.
3
Assess Building Conditions
Evaluate whether the building is tight or loose and whether
it contains air exhausting equipment to determine whether
to use the DP or MAX column.
4
Apply Adjustment Factors
Account for elbows, manifolds, offsets, and corrugated
liners by applying the appropriate capacity reduction
factors.

Vent Sizing Procedure Summary
Gather Information
Collect appliance input ratings, vent heights, connector rises, and lateral lengths
Select Appropriate Table
Choose the correct table based on connector type and appliance configuration
Find Capacity Values
Locate the appropriate capacity values in the table based on system dimensions
Apply Adjustments
Adjust capacity values for elbows, manifolds, offsets, or corrugated liners
Verify Sizing

Common Venting Errors to Avoid
Undersized Vents
Using a vent with insufficient capacity can lead to poor draft, spillage of flue
gases, and potential carbon monoxide hazards.
Oversized Vents
Using a vent that is too large can cause excessive cooling of flue gases, leading
to condensation, corrosion, and deterioration of the vent system.
Ignoring Adjustment Factors
Failing to account for elbows, manifolds, offsets, or corrugated liners can result
in inadequate venting capacity.
Using Wrong Table Columns
Using the MAX column instead of the DP column in a tight building with air
exhausting equipment can lead to venting problems.

Venting System Safety
Considerations
Carbon Monoxide Hazards
Improper venting can lead to carbon monoxide production and spillage into the living
space, creating a serious health hazard.
Condensation Issues
Excessive condensation in vents can lead to corrosion, deterioration, and eventual failure
of the venting system.
Backdrafting
House depressurization can cause backdrafting, where flue gases are pulled back into the
building instead of being exhausted outdoors.
Safety Devices
Carbon monoxide detectors and spillage switches provide additional safety but do not
replace proper vent sizing and installation.

Consulting with Authorities
In many cases, it's important to consult with local authorities to ensure compliance with regional requirements and best practices.
Local Inspection Authority
Consult when the tables do not show a particular venting
system arrangement or when alternative venting methods are
being considered.
Propane Distributor or Gas Utility
Seek guidance on specific venting requirements and
recommendations for your region and application.
Manufacturer's Instructions
Always follow the manufacturer's certified installation
instructions for specific appliance venting requirements.
Authority Having Jurisdiction
The final decision on venting system approval rests with the
local authority having jurisdiction.

Venting System Inspection
and Maintenance
Visual Inspection
Regularly inspect vents and chimneys for signs of deterioration,
blockages, or improper connections.
Leak Testing
Check for leaks in the venting system that could allow flue gases to
escape into the building.
Cleaning
Remove any debris, nests, or buildup that could restrict the flow of
flue gases.
Component Replacement
Replace any damaged or deteriorated components to maintain
the integrity of the venting system.

Venting System Documentation
Installation Records
Document the vent sizing calculations, including appliance
inputs, system dimensions, and table values used.
Record any adjustments made for elbows, manifolds,
offsets, or corrugated liners.
Inspection Reports
Maintain records of all inspections, including the condition
of the venting system and any issues identified.
Document any repairs or modifications made to the venting
system.

Venting System Upgrades
Replacing Older Appliances
When replacing older appliances with newer, more efficient
models, the existing venting system may need to be
modified or replaced to accommodate the different venting
characteristics.
Fan-assisted appliances typically produce lower volume and
temperature flue gases, requiring careful sizing to prevent
condensation.
Upgrading Venting Materials
Replacing single-wall vent connectors with Type B
connectors can improve venting performance and reduce
clearance requirements.
Installing certified liners in masonry chimneys can address
oversizing issues and improve venting efficiency.

Future Trends in Venting Systems
Higher Efficiency Appliances
As appliance efficiency increases, flue gas temperatures decrease, requiring more
careful vent sizing and potentially different venting materials.
Tighter Building Envelopes
Modern construction techniques create tighter buildings, increasing the importance
of proper vent sizing and consideration of house depressurization.
Advanced Venting Technologies
New venting materials and systems are being developed to address the challenges
of venting high-efficiency appliances in tight buildings.
Environmental Considerations
Increasing focus on reducing emissions and improving indoor air quality will drive
changes in venting system design and requirements.

a natural draft appliance

Introduction to Vent Inspection
Collaboration
For the gas technician/fitter to
deliver a safe, quality appliance
venting system, there must be
collaboration between the gas
technician/fitter and other
trades, and between installers
and inspectors.
Quality Assurance
Installation and inspection are
parts of a single system, with
the inspection process serving
as an independent quality
assurance check on the final
installed appliance.
Inspection Systems
Systems of inspection vary widely among jurisdictions, but it is important
to have inspections performed promptly and completely.

Code Requirements Review
Many of the items in the checklists for appliance installation that are
discussed in Chapter 3. Vent design and installation requirements for
Category 1 appliances apply equally to the inspection process. After an
installation is complete, the gas technician/fitter must ensure that the
following checks are made prior to the inspection.

Pre-Inspection Checklist
Schedule Inspections
Inspections should be arranged in advance to avoid delays after you
have finalized the installation.
Test Flashing
Test the flashing where the vent has penetrated the roof with a water
hose and look for leaks.
Check Appearance
The appearance of the installation should be neat and orderly to an
established standard of workmanship.
Verify Support System
A support system suitable for the weight and design of the material
employed must support the exhaust vent pipe and fittings securely.
The appliances are not designed to support the weight of the vent.

Additional Pre-Inspection
Items
Plastic Venting
Plastic venting must be free to expand and contract.
Fire Penetration
For commercial installations, check for approved and properly installed
fire penetration assemblies.
Protective Screens
Are protective screens or covers in place for sidewall vents?
Two Pipe Systems
Two pipe systems are properly terminated with a cap and or bird
screen.

Type BH Vent Systems
Slope Requirements
Are Type BH vent systems
adequately sloped by to the
appliance condensate trap or
have additional condensate
drains been installed and
piped to drain?
Leak Testing
Ensure there is no flue gas
leakage on non-co-axial Type
BH vents. Use a soapy solution
to check for leaks with the gas
supply turned off and the
exhaust fan running.
Condensate Requirements
Does the local authority require that flue gas condensate be run
through an acid neutralizer before entering the drainage system?

Final Installation Steps
Prime Condensate Traps
Condensate traps should be primed at initial start-up.
Verify Appliance Operation
Ensure all appliances are running in the house.
Provide Owner Instructions
The building owner or occupant should be instructed in the
safe and proper use of the appliances and should be provided
with all relevant instructions, warranties, etc.

Venting System Problems
Overview
Current Building Code requirements for the control of building pressures
and combustion appliance spillage make gas appliance venting and spillage
susceptibility important factors for consideration. Venting system problems
are the most common problem in the gas industry. To avoid venting
problems in the field, the gas technician/fitter should be aware of the most
common causes and how to check for them.
Flue Gas Spillage
Condensation
Corrosion

Flue Gas Spillage
The spillage of combustion products can occur when a spillage-
susceptible appliance is subjected to a sustained negative pressure
greater than the buoyancy venting pressure it can establish during its
operation.
Flue gas spillage is the most serious venting problem, particularly if it is
prolonged. The recirculation of flue gases through the burner of an
appliance creates carbon monoxide, a colourless, odourless and deadly
gas. Even if carbon monoxide is not developed, many people experience
irritation and discomfort from flue gases that spill into the occupied
space of a building.

Common Causes of Spillage
The most common cause of spillage is a failure to control negative air pressures in a building where buoyancy-vented
appliances are installed. This is considered to be the lack of makeup air.

Additional Causes of Spillage
CauseDescription
Blocked or restricted venting systemBirds' nests, debris, and incorrectly sized
vent caps (rain caps) have been known to
cause spillage. Blockage by nests, insect
infestations, and accumulated debris can
plug the venting system completely. To
avoid this, install vent caps with screens
and inspect the venting system seasonally.
Incorrectly sized venting systemSpillage can occur when a venting system
is too small, uses an excessive number of
elbows, or includes long lateral runs.
Leaks in venting systemImproperly joined and sealed components
of the venting system can lead to leakage
of flue gases into the building. Observing
proper fitting practices is a must.

Improper Vent
Configuration
Common Vent Issues
This problem is common when fan-assisted and draft-hood-
equipped appliances are connected to a common vent. In such
cases, configure the vent connectors so that the draft-hood-
equipped appliance vent connector enters the common vent above
the fan-assisted vent connector.
Avoiding Flue Gas Diversion
Avoid configurations where it is obvious that flue gases will be
diverted into the building rather than up the common vent.

Spillage Susceptibility
Spillage susceptibility involves both the venting characteristics of the appliance and the method of venting.
Spillage-Susceptible Appliances
Appliances are considered spillage-susceptible in either
situation:
•buoyancy drives venting
•venting system is not gas-tight
Non-Spillage-Susceptible Appliances
Non-spillage-susceptible appliances are power vented to a
gas-tight venting system, making them resistant to spillage
at relatively high negative building pressures.

Pressure Threshold for Spillage
The currently established threshold of negative pressure that an appliance must withstand to be considered non-spillage
susceptible is -0.02 inch w.c. (-5 Pa). This is based on the typical buoyancy venting pressure developed by natural draft and
fan-assisted appliances.
Category I and II
Appliances
Based on this threshold, natural
draft and fan-assisted
appliances of the Category I type
are considered spillage
susceptible, as are Category II
appliances. Type B, BW, and L
vents that are not gas-tight are
also considered spillage
susceptible.
Category III and IV
Appliances
Induced or forced-draft gas
appliances (Categories III and IV)
are not considered spillage
susceptible when connected to a
gas-tight venting system (e.g., a
type BH venting system with
sealed joints).
Direct Vent Appliances
Direct vent appliances (in any
Category, I through IV), due to
their sealed method of air supply
and venting, are also considered
non-spillage susceptible.

Practical Installation Guidelines
Avoid Installing
•Category I natural-draft or fan-assisted gas appliances in buildings that
experience greater than -0.02 inch w.c. (-5 Pa) pressure
•appliances connected to Type B, BW, or L venting systems in buildings
exceeding the 0.02 inch w.c. (5 Pa) negative pressure threshold
Consider These Factors
•Does or will the building contain air exhausting appliances without the
provision of makeup air?
•Is the building of recent construction, and does it appear to have a tight
building envelope?
•Does the structure or enclosure comply with Clause 8.2.1 a) or b) of CSA
B149.1?

Condensation in Venting
Systems
In a properly designed and installed venting system, the amount of
condensation forming in the vent is negligible, and as the vent or
chimney warms up during appliance operation, this evaporates and
travels to the outdoors.
Avoid excessive condensation in the venting system. Prolonged periods
of condensation can lead to puddles of water in the building and to
moisture damage within the fabric of the building if condensate leaks
through joints in the concealed sections of the venting system.
Corrosion of metal vents may also occur as a result of prolonged
condensation.

Causes of Condensation: Cold Vents
Cold Vents or Chimneys
All Category I appliance vents and chimneys must be warm to perform properly
Exterior Placement Issues
Avoid exterior vents and chimneys unless these are properly insulated
Winter Performance
Cold vents and chimneys that are not properly insulated
will cause condensation throughout the entire operating
time during colder periods

Causes of Condensation: Oversized Systems
Surface Area Problems
An oversized venting system can lead
to condensation problems because
the internal surface area of the vent is
too large to warm above the dew
point of the flue gases (127 - 130°F).
Fan-Assisted Appliances
This is particularly the case when fan-
assisted appliances are involved. A
fan-assisted appliance is of higher
efficiency than draft-hood-equipped
appliances; hence, it has a lower flue
gas temperature. There is also no
dilution air entering the venting
system during the operation of fan-
assisted appliances.
Proper Sizing
Always size venting systems serving
fan-assisted appliances using the
minimum allowable vent diameters.

Corrosion in Venting Systems
Causes of Corrosion
In the venting system, corrosion is most often a secondary
effect of condensation. It may be as a result of the reaction
caused when a chlorinated hydrocarbon is heated in air. In
the presence of a very slight trace of water, it will form
hydrochloric acid, which has a highly corrosive effect on
most metals.
Prevention Measures
Corrosion in a venting system can be a result of either the
flue products condensing in the vent system or an outside
source of corrosive vapours. To avoid corrosion problems
due to condensation, you may use only venting systems
designed for condensing appliances on condensing
appliances. Conventional venting systems require flue
temperatures above the point at which the flue products will
start to condense.

Other Venting System Problems
Leaking
Joints that aren't properly sealed can
allow flue gases to escape
Sagging
Improper support can cause sections
to sag and collect condensate
Incorrect Grade
Horizontal runs must have proper
upward slope
Poor Location
Terminations in areas affected by
wind or pressure zones
Wind Effect
Cold and hot backdraft caused by
wind conditions

Checking Venting System
Operation
Fan-assisted and draft hood combustion appliances, when used alone or
in combination, can cause a variety of problems in the operation of the
venting system. This is, in part, because of many variables in both
appliance operation and the location and environment surrounding the
appliance venting systems.

Detecting Spillage
Draft hood spillage is the escape of flue gases from the relief opening of the draft hood of a natural draft appliance. On start-
up, a little spillage of short duration is normal, but if it does not stop after a minute or two, there may be something wrong in the
venting system.
Detection Methods
•Introducing smoke into the flue products ahead of the
draft hood
•Observing if the flame of a match goes out when it is held
at the edge of the draft hood relief opening

Smoke Taper Test Procedure
Complete Connections
After all gas piping, electrical,
and vent connections are in
place, proceed with testing
Adjust and Light
Adjust the appliance and light
the main burner, allowing
several minutes for warm-up
Hold Taper
Hold a lighted taper just under
the rim of the draft hood relief
opening
Observe Smoke Flow
Proper venting will draw the
taper smoke towards or into the
draft hood. The escape or
spillage of burned gas through
improper venting will cause the
smoke to blow away from the
relief opening

Problems in the Vent
Where there is continued draft hood spillage due to problems in the vent itself,
the installer should check for one or several of the following possible causes:
Size Issues
Inadequate connector size in a combined venting system
Rise Problems
Insufficient connector rise in a combined venting system
Blockage
Blockage in the system, which may be partial or total
Length Issues
An excessively long connector (especially if it is single-wall)

Additional Vent Problems
Directional Changes
Too many fittings that change direction cause excessive flow
resistance
Height Issues
Vent not high enough
Cap Problems
Incorrect cap causes flow restriction
Pressure Issues
Building depressurization and pressure from thermal effects

Troubleshooting Vent
Problems
Determining the Cause
Once you determine the cause as one of the above, you can find the
remedy by checking the vent against the Code tables if it is
otherwise unobstructed.
Low Resistance Caps
In some instances, it has been found that using a listed vent cap of
low resistance will solve the problem.

Appliance Fails to Operate
There are many possible reasons why an appliance fails to operate, some of which may be related to the venting system.
Others may be due to burner ignition or other control difficulties.
Venting-Related Issues
•An undersized or otherwise improperly designed venting
system may cause a venting safety control to prevent
burner ignition or shut it down if draft hood spillage
occurs
•With a fan-assisted combustion appliance, under
Category I conditions, positive pressure in the vent or
inadequate vent flow may prevent or interrupt burner
operation
Safety Controls
With a draft hood appliance equipped with a blocked vent
detection device (also called a spill switch), the burner may
shut off if spillage continues for a period of time, or the
burner may operate intermittently for short periods. Its
duration of operation may depend on how long it takes for
the spillage detection control to be activated.

Troubleshooting Approach
IfThen
The vent is causing this
problem.
Check the size and
configuration against the
tables. Check also for blockage,
an improper vent cap, or
building depressurization.
The venting system is correct,
and there are no adverse indoor
pressure conditions.
Finding the cause depends on a
careful analysis of the
manufacturer's instructions for
appliance installation,
operation, and troubleshooting.

Cold Backdraft
Normal Condition
A draft hood appliance not
operating and cold air coming out
of the relief opening is not a venting
malfunction. For this to occur, there
must be an indoor-outdoor
temperature difference that causes
cold air to be drawn down the vent,
such as might occur if the vertical
vent piping is entirely outdoors.
Other Causes
This flow reversal can also result
from fan or fireplace operation.
Wind Effects
Winds can cause a cold backdraft. A
wind blowing against the wall can
easily reverse a vent terminating
improperly next to an outside wall
or below the eaves. Cold air enters
the vent and exits through the draft
hood because the vent acts just like
a hole in the wall or an open
window.

Hot Backdraft
Cold Backdraft First
A hot backdraft can occur if a cold backdraft has reversed flow in the
vent and the appliance burner comes on
Appears as Spillage
With cold air entering the top and flowing downward in the vent, this
appears to be draft hood spillage
Total Spillage
This causes total spillage of hot flue products because the vent does
not carry away any flue products
Wind Factors
If indoor mechanical equipment causes the cold backdraft, the vent
may never prime. But where there is an unsteady wind, a drop in wind
velocity may allow the vent to get started correctly

Combined System Hot
Backdraft
A hot backdraft can also occur in a venting system combining a fan-
assisted appliance with a NAT (Natural Draft) appliance. If the common
vent has insufficient capacity for the fan-assisted appliance, or if it
becomes blocked, some or all the products of combustion from the fan-
assisted appliance will be flowing out to the NAT appliance's draft hood.
If the NAT appliance operates under these conditions, it will experience
total spillage as well. If this occurs, shut off both appliances until the
situation is corrected.

Leakage at Joints
Fan Pressure
The vent pressure capability of fan-
assisted appliances varies widely, but
regardless, a fan can produce more
pressure in a vent than gravity flow
Draft Hood Requirements
Draft hood appliances must have
negative or below atmospheric
pressure at the draft hood to draw in
dilution air and prevent spillage
Positive Pressure
A fan-assisted appliance can produce
both positive pressure and adequate
vent flow at the same time
Category Differences
Only Category I and Category III
appliances have high enough vent
temperatures to obtain gravity flow

Causes of Joint Leakage
Leakage of products of combustion can occur at piping and fitting joints
or between elbow segments if there is positive vent pressure. This could
be due to:
Control Malfunction
Control malfunction on the
appliance
Undersized Vent
An undersized vent
Incorrect Vent Type
Any use of Type B gas vent on an appliance that creates positive
pressure

Remedies for Joint Leakage
Correct Solution
The remedy to positive pressure causing joint leakage problems with
either a Category I or III appliance is to use a larger or higher vent
with increased capacity or to reduce its flow resistance.
Incorrect Solution
B-vents should not be used with Category III appliances.
The incorrect remedy and one that violates the Type B product
listing is to tape the joints externally.

Coaxial Venting Leak Test
Identify the Problem
Continuous short cycling of
a coaxial direct vented
appliance can indicate a
leaking venting system,
where flue gas is being
drawn into the combustion
air
Perform Test
Some manufacturers
recommend that a leak test
be performed at start-up on
coaxial direct vent systems
Measure CO2
You can check this by
measuring the CO2
concentration of the
combustion air in the
annular gap of the air intake
pipe
Interpret Results
The vent pipe is considered
sufficiently leak-proof if a
CO2 concentration in the
combustion air no higher
than 0.2% or an O₂
concentration no lower than

## 20.6 % is measured relative

to a starting O2
concentration of 20.9%

Condensation Leakage
Efficiency Factors
With appliances operating at average steady state
efficiencies of 75 to 80%, the probability of condensed water
dripping from Type B is so low that you can consider it
negligible. This applies to most draft hood equipped
appliances.
When steady state efficiencies rise above 80% and the
appliance has no draft hood, the water vapour concentration
in the vent will be higher; thus, water can condense at a
higher temperature (as there is higher dew point because
there is no draft hood dilution air).
Risk Factors
If the vent gases undergo excessive cooling, as with long
laterals in cold, unheated locations, condensation leakage
occurs if the vent does not warm up or there are repeated
short operating cycles.
Condensate leakage is also a possibility if you use a Type B
vent on a Category II or Category IV appliance. The gravity
venting capability of a Category II appliance is marginal, and
it is not possible to determine a usable minimum capacity.
Any Type B gas vent used on either a Category II or Category
IV appliance is not allowed, will cause serious problems, and
should be replaced with a vent suitable for the application.

Gas and Condensate
Leakage
Category IV Appliances
A Category IV appliance, falling in the very high efficiency class,
produces positive vent pressure and very wet flue products at a
temperature that is too low for gravity venting.
Special Venting Requirements
Category IV appliances require "special gas vents", the type of which
may be furnished or specified by the appliance manufacturer. There
is no other choice.

Blocked Venting Systems
An inspection cap located at the base of the vent or a
chimney cleanout opening provides the most convenient
means of enabling inspection and cleanout of blocked
venting systems.
Incorrectly sized vent caps have also been known to
contribute to spillage problems.
If too small a vent cap is installed, it can cause flue gases to
back up and spill into the building.
Check the size and capacity of vent caps carefully, and
install only caps and base-tees certified for use with the
manufacturer's venting system.

Combustion Air Supply for
Gas Appliances
The gas technician/fitter must distinguish between airtight buildings and
install an air supply that will ensure the appliance operates safely and
efficiently.

Learning Objectives

Key Terminology
Building with a tight envelope
Building that does not permit air infiltration from outside.
Room air systems
Systems where appliances draw combustion air from the internal room air.
Direct vent systems
Systems with sealed combustion chambers where all air for combustion is
taken from outside.
Concentric pipe
A venting configuration where combustion air and exhaust flow through a
single connection with hot exhaust exiting through the interior tube.

Methods of Providing Combustion Air
All gas appliances require an adequate supply of air for safe, efficient combustion and control of the venting system. The air
supply requirement and method of delivery are dictated by the type of gas appliance. Higher-efficient appliances require less
air than natural draft appliances and often have the air supply piped directly to them.
For all gas appliances, the source environment of the air supply is critical. Combustion air must be free of corrosive chemicals
and excessive local atmospheric pressure fluctuations.
There are two common methods of appliance air supply: direct vent systems and room air systems (non-direct vent).

Room Air Systems
Mid- and lower-efficient appliances have unsealed combustion
chambers and draw all air supply requirements from the internal
room air.
In some large warehouse-type buildings, there is enough
combustion air within the building's structure. Even in these
instances, the indoor air supply may not be suitable where is
excessive dust or corrosive atmospheric conditions.
For a room air dependent gas appliance, the outside air is normally
brought to the gas appliance burner in two ways: via ducts or
through a hole in the wall. These methods are referred to as passive
air supply compared to a mechanical air supply such as a fan.
If a mechanical air supply is used, it must be properly sized and
interlocked with the appliances to shut off the gas in the event of
an air supply failure.

Direct Vent Systems Overview
The majority of modern appliances are of the direct vent type, which have a sealed combustion chamber where all air for combustion is taken from the
outside atmosphere as well as the products of combustion are discharged to the outdoors.
Enhanced Safety
Sealed combustion chambers prevent combustion gases from entering living spaces
Improved Efficiency
Direct venting reduces heat loss and improves overall appliance performance
Flexible Installation
Can be installed in various configurations to suit different building requirements

Concentric Coaxial Pipe Systems
How Concentric Vents Work
For coaxial vents, the combustion air and exhaust flow directly through a single
connection to the appliance. Hot exhaust exits through the interior tube, while
combustion air enters through the outer layer.
This design creates an efficient system where incoming air is preheated by the
exhaust, improving overall efficiency.
Concentric pipe systems provide a clean, compact installation with only one
penetration through the building envelope.

Twin Pipe Direct Vent Systems
Twin pipe systems require two separate penetrations through the building
envelope.
Twin Pipe Configuration
For twin pipe direct vent systems, the combustion air and exhaust flow directly
through separate pipes and penetrations.
This configuration allows for more flexibility in installation, as the intake and
exhaust can be positioned in different locations to optimize performance.
Twin pipe systems are often used when longer vent runs are required, as they can
provide better flow characteristics in certain installations.

Direct Vent Starter Adapters
Many direct vent appliances are designed to be installed
using either vent piping option through various
manufactures' starter adapters.
These adapters allow for flexibility in installation, enabling
technicians to choose the most appropriate venting system
for the specific application and building requirements.
Examples of direct vent starter adapters that convert
between different venting configurations.

Direct Vent as Room Air Dependent
Dual-Mode Operation
Direct vent appliances may also be
installed as room air dependent
systems, where the room air supply
needs to conform to the manufacturer's
instructions as well as to CSA B149.1.
Installation Requirements
When installed as room air dependent,
proper sizing of air supply openings
becomes critical to ensure safe and
efficient operation.
Manufacturer Guidelines
Always follow manufacturer's certified
instructions for proper installation
configuration.

Direct Vent Termination Options
There are also many termination options available for direct vent systems, including
adapters that enable the installer to convert a two-pipe system to a concentric
termination.
These termination options provide flexibility in installation while maintaining the
safety and efficiency benefits of direct venting.

roof structure.

Direct Vent Installation
Considerations
Follow Manufacturer Instructions
Critical that installations be completed per manufacturer's certified
instructions
Select Proper Materials
Use only approved venting materials specified by the manufacturer
Choose Appropriate Configuration
Select concentric or twin pipe based on installation requirements
Proper Termination
Ensure vent terminations meet code requirements for clearances

Ventilation and Ducting Requirements
CSA B149.1 Compliance
Air-supply openings and ducts
must comply with Clauses 8.3
and 8.5
High-Input Appliances
Spaces with appliances
exceeding 400 MBtu/h (120 kW)
require ventilation openings at
the highest practical point
Discharge Opening
Placement
Must be located where cold air
won't affect pipes and
equipment
Inlet Protection
Must not permit entry of rain or wind and must
maintain required free area
Clearance Requirements
Air-supply opening shall not be located within 3 ft (1
m) of a moisture exhaust duct

Air Supply Opening Placement
The discharge opening of an air supply duct must be located where cold air will not affect steam or water
pipes and electrical or mechanical equipment.
Proper placement ensures that the incoming air doesn't create adverse conditions for other building
systems and components.
Drawing N.T.S. showing proper placement of air supply openings relative to other building components.

Air Supply Opening Requirements
Calculating Free Area
To calculate the free area of an air supply opening, subtract
blockage areas of fixed louvres, grilles, or screens from the
gross opening area.
Free area = gross area - Blockage area of louves, grilles, or
screens
Minimum Aperture Size
The smallest dimension of aperture in a fixed louvre, grille,
or screen is 0.25 inches (6 mm).
Diagram showing how to calculate the free area of an air
supply opening by accounting for blockages.

Damper Requirements for Air Supply
Manual Dampers Prohibited
The use of manually operated dampers or manually adjustable louvres is not permitted.
Automatic Damper Interlocking
An automatically operated damper or automatically adjustable louvre shall be interlocked so
the main burner cannot operate unless either the damper or louvre is fully open.
Certification Requirement
Automatic combustion air dampers installed in the air supply of a dwelling shall be certified.
Safety Considerations
These requirements ensure that combustion air is always available when the appliance is
operating, preventing dangerous conditions.

Length of Air Supply Ducts
Flow Restrictions
When the air supply duct or pipe is being used for a direct vent or a room air system and
when the pipe or duct is too long, it will restrict the flow of air.
Fittings also create addition resistance to flow, so pipes should be routed as directly as
possible with as few bends as possible.
Example of a room air system effective length calculation, referencing CSA B149.1 sizing
tables which have limitations on the duct length.

Direct Vent Equivalent Length
Direct vent equivalent length diagrams showing how to measure
different configurations.
Manufacturer Specifications
For direct vent systems, the maximum equivalent length is
specified in the installation instructions for the type of piping
system.
The diagrams show two manufacturers' drawings detailing how
the two different vent piping configurations are measured.
There would be a fitting equivalent length table for either fitting
types in the manufacturer's instructions.
Notice that the total equivalent length specified for a two-pipe
system is the combined length of the exhaust vent/air intake
pipe system.

Building Types Overview
Platform Frame
Most common construction type in
Canada
Used with brick, stucco, or vinyl
veneer housing
Balloon Frame
Older construction method
Continuous studs from foundation to
roof
Double/Solid Brick
Traditional masonry construction
Provides thermal mass but different air
infiltration characteristics
The three main house construction types in Canada are platform frame, balloon frame, and double/solid brick. Platform frame,
used with brick, stucco, or vinyl veneer housing, is the most common. More detailed descriptions of all three construction types
are found in Unit 14 The building as a system.

Airtight Building Envelopes
Modern Construction Challenges
With the introduction of new building materials and
techniques and the growing emphasis on energy efficiency,
modern buildings have become increasingly airtight.
In homes with airtight envelopes, traditional gas appliance
performance may be affected in varying degrees.
Combustion appliances that operated quite well in the
relatively leaky building envelopes of the past may not be so
efficient in air-sealed modern buildings or retrofitted
homes.
Installer Responsibilities
The ventilation system installer (often the gas appliance
installer) is responsible for ensuring that the
depressurization requirement is met-i.e., that
depressurization in a building with spillage-susceptible
appliances must be limited to -0.02 inch w.c. (-5 Pa) to
eliminate the risk of spillage.
The installer needs to understand that the operation and air
requirements of combustion appliances must work in
conjunction with other air exhausting equipment installed in
airtight buildings.

Building-as-a-System Principles
System Integration
All building components work together
Airflow Management
Controlled air movement throughout the building
Pressure Relationships
Maintaining appropriate pressure differentials
Occupant Safety
Ensuring health and comfort of building users
Sound knowledge of "building-as-a-system" principles helps to minimize conditions that can affect appliance performance and to
ensure the health and safety of the occupants.

Determining Need for Outside Air Supply
Practical Challenges
A practical difficulty is determining whether a building is
sufficiently tight to require an outside combustion/dilution
air supply. This is often the case when dealing with an
existing building that is being renovated or retrofitted.
Most new homes require outside combustion/dilution air.
These are usually tightly sealed homes in which a great deal
of care has been taken to air-seal the building envelope.
Testing Methods
A fan depressurization test will determine whether the
equivalent leakage area is less than 78 square inches, as
required in CSA B149.1.
Some authorities having jurisdiction over gas installations
provide advisories, bulletins, or amendments to CSA B149.1
that provide further direction on when outside air openings
are required.

Ontario's Specific
Requirements
In Ontario, Clause 8.2.1(a) of CSA B149.1-15 has been amended to read
as follows: An outdoor air supply sized in accordance with Clause 8.2.2
shall be provided for an enclosure or a structure in which an appliance
is installed when the enclosure or structure A) has a vapour or air
barrier with joints continuously sealed by taping or caulking in all
thermally insulated walls, ceilings and floors
This amendment provides clearer guidance for installers in Ontario
regarding when an outdoor air supply is required for gas appliances.
Always check with your local authority regarding the definition of a
tightly constructed building, as requirements may vary by jurisdiction.

Air Supply Requirements Flowchart
Figure 6-11 is a flowchart showing different building types and air requirements. This flowchart can be
used to determine the air supply requirements applicable to various building types and installations.
The chart provides a systematic approach to evaluating building characteristics and appliance types to
determine the appropriate air supply requirements.
Flowchart for determining air supply requirements in various situations.

Appliances in Sealed Enclosures
Limited Volume Challenge
Where appliances are located in a sealed enclosure
without openings to the rest of the building, an outside
supply of combustion/dilution air is usually required.
This is because the small volume and surface area of the
enclosure cannot provide adequate air supply through air
leakage.
Volume Calculation
For this situation, the volume of the enclosure and Table

## 8.4 of CSA B149.1 should be used to determine air supply

requirements.
Alternative Solution
Providing openings in the enclosure that communicate
with the rest of the building structure can eliminate the
need for outside air supply since the total volume of the
structure may be used in the tables.
Code Reference
The method of providing this communication is found in
Clause 8.2.6 of CSA B149.1.

When in Doubt About Air Supply
Assess the situation
Evaluate building construction and appliance requirements
Consider testing
Fan depressurization test can provide definitive answers
Provide outside air
When uncertain, install outside air supply for safety
When in doubt, an outside air supply may be provided, recognizing that it represents an added cost to the consumer that may
not actually be necessary. From a practical point of view, if no problems are being experienced in homes without outside air
supply to gas appliances in an area, it is unlikely that an outside air supply is required. However, if there are any doubts, an
outside air supply should be provided.

Purpose of Combustion Air Supply
Clean Air for Combustion
The main purpose of the combustion air supply is to provide a clean air supply for
combustion.
For example, many furnaces and boilers are located in laundry rooms whose
atmosphere is exposed to bleach that can react with products of combustion and
corrode heat exchangers.
Preventing Contamination
An outside fresh air opening can reduce the likelihood of contaminated air being
used by the appliance.
This helps protect the appliance components from premature failure and ensures
proper combustion without harmful byproducts.

Air Requirements for Equipment ≤
400 MBtu/h
The Clauses and corresponding Tables in Section 8 of CSA B149.1 show various venting
and air supply requirements for appliances with a total input of 400 MBtu/h (120 kW)
and less. The Tables indicate the minimum size of the required air supply in relation to
the combined input of the gas appliances.

Key Considerations for Air
Supply
Appliance Type and
Location
CSA B149.1 indicates which
Table to use to size air
supply systems for central
heating furnaces, boilers,
and hot water heaters.
Building Construction
CSA B149.1 addresses the
problem of insufficient air
infiltration in airtight
buildings that fails to
provide enough air supply
for gas-fired equipment.
Appliance Draft Control
If an appliance is designed to operate with a draft control device, it
will require a larger volume of air supply than equipment designed
to operate with no draft control device.

Other Appliances Air Supply
Requirements
When an appliance other than a central-heating appliance or a
domestic water is installed in a location where there is insufficient air
for combustion, provisions shall be made to provide an air supply
sized in accordance with Table 8.1 or 8.2.
Although the Code does not specifically name other appliances beyond
central heating furnaces, boilers, and hot water heaters, Clause 8.1.5
provides guidance for other types of gas appliances.
This ensures that all gas appliances, regardless of their specific function,
receive adequate combustion air for safe and efficient operation.

Defining Tightly Constructed Buildings
CSA B149.1 Definition
Clause 8.2.1 of CSA B149.1 defines a tightly constructed building as one that:
a) has windows and doors of either close-fitting or sealed construction, and the
exterior walls are covered by a continuous, sealed vapour barrier and gypsum

Regional Variations
As indicated previously, some jurisdictions like Ontario have amended the
requirements pertaining to outside air supply requirements to clarify these
requirements.
Always check with your local authority regarding the definition of a tightly
constructed building, as interpretations may vary.

The volume of air required for the operation of gas-fired equipment was discussed in detail earlier in this course. The combustion air
and excess air requirements make a combined ratio of 15:1. The dilution air required for flue gas is also at a ratio of 15:1. An appliance that
requires dilution air uses twice the volume of air as an appliance that does not.

Appliances in Airtight Buildings
An outside air supply must always be provided to gas appliances that are installed in buildings with a tight envelope (buildings that do not permit air infiltration
from outside). An opening or duct to the outdoors is the source of the air supply.
With Draft Control Devices
If all of the appliances are equipped with draft control devices, the procedure
is straightforward, use Table 8.1 of CSA B149.1.
For example, with a combined appliance input of 125 MBtu/h, the required free
area of air supply opening would be 18 square inches, with an approximate
equivalent round duct diameter of 5 inches.
Both appliances have draft control devices in a building with an airtight
envelope.

Example 1: Appliances with Draft
Control
Scenario
A single-family dwelling is tightly
constructed--complying with
Clause 8.2.1 a) or b). It has a boiler
rated at 200 MBtu/h and a hot water
heater rated at 90 MBtu/h. Both
appliances are equipped with draft
control devices. The air supply is
brought from outdoors through a
duct.
Calculation
Refer to Table 8.1:
Total input = 290 Mbtu/h
Use next-largest input = 300
MBtu/h
Result
Area of air supply duct = 43 square inches
Round duct equivalent = 7 inches

Example 2: Appliances Without
Draft Control
Scenario
An airtight structure conforms to
Clause 8.2.1 a) or b). It contains a
boiler rated at 100 MBtu/h and a hot
water heater rated at 36 MBtu/h.
Both appliances are designed for use
with no draft control devices. The air
supply is brought from outdoors
through a duct.
Calculation
Refer to Table 8.2:
Total input = 136 MBtu/h
Use next-largest input = 150 MBtu/h
Result
Area of air supply duct = 11 square inches
Round duct equivalent = 4 inches

Mixed Appliance Types in Airtight Buildings
Code Requirements
In cases where both types of appliances are installed in the same
airtight building (where one appliance has a draft-control device
and the other does not), Clause 8.2.5 of CSA B149.1 provides
specific guidance.
The required free area of the air supply opening shall be the
greater of:
a) that required by Table 8.1, using the total input of only those
appliances having draft-control devices: or
b) that required by Table 8.2, using the total input of all
appliances.
One appliance with draft control, the other without draft control
(fan-assisted).

Example 3: Mixed Appliance Types
Scenario
A structure is tight [it conforms to
Clause 8.2.1 a) or b)]. It has a mid-
efficient furnace rated at 100 MBtu/h
and a hot water heater rated at 40
MBtu/h. The furnace has no draft
control device, but the hot water tank is
equipped with a draft-hood. The air
supply is from outdoors.
Calculation for Draft Control
Appliance
Refer to Table 8.1:
Input of appliance with draft control =
40 MBtu/h
Use next-largest input = 50 MBtu/h
Size = 7 square inches
Calculation for All Appliances
Refer to Table 8.2:
Total of all inputs = 140 MBtu/h
Use next-largest input = 150 MBtu/h
Area of air supply duct = 11 square
inches
Round duct equivalent = 4 inches

Appliances in Non-airtight Buildings
Building Characteristics
Non-airtight buildings ("leaky" or "normal" buildings that are not
extremely airtight) include some new housing as well as existing
buildings-those that do not conform to Code Clauses 8.2.1 a) or b).
The requirements for outside air supply for such buildings are
based on the combined input of the appliances, their draft control
characteristics, and the volume of the structure.
Volume Considerations
If the structure has a large enough volume, sufficient air supply is
delivered through normal air leakage and no additional openings
are required.
Equipment installed in building with enough air volume.

Example 4: Non-airtight
Building
Scenario
A non-airtight structure [that does
not comply with Clause 8.2.1 a) or
b)] is equipped with a boiler rated
at 150 MBtu/h and a hot water
rated at 60 MBtu/h. Both
appliances are equipped with draft
control devices. The volume of the
structure is 10,000 cu ft.
Calculation
Refer to Table 8.3:
Total input = 210 MBtu/h
Use next-largest input = 225
MBtu/h
For under 10,000 cu ft volume
Result
Area of air supply duct = 32 square inches
Round duct equivalent = 6 inches

Appliances in Enclosures
Using Building Volume
Where gas appliances are installed in an enclosure within the building
Clause 8.2.6 of CSA B149.1 allows the entire volume of the structure to be
used in the tables. This can avoid the need for an outside air supply if the
structure large enough.
To take advantage of this, openings must be provided in the partition
separating the enclosure from the building.
Non-airtight buildings with appliances located in an enclosure.

Calculating Enclosure Openings
Calculate Free Area
Free area required by Code is 1 square inch per 1,000 Btu/h
For 125 MBtu/h, the required free area is 125 square inches
Locate the opening between 6 and 18 inches (150 and 450 mm) above floor level
Add Ventilation Opening
For appliances with draft control devices, an additional opening of the same
size is required
Locate this opening as close to the ceiling as practical
Always position above the relief opening of the draft control device
Ensure Proper Function
The upper opening is required to ventilate the room
Prevents heat build-up that could affect the safe operation of the draft
control device

Enclosures Without Openings
Special Considerations
Conditions such as excessive dust in a building can impair an appliance's
performance, for this reason, the appliance or appliances have been placed in
an enclosure within the building.
In this case, or in the case of enclosed appliances within very small structure,
ventilation holes are not practical. A separate outside air supply must be
supplied.
Enclosure supplied with a separate outside air supply.
For a volume of 2,000 cu ft and a combined input of 125 MBtu/h, the required
air supply opening is 18 square inches.

Cold Climate Considerations
Insulation Requirements
In cold climates, the gas technician/fitter will consider providing an
outside air supply duct with insulation and a vapor barrier to
minimize condensation on the outside surface of the duct.
If cold air becomes a comfort problem, certified automatic and
interlocked dampers are also available, which only open when the
appliances are operating.
Saskatchewan's acceptable method of installing combustion air
supply to gas-fired appliances under 400 MBtu/h (120 kW).
Some jurisdictions encourage the use of a "P" trap in the air supply
duct to inhibit the flow of heated air out of the air supply duct when
the combustion equipment is not firing. Other jurisdictions may not
accept this method.

Air Requirements for Equipment > 400 MBtu/h
Code Requirements
Air requirements for installations of over 400 MBtu/h (120
kW) are covered by Clause 8.4 of CSA B149.1. The air
requirements fall into two categories: ventilation air and
combustion air supply.
Ventilation Air
Ventilation air openings are supplied to an enclosure
containing gas-fired appliances to allow free circulation of
air. This permits excess heat or combustion products spilled
at the draft-hood to ventilate to the outdoors through
natural convection.
The Code specifies the height and the area of the ventilation
opening or ducting. Whether you have an opening or
ducting to the outdoors depends on the structure of the
building.

Ventilation Air
Requirements
Ventilation of the space occupied by an appliance or equipment shall
be provided by an opening for ventilation air at the highest practicable
point communicating with the outdoors, and this opening shall not
terminate within 12 in (300 mm) of any combustion air opening. The
total cross-sectional area of such an opening shall be at least 10% of
the area required in Clauses 8.4.2 and 8.4.3, but in no case shall the
cross-sectional area be less than 10 in² (6,500 mm²).
This requirement from Clause 8.4.1 ensures proper ventilation of spaces
containing large gas appliances, preventing the buildup of heat and
combustion products.

Combustion Air Supply Categories
Natural Draft Burners
Require air supply at a ratio of 30:1
Fan-Assisted Burners
Also require air supply at a ratio of 30:1
Power Burners
Require air supply at a ratio of 15:1
Blower Incorporation
Power burners incorporate blowers that
draw sufficient air
Understanding this division is important because equipment with a draft control device requires air supply at a ratio of 30:1. Equipment
with no draft control requires air supply at a ratio of 15:1. And power burners that incorporate a blower that can draw enough air into the
burner to provide all air required for combustion and still have the pressure to overcome the resistance of the burner and appliance.

Natural Draft or Fan-Assist Burners
When the air supply is provided by natural airflow from the outdoors for natural-draft, partial fan-assisted, fan-assisted, or
power draft-assisted burners, there shall be a permanent air-supply opening having a cross-sectional area of not less than 1
in²/7,000 Btu/h (310 mm²/kW) up to and including 1,000,000 Btu/h (300 kW), plus 1 in²/14,000 Btu/h (155 mm²/KW) in
excess of 1,000,000 Btu/h (300 kW).
This opening shall be either located at or ducted to a point not more than 18 in (450 mm) or less than 6 in (150 mm) above the
floor level. This air-supply opening requirement shall be in addition to the opening for ventilation air required in Clause 8.4.1.

Appliance with Draft Control Device
Calculation Example
According to Clause 8.4.2, for a 700 MBtu/h boiler, the required
free area = 700,000/7,000 = 100 square inches.
Approximate equivalent round duct diameter = 12 inches.
According to Clause 8.4.1, a ventilation opening no less than 10%
of that calculated under Clause 8.4.2 is required, or a minimum of
10 square inches.
100 x 0.10 = 10 square inches.
Approximate equivalent round duct diameter = 4 inches.
Diagram showing appliance with draft control device and
required air openings.

Example 5: Large Appliances with Draft Control
Scenario
A mechanical room is equipped with gas
appliances with a total combined input of
1600 MBtu/h. All appliances are equipped
with draft control devices.
Calculation
Total input = 1,600 MBtu/h
First 1,000,000 Btu/h requires 1 square
inch per 7,000 Btu/h
1,000,000 ÷ 7,000 = 142.85 square inches
Additional input in excess of 1,000,000
requires 1 square inch per 14,000 Btu/h
600,000 ÷ 14,000 = 42.85 square inches
Result
Total requirements are 142.85 + 42.85 =
186 square inches
Ventilation opening requires 10% of air
supply = 18.6 (19) square inches

Power Burners
Code Requirements
For equipment with a power burner, Clause 8.4.3 requires a permanent air supply
opening having a minimum cross-sectional area of one square inch per 30
MBtu/h (70 mm²/kW) of burner input.
Here too, the Code requires that the location of the air supply openings must not
interfere with the needs of the ventilation air openings referred to in Clause 8.4.1.
Appliance without draft control device.
According to Clause 8.4.3, for a 900 MBtu/h input boiler, the required free area =
900,000/30,000 = 30 square inches. Approximate equivalent round duct
diameter = 6 inches.

Example 6: Power Burner
Appliances
Scenario
A structure is equipped with
appliances rated at 1,500
MBtu/h. None of the appliances
is equipped with draft control
devices.
Calculation
Total input = 1,500 MBtu/h
Each 30,000 Btu/h requires 1
square inch
1,500,000 ÷ 30,000 = 50 square
inches
Result
Free area of air supply = 50 square inches
Ventilation opening requires 10% of air supply or 10 square inches,
whichever is greater = 10 square inches

Mixed Burner Types in Large Installations
For structures containing both natural draft or fan assisted burners and power burners, Clause 8.4.4 prescribes that the cross-
sectional area of the opening(s) be at least the total area required for both types.
In other words, calculate the requirements for equipment falling under Clause 8.4.2 and add these to the requirements for
equipment under Clause 8.4.3 to find the total requirements needed under Clause 8.4. Again, such requirement(s) must be in
addition to the air opening for ventilation air.

Example 7: Mixed Large Appliance Types
Scenario
A structure has a mechanical room into
which air must be ducted from outdoors. It
contains the following appliances:
1. A boiler rated at 1200 MBtu/h, equipped
with a barometric damper
2. Two duct heaters without draft controls
rated at 600 MBtu/h each
3. Two hot water heaters rated at 300
MBtu/h each. Both heaters are equipped
with draft-hoods
Calculation
Total input of appliances with draft control =
1,800 MBtu/h
Total input of appliances without draft
control = 1,200 MBtu/h
First 1,000 MBtu/h with draft control
requires 1 square inch per 7 MBtu/h
1,000 ÷ 7 = 142.8 square inches
Input in excess of 1000 MBtu/h with draft
control requires 800 MBtu/h
1 square inch is required for each 14 MBtu/h
in excess of 1,000 MBtu/h
800 ÷ 14 = 57.2 square inches
Final Calculation
1 square inch is required for each 30 MBtu/h
of appliances without draft control
1,200 ÷ 30 = 40 square inches
Total requirements: 142.8 + 57.2 + 40.0 =

## 240.0 square inches

Free area of supply = 240 square inches
Ventilation opening requires 10% of air
supply = 24 square inches
