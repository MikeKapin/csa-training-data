Condensing Water Heaters
Air and Fuel Delivery
A motor-driven fan blows
combustion air through the
burner, which is often
mounted on top of the
storage tank.
Combustion Process
After ignition, the hot
combustion gases are forced
down through the central,
submerged combustion
chamber at high velocity into
the heat exchanger.
Heat Exchange
The heat exchanger consists
of a stainless helical coil of
tubing wound around the
exterior of the combustion
chamber. The swirling
motion induced by the heat
exchanger coil produces a
high rate of heat transfer.
Condensation and
Exhaust
The flue gases travel to the
base of the vessel where
they will condense as they
are exposed to the coolest
water in the tank. Flue gas
condensate is removed
through the condensate trap
and the products of
combustion exit through the
venting system.

Combination Systems
Heat Source
Water heater appliance provides hot
water for both domestic use and
space heating
Space Heating Unit
Water-to-air heat exchanger (fan
coil) transfers heat to air
Circulation
Pump circulates hot water through
the heat exchanger
Control Devices
Regulate water temperature and
system operation

Combination System Operation
Hot Water Production
Hot water from a storage-type heater
is circulated through a water-to-air
heat exchanger (fan coil).
Air Heating
A fan forces air across the heat
exchanger and through distribution
ducts to heat the building.
Water Recirculation
After passing through the heat
exchanger, the water is recirculated
back to the water heater for reheating.

Scalding Prevention
Scalding Risks
More than 90% of scalding incidents occur in the home.
Scalding injuries are tremendously painful, and the effects
can last for years. Water at temperatures above 106°F (41°C)
are painful. At a temperature of 131°F (55°C), a person can
be scalded with a third-degree burn in less than 4 seconds.
Legionella Concerns
If water is stored at 120°F (49°C) or lower, there is a danger
of the development and growth of Legionella bacteria,
which can cause serious health problems. To address both
safety concerns, water should be stored at 140°F (60°C) and
a thermostatic mixing device should be installed to temper
the distribution system to 120°F (49°C) or less.

Thermostatic Mixing Valves
Function
Three-port, automatic temperature-compensating valves
continuously sense the temperature of the water flowing
through their outlet.
Design
They have a cold inlet port, a hot inlet port and a mixed
outlet port.
Operation
When the outlet water temperature increases above set
limits, the valve opens to allow cold water to mix with the
hot water flow. When the temperature of the hot water is
reduced to safe levels, the cold port closes.

Thermostatic Gas Control Valve
Manual Gas Valve
Allows turning gas flow on or off
manually
Appliance Regulator
Maintains constant gas pressure
at the burner to control flow rate
Safety Shut-Off Valve
Prevents gas flow to the main
burner and pilot burner if the
pilot goes out
Pilot Adjustment
Manual valve for adjusting gas flow rate to the pilot
burner
Energy Cut-Off Device
Shuts off gas flow if water temperature becomes
excessively high

Rod and Tube Aquastat
Construction
The aquastat has a copper tube and invar rod assembly that
is immersed in the tank. The copper tube has a high
expansion and contraction rate, while the invar rod has a
very low expansion and contraction rate.
Operation
The rod and tube are connected together at the far end, and
expansion and contraction of the tube allow the invar rod to
control the movement of the control mechanism. Whenever
the temperature of the stored water drops a predetermined
amount, typically 15°F (8°C) to 20°F (11°C), the tube
contracts to turn on the gas flow to reheat the water to the
setpoint temperature.

Safety Devices
Thermal Cut-Off (TCO)
A high-limit switch set to a temperature above normal
operating temperature (typically 190°F/88°C). This type
of switch may or may not have a manual reset.
Energy Cut-Off Device (ECO)
A safety feature added to many rod and tube gas control
valves. If water temperature becomes excessively high,
the ECO will cut off gas flow to the burner. It's a fusible
link wired in series within the pilot safety circuit.
Flammable Vapour Sensor
Senses the presence of flammable vapours and prevents
the blower purge cycle from starting or continuing,
thereby preventing the operation of the igniter or the
continued operation of the gas valve.
Temperature and Pressure Relief Valve
Opens automatically to release water if the tank pressure
or water temperature becomes excessively high.

Flammable Vapour Ignition Resistance (FVIR)
Development
Background
In 1995, the Water Heater
Industry Joint Research and
Development Consortium was
formed to determine whether
a residential gas water heater
could be made more resistant
to accidents caused by
mishandling or improper
storage of gasoline or other
flammable materials.
Implementation
By July 2006, all gas water
heaters 75,000 Btuh or less
produced in the U.S. and
Canada were required to
comply with the new FVIR
standard.
Sensor Technology
The sensor technology is
comprised of three primary
components: silicone sensor
film, moulded base insert, and
moulded cover. When the
sensor senses flammable
vapour, silicone expands,
pulling some of the carbon
particles apart and increasing
the resistance of the sensor.
Safety Response
When these sensors have
locked out the ignition
sequence, there is usually an
error code visible at some point
on the water heater gas
control. Technicians must
typically contact the
manufacturer directly to
obtain the reactivation code.

FVIR Design Features
Air Intake Design
FVIR water heaters are designed to
seal off the combustion chamber
access doors and draw combustion air
for the burner from an 18 inch height
instead of floor level.
Flame Arrestor
Combustion air enters through the
one-way intake system and passes
through the flame arrestor plate
(usually stainless steel). If flammable
vapours are introduced and ignite, the
flames are contained within the
combustion chamber and cannot
escape back out of the heater.
Thermal Limit
The thermal limit or TCO shuts off gas
flow to the main and pilot burners
during flammable vapour ignition
inside the combustion chamber or if
excessive temperatures indicate poor
combustion due to a clogged screen
or filter.

Temperature and Pressure
Relief Valve
Temperature Sensing
The sensing stem of the relief valve extends down into the water within the
top 150 mm (6 inches) of the tank.
Pressure Relief
If the tank pressure becomes excessively high, the valve will open
automatically to release water.
Safety Warning
Never install any valve, cap, or plug on the outlet of a relief valve.
Replacement
Whenever a water heater is replaced, install a new valve and discard the
old one.

Water Heater Components
Dip Tube
The cold-water inlet is usually at the top
of the tank. A dip tube, which is usually
non-metallic, extends down into the
tank from the cold-water inlet. The dip
tube directs incoming cold water to the
lower part of the tank to ensure that the
hot water in the tank rises and leaves
the tank first.
Without the dip tube, the incoming cold
water would mix with the hot water in
the tank, resulting in the heater
delivering warm instead of hot water.
Anti-Siphon Hole
A small anti-siphon hole, located near
the top of the dip tube, prevents
siphoning action that could result from
the cold water supply being isolated. If
the cold water supply is shut off, the
tank will only siphon to the level of the
anti-siphon hole.
Anode Rod
Most storage-type water heaters are
equipped with an internal anode rod for
electrolytic corrosion protection. The
anode rod, which is usually made of
magnesium, will corrode before the
steel tank, thus extending the life of the
tank.

Venting Systems
Internal Flue
Most residential water heaters have an internal flue that
conducts the products of combustion to the venting system.
In a storage water heater, the flue is also part of the heat
exchange surface. The flue contains a spiral-shaped sheet-
metal baffle, which swirls the hot gases in the flue to
improve heat transfer to the water.
Flue Configurations
•Center-flue design (most common)
•Offset flue from the center of the tank
•External flue located adjacent to the outer wall of the
tank
•Floating-tank water heater with external flue that
completely encircles the tank
•High efficiency water heaters with multiple passes and
passages

Circulating Pumps
Domestic System Pumps
Pumps that are used to circulate
potable water must be suitable for
the application. Bronze body or
stainless pumps are the usual
choice to maintain quality of the
potable water.
In large domestic and commercial
systems, a pump may be used to
recirculate hot water continuously,
so it is immediately available at
maximum temperature, even at the
most distant points of the system.
Combination System Pumps
Room thermostats control
combination system pumps. On a
call for heat, the pump would be
activated and circulate water from
the water heater through the heat
transfer unit (like a fan coil).
Flow Sensors
Flow sensors and flow switches
detect fluid movement. In a water
heating system, a flow switch or
flow sensor can be used to ensure
that circulating pumps are
operating.

Water Heater Piping Layout
General Requirements
Gas supply and water piping installations for hot water
heaters must conform to manufacturer's specifications and
applicable Code requirements. Hot water piping runs should
be kept as short as possible to ensure minimum heat loss
and faster delivery of hot water to the point of use.
Residential Connections
Residential-type hot water heaters are generally fitted with
3/4 inch cold-water inlet and hot-water outlet galvanized
threaded piping connections. Metallic piping should be
connected to these tank nipples for a minimum distance of
450 mm (18 inches) to protect any plastic water distribution
piping within the system.
The cold-water inlet supply pipe must come with a shut-off
valve to isolate the water heater from the building water
supply when the heater requires maintenance, repair, or
replacement.

Multiple Water Heater Installations
Parallel Piping
When two water heaters are required, plumb them in a
manner that will assist in balancing the flow through each
unit. This parallel piping arrangement is sometimes referred
to as a cascade design.
Piping Drawings
Mechanical drawings for multiple gas-fired hot water heater
installations include component names, types, sizes, part
numbers, locations, configurations, and other data
necessary for installation purposes.
Piping sizes are specified on drawings to ensure that the
installation maintains proper flow rates and meet minimum
plumbing Code requirements when completed.

Relief Valve Discharge Line Requirements
Must Do
•Grade and install it to allow complete drainage of itself
and the relief valve
•Terminate in an air break at least 25 mm (1") in height, to
a maximum of 300 mm (12")
•Locate the end of the pipe so that any discharge is visible
•In the absence of a floor drain, the discharge line must
indirectly drain to the exterior of the building
•Weather-seal and mechanically protect all piping that
penetrates exterior walls
Must Not Do
•Make it smaller in size than the relief valve outlet
•Include valves or other restrictions
•Locate it in areas subject to freezing
•Thread or cap the end of the line
•Use steel or black iron pipe, as internal corrosion may
build up and block the discharge pipe

Hot Water Storage Systems
Large Tank Storage
Heaters
Larger water heaters for
commercial and industrial
applications often have
temperature sensed at more
than one level in the tank for
more accurate control.
Temperature control is
accomplished by means of a
diaphragm valve connected by
external bleed lines to the lower
and upper level control sensors.
Two-Tank Systems
Often used for applications that
require hot water at different
temperatures. For example, one
tank may supply water at 140°F
for kitchen and laundry use and
as preheated water for a second
tank. The second tank may
supply water at 180°F (82°C) for
dishwashing.
Circulating Water Heaters
In a circulation-type system,
water is heated in a small tank
and stored in another larger
tank. The water is circulated
through the heater by gravity or
by a circulating pump.

Tankless Water Heater Types
Indoor Power-
Vent
Uses a fan to push flue
gases to the outdoors.
Air needed for
combustion is taken
from the inside space
where the appliance is
located.
Indoor Direct-Vent
Combustion air is
supplied to the gas
burner directly from
the outdoors to the
appliance sealed
combustion chamber.
Two pipes, or one
concentric pipe, run
from the water heater
through the wall or roof
of the building.
Outdoor
These water heaters
receive combustion air
from their immediate
environment. Flue gas
is exhausted in the
same way.

Tankless Water Heater Venting
Venting Categories
Indoor units are typically listed as either Category 3 or
Category 4 appliances, with positive vent static pressure,
utilizing either stainless steel or plastic venting. These
appliance venting systems must be sized and installed
according to the manufacturer's literature.
Installation Guidelines
•The venting should be as direct as possible with a
minimum number of fittings
•The total developed length and number of fittings used
in an installation shall not exceed the requirements as
outlined by the appliance manufacturer's installation
instructions
•Terminations must be in accordance with the appliance
manufacturer's instructions, local building code
requirements, and CSA B149.1

Water Heater Removal
Procedure
Obtain Permits
Obtain the appropriate permits as required by local gas and plumbing
authorities.
Shut Down and Drain
Turn off the gas and cold water supply to the water heater. Open a nearby
hot water faucet and the water heater drain valve. If necessary, a hose may
be connected to the drain valve to direct the water to a drain.
Allow Cooling
Allow the heater to cool sufficiently for safe handling.
Disconnect and Remove
Disconnect the heater's gas supply piping. Disconnect the plumbing
piping when the heater has drained completely. Remove the heater
from the premises and prepare it for disposal.

Water Heater Installation Planning
Location Considerations
For a new installation, plan the
location carefully to ensure there
will be adequate combustion air
supply, proper venting action, and
effective relief valve drainage.
Unless a water heater is of the
direct-vent type, it shall not be
installed in a bedroom, bathroom,
or any area where sleeping
accommodation is provided.
Clearances
Installation clearances at the rear
and sides of an underfired storage-
type water heater must be no less
than 2 inches (50 mm). Ample
clearance must also be provided at
the front of the unit for lighting,
servicing, cleaning, and adjustment.
Combustion Air
The area selected must have
adequate ventilation, as the burner
will consume oxygen during water
heater operation. If the water
heater is installed in an enclosed
area, ventilation openings or an air
inlet must be provided in
accordance with the applicable
Code requirements.

Venting Requirements
Single-wall type vent6 inches (150 mm) clearance
from combustible surfaces
Type B vent1 inch (25 mm) clearance from
combustible surfaces
Type BH vent (special venting
system)
Consult venting manufacturer
Sides of the water heaterAt least 2 inches (50 mm)
clearance

Water Heater Installation - Drainage
Drainage Requirements
A water heater should not be installed in a location where
water damage can result from water heater leakage (this is
particularly important in multi-storey buildings). In such
cases, the installation must include a means of directing
leakage or overflow to a suitable drain, i.e., a pan installed
under the tank and piped to a suitable location.
Drain Pan Specifications
The National Plumbing Code requires that drain pans be
installed for all water heaters when they may cause damage
to wood construction or are located in a ceiling or roof
space. The drain pan must be at least 50 mm larger than the
tank's diameter and have walls a minimum of 25 mm high. It
must have a drain that is a minimum 2 sizes larger than the
relief valve's discharge pipe.

Water Piping Installation
Preparation
Level the water heater before
proceeding with the piping
installation. Close the main
water supply shut-off valve.
Release water pressure and
drain piping by opening
nearby hot and cold water
faucets. Close the water
faucets after the system is
completely drained.
Fitting Installation
Install the necessary fittings
to connect the cold and hot
water supply to the heater.
Markings on the heater
identify inlet and outlet
connections. Check that the
cold-water inlet connection
contains the factory furnished
dip tube.
Connection Guidelines
Do not solder the cold water
supply pipe directly to the
cold-water inlet connection. If
required, solder the tubing to
an appropriate adapter before
attaching the adapter to the
cold-water inlet. The cold-
water inlet line must contain a
shut-off valve and a union
should be provided.
Vacuum Relief
The National Plumbing Code
requires the installation of a
vacuum relief valve in the cold
water supply line between the
shut-off valve and the cold-
water inlet to the tank. In the
case of depressurization in
the supply line, the valve will
prevent a vacuum from
imploding the tank.

Gas Piping Installation
Code Compliance
Consult CSA B149.1 for the type and size of pipe to use. The rating plate on the heater indicates the type of gas and maximum rated
input of the unit.
Preparation
Turn off the gas supply. Remove burrs, oil, pipe compound, and other contamination from the pipe or tubing. Ensure that the
interior of the piping is clean. Foreign material left in gas piping can work its way to the gas control valve and damage the
components.
Installation
Cut the piping in accordance with good piping practices. Ensure that all connections are gas-tight. Avoid stressing the gas control
valve when attaching the supply pipe by supporting the control valve with a wrench.
Testing
Slowly open the gas shut-off valve and carefully check all gas piping, including factory piping, for leaks. Use an appropriate liquid
solution or a leak-detection device.

Filling the Water Heater
Close Drain Valve
Close the heater drain valve.
Open Water Supply
Open the cold water supply valve.
Purge Air
Open a nearby hot water faucet (remove the faucet aerator to
avoid clogging it with debris). This will assist filling by allowing the
air in the heater and piping to escape. When a steady stream of
water flows from the open faucet, the tank is full.
Check for Leaks
Close the hot water faucet. Replace the aerator. Check all water
piping and plumbing fitting connections for leaks, and repair as
necessary.

Gas Leak Check
Turn On Gas
Turn on the main gas supply. Relight the pilot burners of any other gas
appliances with standing pilots. Turn on the gas shut-off valve in the
water heater gas supply pipe.
Safety Precautions
Do not light the pilot burner (if applicable). Do not use a match or open
flame to test for gas leaks.
Leak Testing
Use a liquid solution (like soapy water) or a leak detection device to test
for leaks. Apply the soap mixture to all gas pipe joints and fittings.
Inspection
Observe connection joints for the presence of soap bubbles, which will
indicate leaks. Repair leaks as necessary and ensure that the installation is
left in a safe condition.

General Installation Check
1
Clearance Check
Check to ensure there is at least 2 inches of clearance
between the water heater and combustible materials.
2
Leak Inspection
Ensure that there is no water leakage.
3
Ventilation Verification
Confirm there is adequate ventilation around the
heater area.
4
Water Fill Confirmation
Verify the heater is completely filled with water and
that all air has been expelled from the system.
5
Gas Piping Compliance
Ensure the gas piping conforms with applicable
Codes.
6
Venting Installation
Confirm the draft hood and vent pipe are installed
properly.

Lighting the Pilot Burner
Turn Off Pilot
Turn the PILOT ON-OFF dial on the thermostat control valve to the OFF
position. Wait five minutes when relighting.
Prepare for Lighting
Turn the PILOT ON-OFF dial on the thermostat control valve to the
PILOT position.
Light the Pilot
Apply an open flame to the pilot burner opening and depress the
PILOT RESET button for approximately one minute or until the
burner flame remains constant upon release of the RESET button.
Complete Setup
Turn the PILOT ON-OFF dial on the thermostat control valve to
the ON position. Adjust the thermostat temperature selector
dial to the desired temperature.

Legionella Prevention
What is Legionella?
Legionella is a fairly common water bacteria found to exist
widely in many surface water sources such as lakes, rivers,
streams and ponds. It can also be found in groundwater
sources and some soils. At the levels found in these naturally
occurring sources, it typically does not pose a threat to
public health.
Ideal Growth Conditions
When the bacterium enters a domestic water system, it can
find an ideal host environment in the following conditions,
where it can rapidly colonize, forming higher concentrations
that can pose the public health threat of Legionnaires
Disease:
•Warm water temperatures 104-115°F (40-46°C)
•Stagnant water areas (storage tanks and dead-end
piping legs)
•Ample food sources (sediment, scale, deposits and
biofilm)

Legionella Control Methods
Temperature Control
Maintain hot water system storage temperature at or above 140°F (60°C)
Prevent Stagnation
Eliminate dead legs and ensure proper circulation
Reduce Food Sources
Regular cleaning to remove sediment and biofilm
4
Anti-Scald Protection
Use thermostatic mixing valves to prevent scalding

Thermal Expansion Protection
Code Requirement
The National Plumbing Code requires protection against
thermal expansion for closed water distribution systems to
accommodate the increase in pressure from water
expansion when heated.
Solutions
•Diaphragm expansion tank (rated for use with potable
water)
•Auxiliary thermal expansion relief valve (TER Valve)
These devices prevent excessive pressure buildup in the
water heater tank and distribution system, which could
potentially damage components or cause the temperature
and pressure relief valve to discharge.

Plastic Piping Considerations
Manufacturer Recommendations
If plastic piping is used for the construction of the water
distribution system, the manufacturers recommend to not
connect to within 18 inches (450 mm) of the water heater
with these products.
Best Practice
It is good plumbing practice to use a minimum of 18 inches
(450 mm) of metallic piping to connect the heater to the
water distribution system. This helps protect plastic piping
from the high temperatures that can occur near the water
heater connections.

Temperature Stratification
What is Temperature Stratification?
The water at the top of tank-type water heaters reaches a
higher temperature than the water at the bottom during
those periods when the hot water is not being drawn off.
This temperature difference is called "temperature
stratification".
Influencing Factors
•The shape of the tank - taller tanks influence
stratification
•The length of the dip tube - a shorter dip tube would
allow too much mixing to occur
Proper stratification helps ensure that the hottest water is
available at the outlet, improving the efficiency and
performance of the water heater.

Flue Baffle Function
Purpose
In a storage water heater, the flue is part of the heat
exchange surface. The flue contains a spiral-shaped sheet-
metal baffle, which swirls the hot gases in the flue to
improve heat transfer to the water.
Benefits
•Increases the time hot gases remain in contact with the
flue surface
•Creates turbulence in the flue gas flow, enhancing heat
transfer
•Improves overall efficiency of the water heater
•Reduces the temperature of the flue gases exiting the
water heater

Direct-Vent Water Heater
Advantages
Location Flexibility
Can be installed in bedrooms, bathrooms, or any enclosure where sleeping
accommodation is provided, unlike conventional water heaters.
Combustion Air Quality
Draws combustion air directly from outside, ensuring clean air for combustion regardless of
indoor air quality.
Safety
Sealed combustion system prevents products of combustion from entering the living
space and is not affected by negative pressure conditions in the building.
Efficiency
Often more efficient than conventional water heaters because they're not affected by
drafts or indoor air temperature fluctuations.

FVIR Sensor Technology
Sensor Components
The sensor technology is comprised of three primary
components:
•Silicone sensor film
•Moulded base insert
•Moulded cover
Operation
When the sensor senses flammable vapour, silicone
expands, pulling some of the carbon particles apart and
increasing the resistance of the sensor. The magnitude of
the increase in resistance depends upon the gasoline vapour
concentration - higher concentrations cause increased
expansion of the silicone film, which results in a higher
sensor resistance and vice versa.

Vacuum Relief Valve Importance
Purpose
The National Plumbing Code requires that a vacuum relief
valve be installed when any tank may be subject to back-
siphonage. Note that most storage tanks can be subject to
pressures less than atmospheric when there is a reduction or
interruption in service pressure.
Installation
This valve must be installed downstream of the tank shut-
off valve and should not have a means to prevent it from
supervising the pressure in the tank. The vacuum relief valve
protects the tank from implosion due to negative pressure,
which may occur within the tank.

Drain Pan Requirements
50
Millimeters

relief valve's discharge pipe
The National Plumbing Code requires drain pans for all water heaters when they may
cause damage to wood construction or are located in a ceiling or roof space. The
drain pan must be properly sized and have an adequate drain to prevent water
damage in case of leaks or relief valve discharge.

Water Heater Maintenance Importance
Regular Inspection
Periodic inspection of water
heaters helps identify potential
issues before they become major
problems.
Anode Rod Replacement
The anode rod should be
checked regularly and replaced
when significantly corroded to
extend the life of the tank.
Sediment Removal
Regular flushing of the tank
helps remove sediment buildup
that can reduce efficiency and
cause premature failure.
Temperature Setting
Periodically check and adjust the temperature setting
to ensure it meets both safety requirements and
household needs.
Relief Valve Testing
The temperature and pressure relief valve should be
tested periodically to ensure it will function properly in
an emergency.

Combination Systems for
Heating and Hot Water
Most occupied buildings have a supply of domestic hot water and
equipment for central heating. Combining the two systems is sometimes
the most economical and efficient way to provide both services. Because
the popularity of this type of system is increasing, the gas
technician/fitter must be able to identify, select, and install components
and controls that will ensure both the domestic hot water and space
heating requirements of the system are met.

Compliance Requirements
It is the responsibility of the gas technician/fitter to comply with all
codes, as well as their local trade regulations. In most jurisdictions
within Canada, the only individual permitted to perform installation,
alteration, or repair on any part of a plumbing system is a licensed Red
Seal Plumber or Registered Plumbing Apprentice.

Design Requirements for
Combination Systems
1
System Connections
Existing non-potable hydronic systems, or parts taken from or connected to these
systems, must not be connected to potable water combination systems.
2
Chemical Additives
No chemicals, such as those used in a typical boiler-heated system, may be added to
the combination system.
3
System Drainage
Provision must be made to allow the entire combination system to be drained.
4
System Testing
Only potable water may be used to test the combination system, and the system
must be flushed before being put into service.

Installation and Access Requirements
Component Access
All components of the combination system
must be installed with provision for ready
access for inspection, maintenance, repair,
and cleaning, in accordance with the
manufacturer's operation and maintenance
instructions.

CSA Combo Performance Specification
CSA P.9 Standard
CSA Combo Performance Specification
Summary (refer to CAN/CSA P.9)
applies to forced-air combo heating
systems. This Standard allows
mechanical designers to select and
specify an efficiently and appropriately
sized combination system.
Designer Resources
The standard provides the installer with
a table of requirements and selected
system ratings and the manufacturer's
P.9 performance summary and system
schematic.
Efficiency Ratings
It is important to use the CAN/CSA P.9
efficiency ratings as simply knowing the
efficiency of a water heater in water
heating mode only does not provide
useful information on the efficiency of a
combination system in space heating
mode.

Thermal Performance Factor (TPF)
Building Code Requirements
The National Building Code of Canada (and some provincial building codes) recently set a minimum requirement
for systems using the CAN/CSA P.9 Thermal Performance Factor (TPF).
TPF defines the gas-use efficiency based on both space and water heating test ratings. Higher values equate to
higher efficiency and lower energy costs.
Minimum Requirements
The minimum acceptable TPF may be set by the building code or in relation to any high-performance housing
program that the owner or builder plans to enroll the home with.
For example, ENERGY STAR® for new homes standard identifies that a water heater be of the condensing type
and that the heater has undergone testing according to the procedures outlined in CAN/CSA P.9 in order to meet
their requirements.

Functions of Combination
Systems
2
Primary Functions
Combination systems perform two functions: space heating and domestic
water heating.
4
Component Categories
The components of combination systems are grouped into four main
categories: heat sources, space heating units, circulating equipment, and
control devices.

System Certification
Requirements
Certification Marking
Systems and water heaters
should be identified and
certified as suitable for
combination heating systems.
Proper Labeling
Equipment must be labeled
"Suitable for water (potable)
and space heating."
Approved Components
All components must be approved for the specific application for
which they are used.

Principles of Operation
Hot Water Source
Hot water is drawn from a gas-fired
storage-type water heater
Circulation
Water is circulated through a water-
to-air heat exchanger (fan-coil)
Heat Distribution
A fan forces the warm air from the
heat exchanger through distribution
ductwork
Return Circulation
After passing through the heat
exchanger, the hot water is re-
circulated back to the water heater

Water Heater Types for Combination Systems
Storage-Type Water Heaters
A direct-fired combination system may have a standard, storage-type water heater that provides
both domestic hot water and water for space heating.
Tankless Water Heaters
Systems equipped with tankless water heaters may also include an additional hot water storage
tank to ensure adequate supply for both domestic use and space heating demands.

Types of Combination Heating Systems
Open System
According to CSA B214, an open system is a piping system conveying potable water or a hydronic solution that is open at any
point to atmosphere.
Any properly installed hydronic space heating system that circulates water for the purposes of heat transfer that may exit at
some point through a faucet or other potable system outlet, and/or has another opening to atmosphere at some point, is
considered an "open system".
Closed-Loop System
A closed system is a piping system that is sealed at all points from the atmosphere and contains a non-potable solution.
For a system to be considered a "closed system", there must be no contact to atmosphere at any point. This includes complete
separation of the space heating fluid from the domestic water system using a hydronic (water-to-water) heat exchanger.

Heat Exchanger Requirements for Closed Systems
Double-Walled Heat Exchangers
In some cases, a double-walled heat exchanger (with or
without a vented leak path) may be required to reduce the
possibility of cross-contamination of the potable supply.
Local Jurisdiction Requirements
Check with local jurisdiction for more information regarding
backflow prevention in your area.
System Classification Note
This is not to be confused with an open expansion tank vs. a
closed expansion tank. For example, if you have a closed-
style expansion device, however, your system heat transfer
fluid communicates directly with the potable water system,
you have an open-loop system.
Potable Water Status
A closed-loop system does not maintain its heat transfer
fluid in a potable state.

Applications for Combination
Systems
Single-Family Residential
Installations
Combination forced air and hot
water heating systems provide
design flexibility and can be
adapted to many different
applications, including single-
family homes.
Add-On Unit Installations
These systems can be used to
supplement existing heating
systems, providing additional
heating capacity or efficiency.
Important Considerations
Careful adherence to trade regulations and proper design/installation that
maintains the integrity of the potable water system is paramount in part
because of the liability associated with an improperly installed and/or
maintained system.

Understanding System
Fundamentals
Service Knowledge
It is important for a gas
fitter/technician to recognize and
understand the fundamentals of
operation for these systems in
order to properly service the
associated gas-fired appliance.
System Types
The combination systems
discussed in Unit 18 Water heaters
and combination systems consists
mostly of direct-fired domestic
water heaters and packaged air-
handling units.
Advanced Systems
Other types of combination systems include indirect-fired water heaters,
boilers, radiant heating units, and other components, which are covered in
detail in Unit 20 Hydronic heating systems.

Temperature and Pressure Relief Valve
Code Requirement
Installation of a correctly sized water heater temperature and pressure relief valve (T&P) is a Code
requirement for all plumbing systems, regardless of whether an additional lower pressure relief
valve is installed.
Safety Function
The temperature and pressure relief valve opens to safely discharge fluid from the system before
excessive pressures can develop.
This is a critical safety component that protects against dangerous pressure buildup that could
lead to equipment damage or personal injury.

Expansion Tank Purpose and Function
Thermal Expansion Control
The fluid expands when it undergoes heating. The pressure that the expanding fluid
creates in a heating system requires control to prevent it from reaching dangerous levels.
A diaphragm-type expansion tank helps contain the increased volume of fluid within the
system, as explained below.
How It Works
•The internal diaphragm in this type of expansion tank divides the tank into two
chambers.
•The chamber below the diaphragm contains a volume of compressed air that has
been pre-pressurized by the manufacturer of the tank (this must be adjusted to
match the system design pressure).
•The chamber above the diaphragm accommodates the expanded volume of heated
system fluid.
•Fluid entering the tank causes the diaphragm to flex, further compressing the air
volume in the lower chamber.
•When the total volume of fluid in the system is reduced because of cooling, the fluid
in the expansion tank is forced back into the system by the pressure exerted on the
diaphragm by the compressed air in the lower chamber.

Check Valves in Combination Systems
Purpose of Check Valves
Check valves prevent reverse flow. They should not be confused with (or substituted
for) approved backflow prevention assemblies as they are neither designed nor
approved for cross contamination prevention.
Backflow prevention assemblies are more elaborate in their design and often require
annual testing and maintenance.
Swing Check Valve
The most common type of check valve in use is the swing check valve. This type of
valve has a hinged disc that swings open to allow fluid flow in the desired direction. A
swing check valve works best in the upright horizontal position only.
A vertical check valve is commonly called a lift check.
Other types of check valves may incorporate a spring and can be installed in any
position. When the fluid flow reverses direction, the disc closes onto the valve seat
preventing the fluid from flowing backwards in the system.

Vacuum Relief Valves
Function and Purpose
Vacuum relief valves are normally open valves installed on cold-water inlet lines to storage tanks. They are not a
backflow device - their purpose is to allow air to enter the water system to prevent negative pressure from
developing in the water heater storage tank.
Any vacuum created in the system opens the vacuum relief valve to draw in outside air to maintain the balance of
pressure in the system.
Importance for Water Temperature
At atmospheric pressure water boils at 212°F (100°C). If the pressure is lower than atmospheric pressure
(vacuum), it will boil and change state to steam at a lower temperature.
This is why maintaining proper pressure in the system is critical for safe operation and preventing premature
water state changes that could damage equipment or create unsafe conditions.

Mixing Valves for Temperature
Control
Purpose
Some systems may require hot water for domestic use to be delivered at a lower
temperature than when it comes from the water heater.
Function
A thermostatic mixing valve is used to blend cold water with the hot water from the tank to
achieve the lower temperature.
Safety Benefit
This helps prevent scalding while allowing the water heater to operate at higher
temperatures for effective space heating.
Code Compliance
If hot water is produced at higher than 140°F (60°C), a mixing valve conforming to CSA
Standard B125.3 is required to supply domestic hot water at 140°F (60°C).

Circulating Pumps in Hydronic Systems
Purpose and Type
A circulating pump (circulator) is used to move the fluid through a
hydronic system. A centrifugal-type pump is most commonly used
as the circulator in a hydronic system.
Pump Control Options
A circulation pump control may be a simple on-off switch, when
required for a domestic hot water recirculating system, or a relay-
type device.
The pump control works as follows:
1.On a call for heat, the thermostat contacts close, energizing the
coil of the 24 V relay. The normally open contacts of the relay
then close to complete the 110 V pump operating circuit.
2.When the desired temperature is reached, the thermostat
contacts open, the relay contacts open, and the pump stops
operating.

Additional Requirements for
Combination Systems
No Chemical Additives
No chemical additives must be used in the system.
No Boiler Replacement
No water heater must be used to replace an existing boiler.
Water Conditioning
Water conditioning may be required in hard water areas.
Backflow Prevention
A backflow preventer is required wherever the potential for cross-
contamination of potable and non-potable systems exists.

Vacuum Relief Valve
Installation Note
Qualified Installation
A qualified installer/tester
must install a typical vacuum
relief valve and ensure that
provisions to alleviate the
potential for bacterial growth
within a potable water system.
Proper Placement
Vacuum relief valves must be
installed in the correct location
to function properly and
provide system protection.
Regular Maintenance
Like all safety devices, vacuum relief valves should be inspected
regularly to ensure proper operation.

Condensing combination systems offer the highest energy efficiency at 95%, significantly outperforming standard water heaters which operate at around 65% efficiency. High-efficiency water heaters achieve
approximately 82% efficiency, while tankless combination systems reach about 88% efficiency. These efficiency ratings are important considerations when selecting a system that will provide both space heating
and domestic hot water.

Combination System Applications
Residential Applications
Combination systems are ideal for single-family homes and small multi-family buildings where space is limited and efficiency is desired. They provide both
domestic hot water and space heating from a single appliance, reducing mechanical room footprint.
Light Commercial Applications
Small offices, retail spaces, and other light commercial buildings can benefit from combination systems, especially when hot water demands are moderate and
space heating is required. These systems can be more cost-effective than separate appliances for each function.
Renovation Projects
When upgrading existing buildings, combination systems can provide an efficient solution that requires less space than separate systems. They're particularly
valuable in retrofit situations where mechanical room space is limited.

Systems
Gas technicians do not design potable water systems as this work is
typically done by plumbers. However, when sizing domestic hot water
heaters and allowing for combination system requirements, the gas

Water Heater Sizing Basics
Basic Guide
The sizing information provided is a basic guide to water heater sizing for
combination potable water heating and space heating applications.
Be aware that each building's domestic hot water requirements vary. Proper
water heater sizing must consider two factors:
•The capacity of the water heater in gallons
•The Btu input of the water heater
Water heater sizing is critical to ensure adequate hot water supply for both
domestic use and space heating in combination systems.

Determining Water Heater Capacity
The following water heater sizing criteria are taken from a manufacturer's installation guide. The use of a minimum 40 imperial
gallon/48 USG (180 L), high-recovery and/or high-efficiency gas-fired water heater is recommended.
Air handlerMinimum water heater capacity
600 cfm (280 L/s) to 800 cfm (380 L/s)40 imp. gallon/48 USG (180 L)
1000 cfm (470 L/s) to 1200 cfm (570 L/s)50 imp. gallon/60 USG (225 L)

USG (341 L)
2000 cfm (940 L/s)Any combination of water heaters having at least 105,000
Btu/h (30.8 kW) output

Determining Water Heater Input
Required Calculation Factors
The required water heater input calculation is based on the:
•Calculated heat loss of the building in which the system is to be
installed
•Water heater recovery efficiency rating
Perform the heat loss calculation in accordance with approved
industry engineering practices. The importance of this step cannot
be understated.
Climate Considerations
Local climate and temperature variations have an effect on
building heat loss and will therefore also influence input
calculations.
For example, a water heater installed in an area that has long, cold
winters would require more energy to produce a given amount of
heat than one installed in a milder climate. For this reason, a
multiplication factor reflecting local climatic conditions must be
factored into the calculation.
Always consult local information sources to ensure that your
calculations include the proper climate multiplication factors. The
two examples shown below are for reference only.
•For mild climates, Input = calculated heat loss x 1.51
•For colder climates, Input = calculated heat loss x 1.58

Space Heating Requirements
Minimum Capacity Requirements
The minimum capacity of an appliance or the portion of its total capacity used
for space heating must be based on the calculated heat loss of the building.
Where an air handler is used as the only source of heat, it should be sized
accordingly.
Design and Installation Standards
The design and installation of the system must be in accordance with approved
industry engineering practices or manuals published by one of the following
organizations or an equivalent:
•Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Institute of Canada (HRAI)
•American Society of Heating Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers
(ASHRAE)
•Air Conditioning Contractors of America (ACCA)

Air Handler Selection

practices or publication from one of these organizations or an equivalent.

Combination Space and Domestic Hot Water Heating
Capacity Calculation
The capacities of combination hot water tank (HWT) and fan coil heating units can be calculated
in accordance with the Combo System HWT/Fan Coil Sizing design worksheet. The design and
installation of the system must be according to approved industry engineering practices.
The design worksheet provides a convenient way to size the system. The designer may use the
basic drawings provided in approved publications to show the basic principles of the proposed
combination system. Other accessories or components may be required in accordance with local
codes.
A properly sized combination system ensures adequate hot water for both domestic use and
space heating requirements.

CSA B149.1 Stipulations for Combo Heating
Systems
Section 7.27.6
Except for direct-vent water heaters, when the water
heater is used in a combo heating system, return-air
inlets shall not be installed in the same enclosure that
contains both an air-handling unit and the water heater.
Adequate combustion air shall be provided for the water
heater.
Section 7.27.7
When the return air duct(s) of an air handling unit in a
combo heating system is installed in an enclosure in
which any spillage-susceptible appliances are located, it
shall be sealed to the air handling unit casing, and joints in
the ducting shall be sealed to prevent infiltration of air
from the enclosure into the return-air ducting.

Combo System HWT/Fan-Coil Sizing Design
Worksheet
The Combo System HWT/Fan-Coil Sizing design worksheet provides a structured approach to calculating the requirements
for combination systems. It includes sections for fan coil specifications, domestic demand calculations, combo water heater
sizing, and available BTU for fan coil use.
This worksheet helps ensure that all critical factors are considered when sizing a combination system, including heated area,
heating demand, domestic hot water requirements, and water heater specifications.

Fan-Coil Water Heater Types
Storage-Type Water Heater
A conventional water heater with a tank that stores hot
water for both domestic use and space heating. These
systems maintain a reserve of hot water that can be used for
both purposes.
•Provides consistent hot water supply
•Can handle simultaneous demands
•Takes up more space
Tankless Water Heater
A system that heats water on demand without storing it in a
tank. These systems can provide hot water for both
domestic use and space heating as needed.
•More energy efficient
•Takes up less space
•May have limitations during peak demand

Combination System with
Storage-Type Water Heater
The diagram shows a typical configuration for a combination fan-coil unit
with a storage-type water heater. This system uses a conventional water
heater to provide hot water for both domestic use and space heating
through a fan-coil unit.
The storage-type water heater maintains a reserve of hot water that can
be used for both domestic purposes and space heating, providing a
reliable source of heat for the fan-coil unit.

Combination System Sample Calculation
Dwelling Specifications
The following combination system sample calculation is
based on a dwelling with:
•Two bedrooms
•Two bathrooms
•21,000 Btu/h heat loss
The example is based on typical domestic hot water usage
rates. If the dwelling has additional hot water requirements
(such as a hot tub), the system must be designed to meet
those additional requirements.
Water Heater Specifications
SpecificationRequirement
Storage capacity50 gallons (225 L)
Input50,000 Btu/h (15 kW)
Recovery efficiency76%
Output38,000 Btu/h (11 kW)

Sample Calculation Results
Using the Combo System Sizing Worksheet, the designed domestic draw
of 60 gal (273 L) is satisfied by the selected conventional combination
hot water heater with 29,700 Btu/h (8.7 kW) available for the fan coil to
satisfy the 24,150 Btu/h (7.1 kW) space heat loss requirement.
This calculation demonstrates how to properly size a combination
system to meet both domestic hot water needs and space heating
requirements. The worksheet helps ensure that the selected water
heater has sufficient capacity for both purposes.

Pump Sizing Overview
Circulation Pump Requirements
Most combination systems require a circulation pump to move water
through the system. The installation of circulation pumps must be in
accordance with the applicable Codes and the air handler
manufacturer's installation instructions.
Circulation pumps used in combination systems should be stainless or
bronze body centrifugal-type pumps designed for use in hydronic
heating systems and sized to meet the requirements of the system.
Proper pump sizing is essential for ensuring efficient operation of
combination water heating and space heating systems.

Key Factors in Pump Selection
Flow Rate
The amount of water to be circulated
through the system
Pressure Loss
Resistance due to friction that the
pump must overcome
Performance Curve
Manufacturer's data showing
relationship between flow rate and
pressure loss
Selection
Choose pump based on system
requirements and performance data
After determining the system flow rate and pressure loss, you can use the manufacturer's pump performance curve data to
select the proper circulator for the application. A pump performance curve shows the relationship between flow rate and
pressure loss.

Circulation Pump Sizing Rule-of-Thumb
Flow Rate Calculation
Flow rate of the pump should be 1 US gallon per minute
(USGPM) per 10,000 Btu/h heat output required
Friction Pressure Loss
Allow 1 ft of friction pressure loss per 40 ft of pipe run
This rule-of-thumb provides a quick method for estimating the required pump size for a hydronic heating system. More
detailed calculations may be necessary for complex systems or those with special requirements.

Understanding Flow Rate
Definition
The flow rate is the amount of water to be circulated
through the system. It is traditionally measured in US gallons
per minute (USGPM).
Determining Factors
Flow rate is determined by:
•The amount of heat to be supplied
•The difference in temperature between the water leaving
the heater
•The temperature of the water that returns to the heater
after giving up its heat
The amount of heat to be supplied is the Btu/h output
determined by a heat loss calculation for the building.

Understanding Pressure Loss
Friction Resistance
Water flowing through pipes encounters resistance due to friction
Pump Requirements
Pump must overcome this resistance to maintain flow
Calculation
Based on flow rate, pipe size, and run length
Measurement
Typically measured in feet of head water column (ft. hd.
w.c.)

Pump Curve Charts
In order to select the appropriate pump for a given installation, you must
know how much pressure a pump will develop for a given gallon per
minute (gpm) flow rate. This information can be found on
manufacturers' pump curve charts.
Each pump will have its own pump curve, although more than one pump
model may appear on a single chart. Pump models A through H shown in
the example are from one pump manufacturer.

typically shows the head in feet of
water column. This represents the
pressure that the pump can develop at
different flow rates.
Horizontal Axis (Flow Rate)
The horizontal axis shows the flow
rate in gallons per minute (gpm). This
represents how much water the pump
can move at different pressure levels.
Curve Interpretation
Each curve on the chart represents a
specific pump model or speed setting.
The point where your system's
required flow rate and pressure loss
intersect on the chart helps identify
the appropriate pump for your
application.

Multiple Speed Pump
Options
Speed Selection
Most manufacturers offer
circulators capable of
operating at three different
speeds
Speed Control
The desired speed is
selected using an external
switch on the circulator's
junction box
Performance Curves
Each operating speed has a corresponding pump curve
To reduce the number of circulator models needed and still cover a wide
range of performance requirements, manufacturers typically offer multi-
speed options. This allows for flexibility in matching the pump to the
specific system requirements.

Importance of Proper Water Heater Sizing
System Efficiency
Optimizes energy usage and reduces operating costs
Adequate Hot Water Supply
Ensures sufficient hot water for both domestic use and space heating
Occupant Comfort
Maintains consistent temperatures and hot water availability
Cost-Effective Installation
Prevents over-sizing and unnecessary equipment expenses

Heat Loss Calculation Importance
Foundation of System Sizing
The heat loss calculation forms the
basis for determining the required
capacity of both the water heater and
the space heating components.
Perform the heat loss calculation in
accordance with approved industry
engineering practices.
Accuracy is Critical
An accurate heat loss calculation
ensures that the system is neither
undersized (leading to inadequate
heating) nor oversized (resulting in
inefficient operation and unnecessary
costs). The importance of this step
cannot be understated.
Climate Considerations
Local climate and temperature variations have a significant effect on building heat
loss and will therefore influence input calculations. Always consult local information
sources to ensure that your calculations include the proper climate multiplication
factors.

Climate Multiplication Factors
Purpose
Climate multiplication factors adjust the heat loss
calculations to account for local weather conditions. These
factors ensure that the water heater and space heating
system have sufficient capacity to meet demands during
peak cold periods.
Example Factors
The following examples are provided for reference only:
•For mild climates: Input = calculated heat loss x 1.51
•For colder climates: Input = calculated heat loss x 1.58
Always consult local information sources to ensure that your
calculations include the proper climate multiplication
factors for your specific region.

Air Handler Selection Criteria
Calculate Building
Heat Loss
Determine the total heat loss
for the building using
approved calculation
methods from organizations
like HRAI, ASHRAE, or
ACCA.
Select Air Handler with
Adequate Heating
Output
Choose an air handler with a
heating output that exceeds
the calculated space heating
loss of the building to ensure
sufficient heating capacity.
Match Cooling Coil to
Outdoor Unit
Ensure that the cooling coil
in the air handler is sized to
match the outdoor
condensing unit for proper
cooling operation.
Consider Water
Heater Capacity
Remember that the heating
output of the air handler will
be limited by the water
heater capacity. If the water
heater is undersized, the
heating capacity of the air
handler will be less than its
rated output.

Minimum Water Heater Capacities Table
Table 5 HUD-FHA Minimum Water Heater Capacities for One- and Two-family Living Units provides guidance on the
minimum required water heater specifications based on the number of bathrooms and bedrooms in a dwelling.
This table helps ensure that the water heater has sufficient capacity to meet the domestic hot water needs of the household,
with specifications for storage capacity, BTU/h input, 1-hour draw capacity, and recovery rate.

The sample calculation demonstrates how to determine the appropriate water heater and fan coil specifications for a typical residential application with
standard domestic hot water usage patterns.

Water Heater Specifications for Sample Calculation
The water heater specifications for the sample calculation include a 50-gallon storage capacity, 50,000 Btu/h input, 76% recovery efficiency, and 38,000 Btu/h output. These specifications ensure that
the water heater can meet both the domestic hot water needs and space heating requirements of the dwelling.

Calculation Results for Sample System
Domestic Hot Water Requirements
The designed domestic draw of 60 gallons (273 L) is
satisfied by the selected conventional combination hot
water heater. This ensures that the system can meet the
household's hot water needs for bathing, washing, and other
domestic purposes.
Space Heating Requirements
The selected water heater provides 29,700 Btu/h (8.7 kW)
available for the fan coil, which is sufficient to satisfy the
24,150 Btu/h (7.1 kW) space heat loss requirement. This
ensures that the system can maintain comfortable indoor
temperatures during cold weather.

pipe run, or consult friction loss tables for more precise
calculations.
Determine Total Pressure Loss
Add up all sources of pressure loss in the system, including pipe
friction, fittings, valves, and heat exchange equipment.

Sample Pump Curve Chart
Analysis
The sample pump curve chart shows multiple pump models (labeled A
through H) from a single manufacturer. Each curve represents the
performance characteristics of a specific pump model, showing the
relationship between flow rate (horizontal axis, measured in gallons per
minute) and head pressure (vertical axis, measured in feet of head water
column).
To select the appropriate pump, identify the point where your system's
required flow rate and pressure loss intersect on the chart, then choose
the pump model whose curve passes through or just above that point.

Servicing Systems for Water
Heaters and Combination
Systems
An important part of a gas technician's/fitter's duties is to solve safely,
accurately, and efficiently the technical problems associated with hot
water heating and combination systems. The gas technician/fitter must
know how to troubleshoot and service electrical and non-electrical
systems and components and analyze and correct problems that result
from water conditions and improper combustion.

Temperature and Pressure
Relief Valve
Definition
A valve that automatically opens
a relief vent when either the
pressure or temperature reaches
a predetermined value and
reseats again when the pressure
or temperature returns to
normal.
Purpose
Provides critical safety
protection by preventing
excessive pressure or
temperature buildup in the water
heater tank.
Operation
Opens automatically when pressure exceeds rating or temperature
exceeds 210°F, then reseats when conditions normalize.

Electrical Components
Troubleshooting
Standing Pilot Issues
If the water heater comes with a standing pilot and there is no hot water,
check if the pilot burner is out.
Loose Thermocouple Connection
Tighten the thermocouple connection to the control unit a 1/4 turn past
hand tight.
Defective Thermocouple
Check for broken or cracked terminals and ensure threads are in good
order.
Defective Pilot Magnet
Test the pilotstat coil for proper operation.

Testing for a Loose
Thermocouple Connection
Inspect Connection
Check if the thermocouple connection to the control unit is loose.
Tighten Connection
If loose, tighten it a 1/4 turn past hand tight.
Examine Terminal
Remove the thermocouple and check the terminal to make
sure it is not broken or cracked.
Verify Threads
Ensure the threads are in good order.

Testing for a Defective
Thermocouple
Select Testing Equipment
Use a millivolt-meter or a multi-meter to test for a defective
thermocouple.
Perform Open-Circuit Test
Shows the potential millivolts that a thermocouple can produce when
not under load.
Perform Closed-Circuit Test
Shows the millivolts that can be maintained when the thermocouple is
powering the magnetic coil of a pilotstat device.
Evaluate Results
Replace thermocouple if readings are below specified thresholds.

Open-Circuit Thermocouple
Test
Disconnect Thermocouple
Disconnect the thermocouple from the pilotstat.
Set Up Meter
Select a scale on the millivolt-meter suitable for reading a maximum of
30 mV.
Connect Meter
Connect one lead of the meter to the outer copper conductor of the
thermocouple and the other lead to the end of the inner conductor.
Check Reading
With a pilot flame heating the hot junction of the thermocouple,
the meter should read approximately 30 mV. If the meter reading
is less than 20 mV, the thermocouple needs replacement.

Closed-Circuit Thermocouple Test
Install Test Block
Disconnect the thermocouple
from the pilotstat and install
the test block.
Reconnect Components
Reconnect the thermocouple
to the top of the test block and
relight the pilot burner.
Connect Test Leads
Connect one test lead to the
outer conductor of the
thermocouple and the other
test lead to the side terminal of
the test adapter.
Evaluate Reading
The meter should read about
15 mV. If the meter reads less
than 8 mV, the thermocouple
needs to be replaced.

Testing for a Defective Pilotstat
Coil (Drop-Out Test)
Connect Meter
Connect one lead of the millivoltmeter to the copper conductor and the other
to the terminal on the side of the test adapter.
Extinguish Pilot
Blow out the pilot flame and allow the thermocouple to cool.
Observe Reading
As the thermocouple cools, observe that the reading on the millivoltmeter
slowly decreases.
Evaluate Results
The coil should create enough magnetic field to hold the valve open until the
millivoltage drops to between 5 and 2 mV.

Pilotstat Coil Test Results
Interpretation
Normal Operation
The coil should create enough magnetic field to hold the valve open until the
millivoltage drops to between 5 and 2 mV.
Defective Coil
If the coil drops out with a reading greater than 5 mV, it needs replacement.
Sticking Valve
If the coil holds the valve open with a reading less than 2 mV, the valve is sticking
and should be replaced.
Time Requirement
This dropout of the coil must take place within 90 seconds of the flame going out.

Testing Resistances in Millivolt
Control Systems
Common Problems
Increases in resistance that reduce the current to a point where the gas valve
coils do not operate cause many problems in millivolt control systems.
Causes of Resistance
Loose wiring connections, corrosion to terminals and connectors, poor wire
splices, and excessive wire lengths.
Testing Method
The easiest way to identify where increases in resistance have developed is to
measure the millivolt drop across each component in the electrical circuit.
Diagnosis
Excessive millivolt drop indicates excessive resistances.

Energy Cut-Off (ECO) Device
Purpose
An energy cut-off (ECO) device is a
safety feature added to many
thermostatic gas controls. It monitors
the temperature of the water in the
tank.
Operation
The ECO is a fusible link wired in series
between the thermocouple and the
safety shut-off valve inside the control
valve. If the temperature of the water
exceeds the preset limit (usually
200°F or 94°C), the fuse melts and the
circuit is broken between the
thermocouple and the safety shutoff
valve, and the gas flow to the burner is
terminated.
Replacement
An ECO is a single-use fuse. Once the
device is activated, the gas valve must
be replaced. If the pilot burner does
not remain lit when the reset button is
released, check for continuity through
the ECO wires; the ECO may have
been activated.

Thermal Cut-Off Device (TCO)
Flammable Vapor Protection
In the event of flammable vapour ignition inside the
combustion chamber, it senses the corresponding
increase in temperature and shuts off gas flow to the
main and pilot burners.
Combustion Monitoring
If excessive temperatures inside the combustion
chamber indicate poor combustion because of a
clogged screen or filter or inadequate air for
combustion, the TCO will shut off gas flow to the main
and pilot burners.
Mounting Location
The TCO can be mounted just inside the outer door, or
it can be part of the pilot assembly.
4
Connection Method
If the water heater is equipped with a rod-and-tube
type thermostatic gas control the TCO is usually wired
in series with the ECO and safety shut-off valve.

Testing a Thermal Cut-Off
Switch (TCO)
Access the Component
Remove the outer jacket door.
Disconnect Wires
Disconnect the wire leads from the thermal switch.
Check Reset Button
If the TCO has a manual reset, ensure that the button is pushed in.
Test Resistance
Using a multimeter capable of measuring resistance or an
ohmmeter, place one probe of the meter on each of the wire
connection tabs. There should be no resistance through the
switch.

Integral Thermocouple TCO
Design
If the water heater is
equipped with a TCO that
is integral with the
thermocouple, the
temperature cutoff point
will range depending on
the make and model.
Operation
This style of TCO is
typically an automatic
reset thermal switch.
When activated it will open
the thermocouple circuit
and shut off the main and
pilot burner gas flow.
Troubleshooting
Light the pilot after the
TCO has had sufficient
time to cool down. There is
no routine service
associated with the TCO.
The standard
thermocouple millivolt
output checks would apply.
An adequate millivolt
reading would indicate that
the TCO is closed.
Replacement
If the TCO is an integral
part of the thermocouple it
will not be replaceable as a
separate item. A new pilot
burner assembly must be
installed.

Flammable Vapour Ignition Resistance Sensor
Locate the Sensor
Flammable vapour sensors are usually located near the air intake of the water heater and are designed to shut off the gas
supply to the burner if flammable vapours are present.
Prepare for Testing
Turn the gas valve to the "OFF" position. If the water heater is supplied with 120 volts, de-energize the appliance.
Disconnect Wires
Remove the wires from the sensor.
Test Resistance
Using a multimeter set to Ohms, test the resistance through the sensor. The manufacturer's literature will list an
acceptable range of resistance.
Evaluate Results
If the resistance is not within the range as specified by the manufacturer, replace the sensor.

Testing High-Limit Switches
Identify Switch Location
Most water heaters that come with either a vent damper and those that are power vented will have a high-limit switch located next
to these devices to ensure that sufficient draft is being created through the appliance and into the venting.
De-energize Appliance
Ensure that the appliance is de-energized.
Disconnect Wires
Disconnect the wire leads from the high-limit switch. On some power-vented models, the high limit may be located inside a
protective casing.
Check Reset Button
If the high limit has a manual reset, ensure that the button is pushed in.
Test Resistance
Using a multimeter that can measure resistance or an ohmmeter, place one probe of the meter on each of the wire
connection tabs. There should be no resistance through the switch.

Tankless Water Heaters
Diagnostic Features
Most tankless water heaters can
monitor their operation continuously.
Typically, if a fault occurs, an error
code will flash on a display screen to
assist in diagnosing the fault and help
overcome the problem.
Error Code Access
To display and interpret the error
codes, consult the manufacturer's
literature. Most manufacturers list a
procedure to enable the display of
previous error codes.
Performance Monitoring
Many of these units can also display
water flow rates and outlet water
temperature. Consult the
manufacturer's literature.

Thermistors in Tankless Water Heaters
Function
Thermistors are temperature sensitive
resistors used to supply information to
the circuit board regarding
temperature. All resistors vary with
temperature, but thermistors are
made of semiconductor material with
a resistivity that is especially sensitive
to temperature.
Operation
The resistance of a Negative
Temperature Coefficient (NTC)
thermistor decreases with an increase
in temperature. If the circuit
resistance decreases as the voltage
remains constant, the current will
increase. The amount of current being
supplied to the circuit board through
the thermistor indicates the
temperature at its location.
Control Function
Based on this information, the circuit
board controls the operation of the
modulating gas control and/or the
water flow control valve.

Testing a Thermistor
Disconnect Wires
Disconnect the wire leads from the thermistor and insert the meter
leads into each end of the thermistor plug.
Set Meter
Set the meter to the appropriate Ohm scale (according to the
manufacturer's literature) and read the resistance.
Test Temperature Response
Applying heat to the thermistor bulb should decrease the
resistance, and applying ice to the thermistor bulb should
increase the resistance.
Verify Readings
The manufacturer lists acceptable resistance ranges
depending on the temperature.

Testing Heating Elements in
Tankless Water Heaters
Consult Documentation
Refer to the manufacturer's literature to determine the acceptable
resistance range.
Disconnect Wires
Disconnect the wire leads from the heating element and connect the
meter leads to each terminal of the heating element.
Set Meter
Ensure that the meter is set to the appropriate ohm range.
Test Resistance
Measure and compare the resistance to manufacturer
specifications.

Flow Switches in Tankless Water Heaters
Purpose
All tankless water heaters come with a
flow switch or flow sensor located in
the cold water supply. The purpose of
the flow sensor is to ensure that there
is sufficient water flow to the
appliance to prevent it from damage.
Activation Threshold
Depending on the make and model of
the water heater, the flow rate
required to activate the flow switch
could be as low as 0.4 USGPM (1.5
L/min) or as high as 0.9 USGPM (3.4
L/min).
Testing Methods
To test the flow switch, check that the
flow switch closes its contacts at
minimum flow rate as determined by
the manufacturer's literature by either
viewing the display screen if the
model displays flow rates or
performing a flow test and slowly
opening a hot water faucet.

Performing a Flow Test
Measure Flow Rate
Use a graduated container and time the fill rate.
Establish Minimum Flow
Once the minimum flow rate is established, ensure that there is
sufficient voltage at both terminals of the flow switch.
Check Voltage Type
Consult the manufacturer's literature as the voltage could be either
AC or DC depending on the make and model.
Test Switch Resistance
If the voltage is correct, de-energize the appliance and test the
resistance through the flow switch by disconnecting the wires
from the flow switch and connecting an ohmmeter. There
should be no resistance through the switch when water is
flowing through the heater.

Non-Electrical Problems: Gas
Manifold Pressure
Importance
A number of problems that arise are a result of faults with the gas manifold
pressure.
Potential Issues
If the gas manifold pressure is incorrect, it can lead to stacking, poor burner
flame, and condensation.
Testing Equipment
You should use a manometer to check the manifold pressure. U-tube type and
digital manometers are the most accurate.
Reference Information
You can find a list of the correct manifold pressure on the rating plate attached
to the heater.

Performing a Manifold
Pressure Test
Locate Test Port
Identify the manifold pressure test port on the gas control valve.
Remove Test Plug
Carefully remove the test plug from the manifold pressure port.
Connect Manometer
Insert adapter and connect manometer to the test port.
Measure Pressure
With the water heater operating, read the manifold
pressure on the manometer and compare to
specifications.

Adjusting the Gas Pressure Regulator
Access Adjustment Screw
Remove the regulator adjustment screw cap by inserting a screwdriver into the screw slot and rotating it counterclockwise.
Remove Sealant
Using a small screwdriver, remove the sealant from the adjustment screw top.
Connect Manometer
Connect your manometer to the test outlet of the control unit.
Adjust Pressure
With the burner operating, adjust the gas pressure as necessary. Turn the adjustment screw clockwise to increase
the gas pressure or counterclockwise to decrease the pressure.
Replace Cap
Replace the adjustment screw cap when you are finished.

Checking for Stacking
Shut Off Water
Turn off the cold water supply.
Draw Sample
Draw a small amount of water from the drain valve. Check and note its temperature.
Restore Water Supply
Turn on the cold water supply.
Test Hot Water
Draw water from any hot water faucet. Let the water run for a minute or two, then check and note the
temperature.
Evaluate Results
If the temperature difference is greater than 25°F (14°C), there is a stacking condition.

Causes and Solutions for Stacking
CauseSolution
Too long a dip tubeRemove the dip tube and check its length according to the manufacturer's
specifications. Either correct the length or replace the tube.
Excessive liming of the tankThis is covered later, in the section on liming.
Leaky faucets from the water tankRepair the faucet. These leaks may not always be visible, such as in the case
of the drain line. Remove the drain line to check it for leaks.
Frequent draws of hot waterLimit the number of times hot water is drawn.
Repeated short cycling of the control unitReplace the control unit.

Removing the Dip Tube
Prepare System
Turn off the cold water supply. Do not use any water until the repair job is
finished.
Set Controls
Turn the control unit to the pilot position. Open a hot water faucet and wait for
the water to stop flowing.
Drain Water
Draw four or five buckets of water off the system through the drain cock.
Access Dip Tube
Cut the copper tubing between the shut-off valve and cold-water inlet to the
tank. Remove the dip tube.
Replace Tube
Cut the dip tube to the manufacturer's recommended length or replace it with a
longer one. Apply Teflon tape or non-metallic pipe dope to dip tube threads, and
install the dip tube in the tank.
Reconnect Plumbing
Re-solder the copper. When soldering the last joint, wrap a wet rag around the
pipe to prevent the heat from reaching the dip tube.
Restore System
Turn on the cold water supply. Turn on a hot water faucet until water flows
continuously. Check for water leaks. Turn the control unit to the on position.

Insert the new valve into the tapping and tighten.
Restore System
Turn on the cold water supply. Turn on a hot water faucet until the water starts to flow. Turn on the gas and check for leaks. Relight the pilot and check the
manifold pressure.

Low Water Temperature Problems
ProblemSolution
The burner may be clogged.Clean the burner.
The orifice may be too small.Check the recommended size of the orifice on the rating plate
and resize it.
The gas pressure may be too low.Increase the gas pressure.
The temperature setting on the control unit is set too low.This should have been checked first. Increase the temperature
setting.
Too many people are making use of the water tank.In this case, the water is not getting enough time to reach the
desired temperature. Recommend that the tank be replaced
with a bigger tank if this is possible in the space provided.
The control unit may be out of calibration.Check to see if it is out of calibration, and if so, recalibrate it.

Checking Control Unit Calibration
Initiate Heating Cycle
Draw off enough hot water to ensure that the burner is operating.
Allow Cycling
Allow the thermostat to cycle the burner off.
Set Temperature
Manually turn the thermostat dial to the 130°F (54°C) mark.
Shut Off Water
Turn off the cold water supply.
Check Temperature
Check the hot water temperature at the drain valve.
Evaluate Results
If you find that the thermostat is more than 20°F (8°C) out of calibration, you will need to recalibrate it.

Calibrating a Control Unit
Set Initial Temperature
Turn the temperature dial to the 130°F (54°C) mark. If the temperature of the
water is so high that the burner will not come on, run enough hot water from a
faucet to cause the thermostat to turn the burner on. Then, allow the burner to
operate until the thermostat shuts it off.
Prepare for Testing
Close off the cold water supply. Open the nearest hot water faucet to break the
air lock.
Measure Temperature
Slowly open the drain valve until a flow of water just sufficient to cover the
thermometer bulb is obtained. Wait for the temperature on the thermometer to
stabilize and make a note of it.
Adjust Dial
Turn the temperature dial to correspond to the temperature that you measured.
Remove the temperature dial, mark the location of the stop, and replace the dial.
Test Operation
Turn the dial clockwise until the control snaps on. Turn the dial counterclockwise
slowly until the control just snaps off.
Finalize Calibration
Remove the temperature dial while holding the stop to prevent rotation.
Carefully loosen the stop adjustment nut. Taking care not to move the
temperature adjusting screw, turn the stop until it corresponds with the
reference mark you made.
Verify Calibration
Replace the temperature dial. The actual water temperature should now be
indicated. It is a good procedure to check the water temperature again.

Venting System Checks
Draft Hood
Check to see if a draft hood is
required and in place. If not, it
needs to be added to the system.
Ensure the draft hood has not
been damaged or in any way
altered.
Draft Test
Check that the vent is working.
Ensure that the burner has been
on for at least 10 minutes. Light a
smoke generator and hold it at
the draft hood opening. The
smoke should be drawn into the
draft hood.
Vent Pipe Inspection
Check the venting pipes which
may be broken or have too many
bends. This will need fixing.
Consult manufacturer's
literature for correct venting
layout.
Termination Check
The venting system might not be terminated properly,
leading to a positive pressure being formed in the
vent. This may happen only occasionally, such as on
windy days.
Temperature Evaluation
The water heater may not be hot enough. The
resulting warm air is then unable to rise naturally
through the system.

Common Water Heater Leakage Points
Draft Hood and Flue
Water here could be a result of
rainwater leaking in. You should
also check for condensation,
which may cause further
problems.
Piping Connections
If there is a leak here, turn off the
water and gas supplies and drain
the tank in a proper manner.
Disconnect the piping, apply pipe
joint compound, and replace.
Drain Valve
A leak here could be a result of a
bad gasket, a loose packing nut,
or a valve that is slightly open.
Tighten the handle first. If the
leak persists, the valve is faulty
and needs replacement.
T&P Relief Valve
This often results from a T&P
relief valve that is operating
properly. There may also be some
dirt on the valve seat that needs
to be cleaned.
Anode Rod Fitting
Use the procedure that was
discussed earlier for removing the
dip tube to remove, replace, and
reseal the anode.

Condensation Problems
Low Manifold Pressure
The manifold pressure could be too low. Check the
manifold pressure. If the measured pressure is lower
than stated on the rating plate, you will need to adjust
the manifold pressure.
Burner Orifice Issues
The main burner orifice could be blocked or smaller
than the recommended size. If it is blocked, you must
clean it. If the orifice is smaller than the recommended
size, you should install the correct size orifice.
Flue Obstruction
The flue could have an obstruction. If you find one,
remove it.
Inadequate Draft
Ensure that the draft is adequate, and perform a flue
gas analysis.
Note: When a storage-type water heater is initially activated and the water in the tank is cold, condensation may form.
However, once most of the water is heated, the condensation should cease.

Liming in Water Heaters
What is Liming?
Water contains a number
of impurities. As there is
more heat applied to the
water, more of these
minerals (calcium and
magnesium) are removed
from the water. These
minerals build up as
calcium carbonate
(limescale) on the bottom
of the tank.
Effects of Liming
This buildup acts as an
insulator and reduces the
efficiency of the tank,
causing higher stack (vent)
temperatures. One sign of
liming is a rumbling and
crackling noise coming
from the tank, which is
caused when water
penetrates the layer of
limescale and meets the
hot surface of the water
heater.
Prevention
You can use a water
softener to prevent
limescale formation. This
reduces the number of
hardness minerals in the
water.
Resolution
If there is a lime buildup in
the tank, and it is not
excessive, you can clean it.
If the tank is excessively
limed, you will have to
replace it.

De-Liming a Water Heater Tank
Prepare Tank
Shut off the power, gas, and water supply to the tank. Completely drain the tank
of water.
Create Access Points
Remove the drain valve and install a 6 inch nipple in its place. Remove the anode.
If there is no other apparent opening on the tank, remove either the hot or cold
water nipple.
Initial Cleaning
Use a small pressure washer to flush out as much scale and lime as possible. You
can do this by inserting the pressure washer through one of the holes and then
shining a light through the other hole to see what you are doing.
Chemical Treatment
Once you have removed as much lime and scale as possible, plug the nipple
installed at the drain valve and add either muriatic acid or pickling vinegar to the
tank. Allow it to stand.
Final Cleaning
After this de-liming solution has stood for a while, unplug the nipple and allow
the tank to drain. Once again, use the pressure washer to flush out the tank.
Reassembly
Replace the drain valve, anode, and any other parts that you removed. Turn on
the water. Fill the tank with water. Turn on the power and gas. Start the water
heater.
System Flush
Remove the faucet aerators. Flush out the hot water lines. Replace the faucet
aerators.

Corrosion in Water Heaters
Prevention
Use the anode to prevent corrosion in
the tank. If you notice that the tank is
corroding, then it is possible that
water softener with an incorrect pH
has been added to the tank or the
anode is no longer working.
Water Softener Issues
If water softener with the wrong pH is
being used and is removing too many
of the impurities, you must replace it
with water softener with the correct
pH.
Anode Rod Function
If the anode is not working, you will
need to replace it.

Flue and Vent System Corrosion
Cause of Corrosion
If the air for combustion contains
certain chemical vapours that break
down into acids during the
combustion process and bond with
the water vapour of the fuel gas, these
acids will corrode the flue and vent
systems.
Common Corrosive
Chemicals
•Spray-can repellents
•Cleaning solvents
•Bleaches
•Refrigerants
•Swimming pool chemicals
•Calcium
•Sodium chloride (salt)
•Waxes
•Process chemicals
Prevention
You should make every effort to
prevent these substances from
coming into contact with the flue and
vent system or the air for combustion.

Carbon Monoxide Hazards
What is Carbon Monoxide?
Carbon monoxide is a colourless toxic gas. If enough of it
is inhaled, it can cause death. One of the problems with
carbon monoxide gas is that it is invisible and has no taste
or odour, so it is extremely hard to detect.
Primary Cause
The most common reason for the formation of carbon
monoxide is when there is not enough oxygen to burn the
fuel gas completely, leaving some of the fuel in the flue
gas.
Temperature Factors
Another factor that leads to the formation of carbon
monoxide is if the temperature of combustion of the fuel
gas is too low. For natural gas, the combustion process
must maintain a temperature of approximately 1200°F
(649°C).
Venting Issues
If the venting is blocked in any way, or the gases are not
properly vented, the flue gases will not be able to reach
the outdoors and will remain in the room.

Incomplete Combustion and Carbon Monoxide
Insufficient Oxygen
When there is not enough oxygen to
burn the fuel gas completely, carbon
monoxide forms instead of carbon
dioxide.
Low Combustion
Temperature
If the flame is quenched (cooled due
to too much excess air or flame
contact with a cooler surface) below
1200°F (649°C), combustion is
incomplete.
Venting Problems
Blocked or improper venting
prevents flue gases from escaping,
causing them to recirculate through
the combustion chamber.
Gas Recirculation
Flue gas spillage can re-circulate
through the combustion chamber,
resulting in a lack of combustion air
and further carbon monoxide
production.

Water Heater Component Replacement Guide
When replacing water heater components, always follow manufacturer guidelines and local codes. Ensure the appliance is de-energized and gas
supply is shut off before beginning work. Use appropriate tools and replacement parts designed specifically for the model being serviced.

Water Heater Venting Systems
Natural Draft (Category I)
Uses the natural buoyancy of hot flue
gases to create draft. Requires a
properly sized and installed draft hood.
Most common in residential
applications.
Power Vented (Category III)
Uses a fan to force combustion
products through the vent system. Can
be vented horizontally through a
sidewall. Requires electrical connection
for the fan motor.
Direct Vent (Category IV)
Draws combustion air directly from
outside and vents products of
combustion to the outside through a
sealed system. Ideal for installations
where indoor air quality is a concern.

Water Quality Effects on Water Heaters
Hard Water
Contains high levels of dissolved
minerals, primarily calcium and
magnesium. Causes limescale buildup
on heating elements and tank bottom,
reducing efficiency and potentially
causing premature failure.
•Reduces heat transfer efficiency
•Creates rumbling noises
•Shortens equipment lifespan
Acidic Water
Water with pH below 7.0 can be
corrosive to metal components.
Accelerates corrosion of tank lining,
anode rod, and fittings.
•Accelerates anode rod depletion
•Damages tank lining
•Creates pinhole leaks
High Mineral Content
Water with high levels of iron,
manganese, or sulfur can cause
discoloration, odors, and deposits.
May affect water quality and heater
performance.
•Creates sediment buildup
•Produces odors
•Discolors water

Combustion Analysis for Water Heaters
Ideal RangeWarning LevelCritical Level
Combustion analysis is essential for ensuring water heaters operate safely and efficiently. The chart shows ideal ranges and warning levels for key combustion parameters. Proper combustion should maintain
oxygen levels around 4%, carbon dioxide around 9%, zero carbon monoxide, and stack temperatures around 300°F. Readings outside these ranges indicate potential problems with air supply, venting, or burner
adjustment.

Water Heater Safety Precautions
Electrical Safety
Always de-energize the appliance before servicing electrical
components. Use appropriate testing equipment to verify power is
off. Never bypass safety devices or controls.
Gas Safety
Shut off gas supply before servicing. Test for gas leaks after service
using approved methods. Never use open flames to check for
leaks. Ensure proper combustion air supply.
Scalding Prevention
Set water temperature no higher than 120°F (49°C) to prevent
scalding. Install anti-scald devices at points of use if higher tank
temperatures are needed.
Carbon Monoxide
Verify proper venting to prevent carbon monoxide hazards. Install
carbon monoxide detectors near appliance. Address any venting or
combustion issues immediately.
