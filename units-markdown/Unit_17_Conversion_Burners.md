Preparing a Boiler for
Conversion
Before conversion, a boiler requires careful inspection for cracks or loose
cement in the heating sections, warped doors and door frames, and any
other defects that might permit uncontrolled sootions, warpour acore
and and er. All conditions of this type must be corrected before installing
a gas conversion burner.

Types of Boilers
Wet-base boiler
•In a wet-base boiler [Figure 2-1(a)], the return lines enter
the boiler at its base.
•When converting this type of boiler, there is usually no
firepot required if the proper burner is selected. Check with
the manufacturer.
Dry-base boiler
•A dry-base boiler [Figure 2-1(b)] is one where the boiler
water connections enter at the base of the boiler sections
that sit on top of a dry base.
Boilers sometimes require a firepot to protect against the conversion burner flame impinging on the combustion chamber's metal
sides, back or top. If you are unsure about whether the unit requires a firepot, consult with the manufacturer.

Boiler Inspection Procedure
The following inspection procedure should determine that there are no conditions that make the converted appliance
uneconomical or unsafe.
1.Shut off the fuel.
2.Remove the burner.
3.Remove the flue pipe.
4.Remove the domestic hot water coils (if any) from the combustion chamber.
5.Thoroughly clean all heating surfaces and flue passages with brushes or scrapers to loosen scale and dirt.
6.Clean any residue from low-water cut-off.
7.Vacuum the boiler. Take precautions to preserve the cleanliness and neatness of the premises while removing soot and
debris.
8.Examine the firepot, if any, to determine its condition. Carefully clean the firepot if it is to remain. Be careful not to damage
a fibre-type pot. Resize, replace, reshape, or repair the firepot as required.

Boiler Inspection: Cracks
Visually inspect boiler for cracks in the seams and body. If you detect
cracks, first repair by re-cementing (or replacing) it and then perform a
leak test.
•Check cast-iron sectional boilers for sealing between the boiler
sections. If there are cracks, replace or repair the boiler with furnace
cement in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
•Examine steel boilers for distortion of the side walls. Do not convert if
distortion is severe.

Re-conditioning Boiler Joints
When repairing cracks with furnace cement, be sure to follow the directions on the label.
1.Re-cement joints around the boiler base to prevent air leakage into the combustion chamber. First loosen old joint
compound.
2.Cement all joints between boiler sections.
3.Seal the following areas with furnace cement:
•grate openings; and
•cracks around door frames,

Boiler Leak Test
Boilers require a leak test to ensure that the boiler is watertight.
1.Test the boiler with pressurized water. Dampness at any of the joints
is a sign of a crack.
2.Open drain at bottom of boiler and flush out chamber until water is
clear. Sediment on the bottom affects heat transfer and can hide a
small crack.
3.Repair any cracks found during the leak test in accordance with the
appliance manufacturer's instructions and local regulations.

Combustion Chamber
Lining
Examine the combustion chamber lining for fractures or deterioration
and determine if repair is necessary. If it is in good condition, you can use
the existing chamber liner. If you have to build up a firebrick chamber,
use field-built insulating firebrick rated for service exposure to 2300°F
(674 ° C) combustion products (Figure 2-2). A precast or formed-in-
place Cerafelt combustion chamber is recommended (Figure 2-3).
Cerafelt is a soft fibre ceramic material used in modern oil appliances.

Purpose of Combustion Chamber Lining
The lining is required for three reasons:
•to protect surfaces that do not transfer heat (e.g., the steel outer wall of a boiler);
•to provide a radiant bed for rapid heat transfer to the primary surfaces of the heat exchanger; and
•to prevent flame contact on the heat exchanger walls if the firing chamber is unusually short.

Combustion Chamber
Lining (Continued)
In some cases, required to reduce the size of the combustion chamber for
the new gas fired burner.
The combustion chamber lining in some boilers (such as Type B*) require
insulation all around to prevent excessive heat loss through the non-
heated exchanging surfaces. Insulation should be rated for service to at
least 1800°F (528 °C).
For more information on Type B combustion chambers, see "Combustion
chamber geometry" and Figure 2-13 in the Choosing a conversion burner
section.

Other Boiler Preparation Tasks
1.If the firing door is badly distorted, it cannot be tightly sealed. You must then replace the door.
2.Check location and condition of ductwork. Inspect the condition of sealing and insulation (if required).
3.Verify that the heating unit conforms to Code requirements in terms of clearance from combustibles.

Preparing a Furnace for Conversion
Preparing a gas conversion burner for installation in a furnace requires placing the burner first in first-class condition. One of
the first steps is to make sure that:
•inner steel heat exchanger sections have not rusted through; and
•connections between heat exchanger and combustion chamber are airtight.
Defects of this type are not readily visible to the naked eye, so a heat exchanger leak test is recommended to make sure that
products of combustion do not escape from the furnace into the house.

Furnace Inspection Procedure
The following inspection of the furnace should determine that there are no conditions that make the converted appliance
uneconomical or unsafe.
1.Shut off power to furnace (if electric).
2.Shut off fuel.
3.Remove burner.
4.Remove flue pipe.
5.Thoroughly clean all heating surfaces and flue passages with brushes or scrapers to loosen scale and dirt.
6.Vacuum furnace. Take precautions to preserve the cleanliness and neatness of the premises while removing soot and
debris.
7.Check gaskets on joints between heat exchanger and combustion chamber.
8.Check for cracks in heat exchanger. Replace if cracks are discovered.

Furnace Inspection: Visual Crack Check
Visually inspect furnace for cracks.
•Some hairline cracks open and shut with the heat of the furnace.
•These cracks may not appear during the smoke test, so do a very careful visual inspection.

Steps to Check for Cracks Visually
1.Examine the body with a flashlight.
2.Check through the burner opening with a mirror.
3.Remove fan assembly from blower compartment.
4.Remove draft regulator and plug outlet.
5.Check via fan compartment opening, using a light and mirror, for:
•cracks on seams (or elsewhere);
•warping and distortion of heat exchanger; in the event of a defective heat exchanger, consult the Code to determine if a
repair is possible or if it requires replacement; and
•rust spots.
6.Inspect all other surfaces you could not see from below through the fan compartment. - You can inspect through the
humidifier opening (if any), inspect opening in the warm air plenum, or, in extreme cases, dismantle the furnace.

Furnace Crack Detection
and Replacement
1.If joints seem tight, you can perform a smoke test if allowed by the
appliance manufacturer and/or local regulations.
2.If you detect cracks in the heat exchanger, it must be replaced. It is
usually more cost effective to replace the entire appliance.

Re-conditioning Furnace
Casings and Leaks
If cracks or fractures, especially above the grate level, are found in any of
the casings following cleaning, the casings require replacement.
Repairable leaks around inspection doors, burner mounting plates, or
heat exchanger sections should have a sealing of furnace cement or high
temperature gasket material as recommended by the manufacturer.
Follow the directions on the label.

Re-conditioning Furnace Joints and Openings
1.Cement all joints between sections.
2.Tightly grout ash pit to the floor.
3.Seal the following areas with furnace cement:
•openings for grate shaker bars;
•cracks around door frames; and
•under clinker door.

Furnace Smoke Test
Test the airtightness of the combustion chamber to ensure that no unwanted air leaks in. Conduct a smoke test only if allowed
by the appliance manufacturer and/or local regulations.
1.Block the furnace flue outlet.
2.Light smoke generator and place in fire chamber.
3.Quickly close feed door and observe whether any smoke or odour escapes from the registers upstairs.

Other Furnace Preparation Tasks
1.Check the location and condition of ductwork. Inspect the condition of sealing and insulation, if required.
2.Verify that the heating unit conforms to Code requirements in terms of clearance from combustibles.

Preparing Venting System
for Conversion
Upon checking and repairing the boiler or furnace as necessary, check
and prepare the combustion air and venting system for the conversion.

Air Requirements for Venting System
If the automatic oil burner operated trouble-free, the area around the heating plant could have enough air infiltration for
combustion and for diluting the flue gases.
However, you must make sure that the new installation conforms to the local Codes and Regulations.
1.Check that combustion air ducts or openings are provided and that they meet local Code requirements.
2.Check whether ventilation openings are required. If so, ensure they meet local Code requirements.
Note: Make sure there are no return-air outlets in the furnace area.

Venting System Inspection
Prior to installation of the venting system of the oil-fired appliance, your task is to ensure that it meets the requirements of
CSA B149.1.
Note: Movable flue pipe dampers are not permitted on any gas conversion installation.
1.Inspect the chimney for unsafe conditions such as:
•no liner;
•deteriorated masonry;
•excessive soot;
•other blockage.
2.Inspect the vent connector for proper gauge, size, and condition.
3.Size the vent connector based on the size of the draft hood or according to the Code.
4.Ensure that the clearance between the flue pipe and combustible material strictly adheres to the Code. Table 8.6 of the
Code identifies special clearance to combustible requirements for vent connectors serving a conversion burner with a draft
hood.

Venting System: Interference Check
1.Check whether an exhaust fan, kitchen ventilation system, clothes dryer, and/or fireplace is installed in the building. If so,
ensure that the venting of these appliances does not interfere with the conversion burner operation.
•Turn on all the exhaust fans of the appliances in the common vent.
•Cycle the conversion burner.
•Check the draft in the venting system with a draft gauge to ensure there is adequate draft as specified by the appliance
manufacturer.

Sizing a Chimney
Most oil and solid-fuel appliances use a masonry chimney to exhaust the flue products; however, since these chimneys are designed to exhaust flue products that are hotter than those
of a gas burner, it may be too large and not draft properly, causing the flue products to condense. If venting a conversion burner uses a masonry chimney, it must meet the Code
requirements for construction standards and size. To size a chimney, follow this procedure:
1.Size the chimney or flue pipe using good engineering practise or the Code.
2.The masonry chimney is the correct size and is lined with clay tile or transite (which protects the mortar from the flue gases). It can be used if it meets the requirements of the
National Building Code or a local building code. Ensure there is a cleanout.
3.If the masonry chimney is too large, install an approved liner (Figure 2-4).

Venting Requirements for Chimneys
Determine the layout and configuration of the venting system before proceeding with the gas conversion to ensure that it can
be installed according to the general venting requirements in Annex C of CSA B149.1.

Chimney Venting Configurations
An appliance
Can be individually vented into a chimney
equipped with a draft hood and the
chimney is sized and lined (Figure 2-5)
An appliance with fan-assist
burner
Can be vented into chimney if there is a
draft-hood appliance also vented into the
same chimney (Figure 2-6).
An appliance with fan-assist
burner
Cannot be vented into a chimney on its
own. This configuration is prohibited
(Figure 2-7).

Prohibited Installation
Figure 2-7 Prohibited installation (single fan-assist appliance vented to
chimney)

Draft Control Devices
The type of conversion burner selected determines the choice of draft
control device. Read the manufacturer's instructions and the Code
requirements. Follow the procedure below i hen installing a draft control
device.
1.Determine which type of draft control device (if any) is required:

Draft Control Device Selection
Burner typeDraft control device
Atmospheric conversion burner applicationsRequire draft hoods.
Power burner applicationsMust use double-acting barometric draft regulators if specified
by the manufacturer. · In semi-revertible appliances, install a
double- acting barometric damper so relief opening is at least 12
inches (30 cm) above the highest flue passage. · Figure 2-8
shows the correct and incorrect locations in which to place a
barometric damper in a power burner conversion.

Draft Control Device
Installation
1.Install the draft control device in the same room as the heating
appliance. This ensures that the same atmospheric pressure is acting
on the heat exchanger and the draft control device.

Choosing a Conversion
Burner
There are numerous criteria for selecting the correct conversion burner,
such as:
•basic design of the appliance (combustion chamber size and shape);
•input requirement; and
•type of gas.

Burner Selection
Considerations
When selecting a specific type of burner, investigate the capabilities of
the burner since design variations among manufacturers provide varying
performance levels for the same type of burner. vanations among
manufacturers are made by the same manufacturers of oil burners and
look similar.
Review the manufacturer's specifications and recommendations before
specifying any particular burner model.
Each conversion burner should bear the seal of approved testing body
certifying compliance with ANSI Z21.8.

Types of Conversion
Burners
There are two main types of conversion burners, classified according to
how the combustion air is distributed:
Conversion burnerDescription
Natural draft (atmospheric)
burners
Use the combustion air
naturally supplied to the
combustion chamber
Power burnersUse a mechanical device to
supply combustion air at
varying pressures

Natural Draft (Atmospheric) Burners
CSA B149.1 defines a natural draft burner as "a burner not equipped with a mechanical device for supplying combustion air".
There are two main types of atmospheric burners, designed to provide the required flame geometry (shape of the flame);
•upshot; and
•inshot

Upshot Burner
The upshot burner (Figure 2-9) fires vertically with the flame being diverted by a spreader. The flame is generally circular in
shape and has a uniform cross-section.
This type of burner is mainly used with furnaces or boilers originally manufactured for coalburning use.
By removing grates and ashpit doors, the conversion burner can be installed in the ashpit section and the flame spreader
distributes the heat from the firepot up to the dome and heating surfoces.

Upshot Atmospheric Burner
Design
The atmospheric upshot burner design consists of a series of ports, slots,
or ribbons whereby the flames fire vertically—generally uniform in
height—in the combustion chamber.

Inshot Burner
An inshot burner (Figure 2-10) fires horizontally into the combustion
chamber. It may have a spreader or target plate downstream of the
burner head to direct the flame.
Inshot conversion burners are mainly intended to replace oil burners.

Oil Burner Mounting
Oil burners are generally flange-mounted and fire into a refractory or
stainless-steel combustion chamber within a furnace body.

Power Burners
Power burners (Figure 2-11) come with a mechanical device, such as a fan
or blower, to provide pressurized combustion air to the burner. This
allows better control of the combustion process and a high input for a
given volume of combustion space. The pressure, at which the air is
delivered, as well as the burner design, provides the flame geometry.

Burner Selection Criteria
Before reaching the final decision as to what burner is best suited for the
appliance, consider the following conditions to ensure proper selection
and application of the burner to the appliance:
•firing rate (input range) of the burner;
•flue gas travel; and
•combustion chamber geometry.

Calculating Firing Rate
The firing rate of the burner must match the input of the appliance being converted, and in no The liming fate of the burner be set at a firing
rate that exceeds or is less than that specified by the manufacturer.
There are several methods to determine the firing rate.
MethodDescription
Heat loss of the buildingThe heat loss of the building can be calculated using the
principles and guidelines established in the ASHRAE Handbook-
Fundamentals or in the Heating, Refrigeration, and Air
Conditioning Institute of Canada's (HRAI) guidelines. When a
proper building survey is completed and the hourly heat loss
calculated, set the conversion burner Btu input at this calculated
amount after the appliance efficiency rating is factored in. For
example, if the calculated heat loss is 100 000 Btu/h and the
appliance efficiency rating is 80%, the conversion burner input
should be 125 000 Btu/h.

Calculating Firing Rate
(Continued)
MethodDescription
Rating plateCheck the input and output ratings on
the rating plate (if available) or the
manufacturer's recommendations. Do
not exceed the marked input rating.
Burner nozzle sizeIf the boiler is being converted from oil,
use the burner nozzle size to calculate
the burner input. You can calculate the
required input using the following
formula: · Burner nozzles are rated in
US gallons/h. · One US gallon of No. 2
fuel oil equals 140 000 Btu. · Input =
Nozzle rating × 140 000 Btu.

Calculating Firing Rate
(Continued)
MethodDescription
Boiler horsepower ratingIf the boiler's rating is written in
boiler horsepower (BHP), you
can calculate the input on the
horsepower rating and
projected efficiency. You can
calculate the required input
using the following formula: ·
One BHP equals 33 475 Btu/h. •
Input = BHP × 33 475 Btu/h.

Calculating Firing Rate: Grate Area
Coal-fired furnaces have a definite ratio of output to grate area, with the grate area representing the capacity of coal that could
be burned in the unit.
For conversion purposes, you can base the input of atmospheric burners on the area of the grate (Table 2-1):
•Measure round grates by their diameter.
•Measure rectangular grates by their area.

Setting Manifold Pressure
and Orifice Size
Once you have determined the input, you can set the manifold pressure
and orifice size according to manufacturer's input tables.

Flue Gas Travel Modes
As previously mentioned, oil and solid-fuel appliances have three basic
modes of flue gas travel. These are shown in Figure 2-12.

Flue Gas Travel Mode Descriptions
Flue gas travel modeDescriptionConversion
UpdraftFlue gas travel is constantly upward with
flue products exiting at or very near the
highest point of the heat exchanger.
All burner types may be considered for
this conversion.
Semi-revertibleFlue gas travel is upward initially, then
downward to exit the appliance. The
centerline of the flue outlet is 12 inches
(30 cm) or more above the burner port
level.
Some atmospheric and all power burners
may be considered for this conversion.
RevertibleFlue gas travel is upward initially, then
downward to exit the appliance. The
centerline of the flue outlet is located
from less than 12 inches (30 cm) above
burner port level.
Revertible appliances are only to be
converted according to Clause 7.8.1 of
CSA B149.1. See Chapter 1. Guidelines for
converting appliances, Code
requirements.

Combustion Chamber
Geometry
Certain types of burners are better adapted to one boiler than another.
For example, where short fireboxes are encountered, it is often better to
use a burner with a r of onamply, while avoid long flames that impinge
upon metal surfaces. Similarly, the might noat release and to are and
match that of the combustion chamber whenever possible (i. geomory
offame for a round chamber, an elongated flame for a rectangular
chamber).

Combustion Chamber Designs

Mounting Flanges
The burner air tube may be available in different lengths or with an
adjustable flange (Figure 2-14). The length of the air tube must be
selected according to the instructions provided hy the manufacturer of
the boiler, and it must match the thickness of the boiler wall complete
with its insulation.

Air Tube and Mounting Plate Sizing
Select an air tube and mounting plate sized so that the end of the air tube will be flushed with, or no more than 1/4 inch short of,
the inside of the appliance combustion chamber front wall when the burner is mounted. If it extends into the combustion
chamber, there may be damage from overheating (Figure 2-15). The seal between the burner and the boiler must be airtight.

Air Tube Overheating
Prevention
If the air tube extends into the combustion chamber, there may be
damage from overheating (Figure 2-15). The seal between the burner
and the boiler must be airtight.

Burner Installation and Flue
Gas Analysis
After installing the burner, a gas technician/fitter must do the start-up
checks and conduct a flue gas analysis for reasons of combustion
efficiency and for the safety of the dwelling occupants. An accurate flue
gas analysis determine the levels of carbon dioxide, excess air, stack
temperature, and whether the combustion process is complete.

Theory of Combustion
Combustion is a chemical process in which the rapid oxidation of fuel results in the production of energy (heat). To start and sustain
combustion, you must have ingredients mixed together in the correct proportions:
•fuel, usually natural gas or liquid petroleum gases;
•oxygen, obtained from the air surrounding a burner;
•heat, enough to bring the fuel to ignition point; and
•uninhibited chemical chain reaction.
If any one of these elements is absent, combustion will not take place nor will it support itself after an element is removed. This relationship
is commonly referred to as the combustion triangle (Figure 3-1).

Triangle is excerpted from the "Combustion Analysis and Fuel Efficiency"
manual courtesy of ESCO Group. For a more thorough understanding of
combustion analysis, visit www.escogroup.org

Stoichiometric or Perfect Combustion
Stoichiometric or perfect combustion is the process of combining chemically exact amounts of fuel and oxygen so that both
components are totally consumed, with no combustibles or uncombined oxygen remaining in the flue gases.
The ratio of oxygen to fuel in perfect combustion is as follows:
Amount of cu ft of oxygenRequired to burn 1 ft3 ofRatioPerfect combustion
chemical formula
2 ff3Natural gas2:1For natural gas and oxygen:
CH4 + 202 -> CO2 + 2H2O +
Heat
5 ff3Propane5:1For propane and oxygen:
C3H8 + 5O2 -> 3CO2 + 4H2O
+ Heat
Remember that because perfect mixing of gases is only theoretically possible, perfect combustion cannot actually be maintained in a
combustion chamber.

Complete Combustion
Because air is 20% oxygen (O2) and 80% nitrogen (N2), you need to supply more air to the burner than perfect combustion with pure
oxygen would require.
You can express the air requirements for burning natural gas and propane in the following ratios:
Amount of cu ft of airRequired to burn 1 cu ft ofRatio
10 cu ftNatural gas10:1
25 cu ftPropane25:1

Ensuring Complete Combustion with Excess Air
A way to ensure that these ratios are maintained is by introducing excess air into the combustion chamber. The quantity of
excess air is often one and a half times the air needed for stoichiometric combustion.
When excess air is introduced, however, more gases require heating by the same amount of Btu. At the same time, a larger
volume of flue gas is forced through the heat exchanger in a shorter period of time, causing a decrease in heating efficiency
due to higher flue gas temperature.
By analyzing the amount of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the flue gas, you can adjust the amount of excess air to achieve
combustion with minimal loss of heating efficiency. Flue gas temperature is also an indication of combustion efficiency.

Flue Gas Analysis
The combustion process forms products that are exhausted through the flue or chimney stack. These are referred to as flue
gases. Analyzing the contents of the flue gases can help determine whether the conversion burner is properly installed and is
operating safely.
The two main reasons for analyzing the flue products are:
•to determine appliance efficiency; and
•to ensure the burner is operating safely.
Flue gas measurement is always taken as close as possible to the flue collar and before any draft control devices.
For more information on instruments for flue gas measurement, refer to Unit 2 Fasteners, tools, and testing instruments.

About Appliance Efficiency
An appliance is most efficient when the greatest amount of usable heat is produced in its combustion chamber for a given
amount of fuel being burned. Essentially, an appliance is most efficient when the amount of its input is near to the amount of
its output.
Combustion efficiency = The relationship between input and output is also called steady state efficiency.

Seasonal Efficiency and AFUE
To determine the overall efficiency of an appliance under actual usage conditions, the other energy losses to consider are:
•off cycle losses such as standby losses;
•room air escaping up the venting system; and
•the input consumed by a standing pilot.
The more standby losses that occur, the more often the appliance has to cycle on and the longer it takes to reach the setpoint
temperature.
Overall annual efficiency is called the annual fuel utilization efficiency (AFUE). Seasonal efficiency is the efficiency of the
appliance based on one season of usage, whereas AFUE is based on usage over a one-year period.

Analyzing for Efficiency
Analyzing the flue gas is a way to determine the appliance combustion
efficiency. This analysis comprises the measurement of two items from
the same location at the same time:
•the percent of carbon dioxide (or the percent of oxygen); and
•the net stack temperature.
With these two measurements, you can obtain the combustion efficiency
of the appliance from a chart. Electronic flue gas analyzers are capable of
continuously measuring the levels of O2 and the flue gas temperature
and then calculating the appliance's efficiency.

Percent of CO2 in Flue Gas
The percentage of carbon dioxide in the flue gas sample at perfect combustion is known as the ultimate % CO2.
This percentage is based on comparing the volume of CO2 to the volume of remaining dry flue gases. At perfect combustion
and with no excess air, the theoretical percentage of CO2 will be at its highest possible level (Figure 3-2).

Ultimate % CO2 of Natural
Gas and Propane
Since the chemical makeup of each fuel gas is different, each fuel gas
produces different amounts of CO2.
Table 3-1 compares the ultimate % CO2 ratings between natural gas and
propane.
GasUltimate % CO2
Natural gas11.9%
Propane13.9%

Oxygen (O2) in Flue Gas
Another option for measuring the combustion efficiency is to use the
percent of oxygen in the flue gas to evaluate the combustion process.
Since there is a direct relationship between amounts of CO2 and O2 in
the flue gas, you can use either one to determine the combustion
efficiency.
During complete combustion as shown in Figure 3-2, as O2 goes higher,
CO2 goes lower. Notice that at approximately 50% excess air, the
quantities of CO2 and O2 are equal.

Flue Gas Temperature
The second reading required for an efficiency test is the flue gas temperature. This temperature indicates the amount of heat
absorbed by the heat exchanger, which is in turn affected by how much air is passing through the combustion chamber. By
measuring flue gas temperature, you can gauge the amount of energy lost to the atmosphere. The difference between the flue
gas temperature and the ambient (room) temperature is the net stack temperature.
Ideally, for an appliance or heating plant to be 100% efficient, the temperature of the flue gas would have to be equal to room
temperature. In other words, all of the heat produced during combustion would have been absorbed by the heat exchanger
and transferred to its application.

Flame Temperature
Reduction with Air and
Excess Air
For example, at perfect combustion, the temperature of the combustion
process involving natural gas and oxygen is around 5000°F (2760 °C).
When air is introduced, the flame temperature is reduced to around
3550°F (1950 °C) because of the dilution effect of the nitrogen passing
through the combustion process. As more excess air is added to ensure
complete combustion, the flame temperature is further reduced.

Plotting Combustion
Efficiency
Once you have the levels of CO2 (or the levels of O2) and the net stack
temperature, you can use a combustion efficiency chart as shown in
Figure 3-3 to determine the level of appliance efficiency. Electronic flue
gas analyzers automatically calculate the appliance efficiency based on
measured readings of O2 and net stack temperature.

Natural Gas Combustion Efficiency Example
You can use the chart in Figure 3-3 to plot the combustion efficiency of a boiler burning natural gas under the following
conditions:
•CO2 is 9.5% (O2 reading is 4%).
•Flue gas temperature is 365 °C (690°F).
•Room temperature is 15 °C (59°F).
To plot the combustion efficiency, use the following procedure:
1.Establish the net stack temperature (365 °C 15 °C = 350 °C).
2.Draw a vertical line (dotted) from the 9.5% point on the CO2 scale.
3.Draw a horizontal line (dotted) from the net flue gas temperature line at 350 °C (662°F).
4.The two lines meet on the % combustion efficiency curve at 75.
5.Thus, the combustion efficiency for this appliance is 75%.

Impact of Adjustments on
Efficiency
Notice if adjustments were made (for example, reducing the draft) and
maintained all the conditions but lowered the net stack temperature to
220 °C (428°F), the efficiency increases to 80%.

Propane Combustion Efficiency Example
You can use the chart in Figure 3-4 to plot the combustion efficiency of a boiler burning propane under the following
conditions:
•CO2 is 8% (O2 reading is 6.8%).
•Flue gas temperature is 475 °C (887°F).
•Room temperature is 75 °C (167°F).

Plotting Propane Combustion Efficiency
To plot the combustion efficiency, use the following procedure:
1.Establish the net stack temperature (475 °C = 75 °C = 400 °C).
2.Draw a vertical line (dotted) from the 8% point on the CO2 scale.
3.Draw a horizontal line (dotted) from the net flue gas temperature line at 400 °C (752°F).
4.The two lines meet on the % combustion efficiency curve at 69.
5.Thus, the combustion efficiency for this appliance is 69%.

Reasons for Poor Efficiency
In general, the higher the flue gas temperature, the lower the efficiency.
The following conditions reduce heat efficiency because they raise the
temperature of the flue gas.
ConditionDescription
Over firing of burnerA heating appliance is designed to
produce a certain amount of heat.
Over firing creates additional heat
that cannot be recovered and,
hence, escapes up the flue. This
causes a rise in the stack
temperature because it is unable to
exchange the extra heat.
Insufficient air flow across heat
exchanger
Reduces the heat transfer and
increases the fuel consumption

Incorrect Excess Air Supply
ConditionDescription
Incorrect excess air supplyThe levels of excess air can be measured by the quantity of
oxygen in the flue gases. Can cause: lazy flame -
incomplete combustion and sooting
Too much excess air can cause:
•raised stack temperature by allowing flue gases to escape too fast for heat exchanger to absorb the heat
•flame impingement
•noise in combustion process leading to customer complaints

Draft Conditions and Dirty Heat Exchangers
ConditionDescription
Draft conditionsDraft conditions can result in high or low flue gas temperatures,
the production of carbon monoxide and aldehydes, and/or flue
gas spillage. The air should be adjusted to approximately -0.02
inch w.c. (5 Pa) overfire draft by adjusting the draft regulator.
Dirty heat exchangersA dirty heat exchanger surface insulates the equipment and
prevents effective heat transfer, increasing fuel consumption.
Main causes of incorrect draft are:
•improper setting of the air shutter
•wrong barometric setting
•long horizontal vent connector
•poor vent design

Incorrect Neutral Pressure Point Setting and Dirty Filters
ConditionDescription
Incorrect neutral pressure point setting (over fire pressure)An incorrect draft control device or an incorrectly adjusted draft
control device can lead to a neutral pressure point setting that
disturbs the draft and velocity of the flue products.
Dirty filtersDirty filters on a forced-air furnace reduce the air flow across the
heat exchanger, decreasing the heat exchange capabilities of the
appliance.

Analyzing for Safety: Carbon Monoxide and
Aldehydes
The main reason for analyzing the flue products is for safety reasons. Make sure that there is complete combustion and that
there is no carbon monoxide (CO) being emitted.
Even though the appliance is operating efficiently and there is enough excess air being introduced (i.e., the CO2, O2, and stack
temperatures are within acceptable range), the burner can still be emitting CO and aldehydes.
Aldehydes are a group of transparent, colourless gases with a suffocating smell, produced by the partial oxidation of fuel gas.
Because of this, they are easily detected. They are toxic and irritating to the eyes, throat, and nose.
Often when CO is produced, it is accompanied by aldehydes.

Carbon Monoxide Levels and Safety Caution
Generally speaking, as you adjust the appliance to obtain higher combustion efficiencies, there is a danger that CO levels will
increase. CO should be maintained at very low levels and should not exceed 50 ppm (on an air-free basis2).
Caution! Carbon monoxide is toxic, odour-free, and life-threatening. It is very important to use the flue gas analyzer to
check for levels of CO after installing a conversion burner.
2Since the flue gas contains varying quantities of air (depending on percent excess air), the CO limit is usually specified on an
air-free basis. The air-free factor is the ratio of the ultimate % CO2 of the gas being burned to the actual % CO₂ in the flue gas
sample. For example, for natural gas er the gas sample with 8.8% and a flue gas sample with 8.8% CO2, a carbon monoxide
concentration of 0.03% in the actual sample would represent 0.04% on an air-free basis. [(11.7 ÷ 8.8) x 0.03 = 0.041

Percentage of CO2 in Complete Combustion
Since excess air is required for complete combustion, there will be higher levels of oxygen in the flue gas and less CO2 than the
ultimate percent.
For example, if 50% excess air were introduced, there would be additional 1 ftº of oxygen and 4 ft3 of nitrogen in the flue gas.
The total flue gas would be as shown in the following formula:
CH4 + 2O2 + 8N2 + O2 + 4N2 → CO2 + 2H2O + 8N2 + O2 + 4N2
The dry sample (without the water) would be one-part CO2 in 14 total parts, and the percentage of CO2 would only be 1/14, or
just over 7%.
Note that the percent of CO2 does not necessarily indicate complete combustion. For example, in referring to Figure 3-2, a
10% CO2 reading can indicate either negative excess air (90%) or positive excess air (110%). It is therefore necessary to also
measure the CO content to ensure complete combustion.

Reasons for Incomplete
Combustion
CO and aldehydes are produced from incomplete combustion, under the following
circumstances:
CircumstanceDescription
Lack of excess airThis is the most common reason for the
production of CO. However, if you have
analyzed the flue gas for levels of CO2
and O2 and have determined that
excess air is not the cause of the
problem, poor mixing on the burner,
chilling of the flame, or a cracked heat
exchanger are possible causes.
Poor mixing on the burnerWrong burner selection can mean poor
mixing of fuel and air, causing
incomplete combustion.

More Reasons for Incomplete Combustion
CircumstanceDescription
Flame impingementCO can be produced when a flame is chilled below ignition temperature. This
occurs when the flame patterns allow the flame to contact heating surfaces
before complete combustion has taken place.
Cracked heat exchangerCracked heat exchangers can cause the heated supply air to come in contact
with the flue products and the flame, interrupting the combustion process.
Significant gas leakA significant gas leak in the pilot line or in the vicinity of the combustion
chamber could result in incomplete combustion.
Burner malfunctionA damaged or improperly positioned main burner could result in flame
impingement and poor mixing on the burner.

After the adjustments, conduct another flue gas analysis to ensure you have complete combustion and good combustion efficiency.

Burner Installation and
Start-up Checks
The proper installation of a conversion burner is critical to the safe and
efficient operation of the appliance. The installation must be carried out
as specified by the conversion burner manufacturer's installation
instructions, and it must meet the Code requirements. Consequently,
doing all checks and adjustments with safety and efficiency in mind is a
must.

Burner Installation Steps
Plan the installation of a burner so that its controls are readily accessible for inspection, cleaning, adjustments, and repairs.
Conversion burners come as a complete package, but you must:
•choose the correct orifice size and air tube components to suit the input;
•position the sleeve and burner; and
•set the air shutter or band if required.
Details of various burners differ. Be sure to follow the manufacturers' installation instructions.

Gas Orifice Installation
Many conversion burners come with orifices for both natural gas and propane.
Install the appropriate gas orifice.
The orifice may be permanently installed into the end of an orifice nipple (Figure 3-8), which needs checking or drilling to the
correct size. The nipple is installed between the gas valve and the burner. For other makes, the appropriate office plate or
diaphragm needs to be selected and installed with O-rings and/or gaskets between the gas supply pipe and the air tube (Figure 3-
9)
If the orifice is adjustable, follow the manufacturer's instructions and adjust the orifice for correct input.

Orifice Plate Installation
Figure 3-9 Orifice plate installation

Air Tube Components
Manufacturers have different air tube components that need to be
verified or selected and assembled to match the appliance input.
Different manufacturers may use some of the following air tube
components:
•flame retention heads;
•air diffuser plates (Figure 3-10); and
•nozzles.

(Divisions of C. Cowles & Company)

Air Adjustments
Figure 3-11 shows some of the typical types of devices used to adjust amount of combustion air. The burner manufacturer
supplies recommended initial settings based on the firing rate of the appliance, but these are intended for use as a starting
point only. Final adjustments must be made while performing a flue gas analysis.

Air Shutter and Band Adjustments
Some burners come with both an air shutter and band. The primary differences between the two are their ease of adjustment
and their total airflow area. On combined units, the shutter is the two suited for low rate adjustments, and the band for high
rate adjustments.

Burner Sleeve Location
Conversion burners may be mounted in a sleeve that is sealed to the combustion chamber with refractory material. The burner can then be removed from
the sleeve for servicing or repair.
Position the burner sleeve and nozzle 1 inch (25 mm) short of the inside of the combustion chamber (Figure 3-12). This protects the burner nozzle from the
hot combustion chamber temperatures.
Do the following before permanently setting the burner in place:
1.Check that the burner nozzle and pilot are free of foreign materials.
2.Check that the spark igniter has not been damaged or displaced.

Burner Location Guidelines
The burner must have solid support on fireproof material both front and rear and be level in both directions. Table 3-2 gives typical burner location guidelines.
Exercise care when installing the burner to avoid undue strain on or distortion of the burner tube or other component that would impair its functioning.

required by the Code, the Atter oompleting and the ready for start-up
and adjustment. In some localities, you may need to consult the
authorities having jurisdiction (AHJ) regarding local start-up
requirements (e.g., an inspector may need to be on site during start-up).
Burner manufacturers may supply a specification guide (Table 3-3) to
assist in the initial set-up of the burner. Use this as the starting setting
only. Adjust air settings, if necessary, after perfor ung combustion
testing.

Checking Combustion Using
Instruments
Do not attempt to confirm combustion simply by inspecting the flame
visually. You must use combustion test instruments (Figure 3-13). Failure
to properly verify or adjust combustion could allow unsafe operation of
the burner, resulting in severe personal injury, substantial property
damage, or death. Modern handheld instruments allow you to adjust the
burner system while watching the results on a monitor, tablet, or
smartphone. You can also store, print, and create reports of the results.

Combustion Adjustment Procedure
The following are general procedures that can be used if manufacturer's instruction are not available:
1.Initiate a call for heat.
2.Adjust the draff or breech pressure to the appliance manufacturer's recommended level after flame has stabilized. A breech pressure that
does not exceed -0.04 inch w.c. is generally acceptable.
3.Measure the CO level and adjust air settings, if necessary, to temporarily raise CO to about 50 ppm for a test point.
4.Measure the O2 or CO2 at the 50 ppm CO level. For this discussion, assume the O2 is 1.5% (11% CO2).
5.Open the air adjustment until the O2 level increases by at least 1% or to 3% O2 (whichever is higher). This should reduce the CO level and
provide a margin of reserve air to accommodate variable conditions.
6.Sample the CO level again. It should be in the 0-20 ppm range.
7.Check the draft to ensure it still meets specifications. If a major change in draft is required, repeat the above steps.
8.Check draft regulator for spillage. Confirm the condition of the chimney if spillage is present.
9.Verify stack temperature meets appliance manufacturer's recommendations.
10.Perform any final adjustments and lock the air settings securely. Run the burner through several cycles to verify prompt ignition and stable
burner operation.
11.Record the combustion performance readings, burner settings, and appliance data on a start-up form and on a start-up tag.
12.Hang the start-up tag in a prominent, safe location on or near the burner for future reference.

Limits, Controls, and Interlocks
Depending on the input and the type of appliance, the start-up checks can be very simple or very complex. The limits, controls, and interlocks that may
require checking include:
•fan switch;
•flow switch;
•low-water cut-off;
•pressure gauges;
•water-fill controls;
•pressure controls;
•pressure relief valve and discharge piping;
•steam-pressure controls;
•expansion tank;
•circulator and controls;
•limits:
•thermostat location and voltage; and
•heat anticipator.
The Code requires you to leave the appliance in a safe operating condition. Therefore, you must check all safeties and interlocks before leaving. Some may
be checked before start-up, others may need to be checked after start-up.

Checks After Start-up
Do the following checks after start-up. Make any necessary adjustments.
1.Check burner operation.
2.To light up the burner safely, follow the start-up directions provided by the burner manufacturer.
3.Cycle the burner on and off several times with the thermostat or aquastat. Ensure sequence occurs as designed.
4.Ensure any potable water connections meet the plumbing code for required crossconnection devices.
5.Check draft control device for proper operation. If you use a barometric draft control, use a draft gauge to measure and
adjust the draft as required by the appliance manufacturer.
6.Conduct flue gas analysis on all conversion burners.
7.Adjust the air shutters as required.
8.Clock the meter to ensure burner input is correct.
9.Check the fan motor, blower speed, and pulley size, if applicable.
10.Oil the motor, if required.

Completing the Installation
In some jurisdictions, upon completing the installation, the installer must
immediately notify the gas supplier and the AHJ that the installation is
complete.
Important: CSA B149.1 clearly specifies the installer's responsibilities.
Review these before, during, and after the conversion.

Removal of Old Fuel System
The contract between the installer and the customer will detail the installer's responsibilities about disposing the old fuel
system.
Unless otherwise stated in the contract, all parts removed from the appliance such as the oil burner, oil lines, and valves, or
grates and ash pit door, should be left on the premises for the customer to dispose.
Check Clause 4.3 of CSA B149.1 to determine the tasks involved in removing the old fuel system.
Note: Some tanks were installed before basement steps were installed, so the tank may need to be cut apart to get it out. At
all times, have an adequate fire extinguisher (ABC type) handy as blades can become hot and ignite vapours.

Protection of Property and Final Cleanup
At all times, protect the customer's property with an acceptable oil-absorbent material and carefully clean up all debris or spills
created during the installation.
IfThen
You are to leave the tank on the customer's property.A qualified technician/fitter should empty the tank out
following all regulatory requirements for safe transportation
and disposal. Shut off the tank outlet valve, remove the filter,
and plug or cap the valve outlet.
You are to leave the tank indoors on the customer's
property.
Remove the fill pipe and cap or plug the exposed fill pipe
opening, but do not remove or plug the vent pipe.
The tank is located outdoors.Disconnect and cap or plug the fill and vent pipes as close as
practicable to the tank.
Do a final cleanup of work area before leaving the premises.

Instructions to Customer
In accordance with Clause 4.3.6 of CSA B149.1:
1.Advise the user of the appliance in writing of the procedures to be followed in discontinuing the supply of fuel oil.
2.Inform the customer about the hazards of flammable liquids and vapours and instruct them to keep flammable products away from the
vicinity of the appliance.
3.Instruct the customer on how to properly and safely operate the converted unit (once the conversion is complete).
4.Inform the customer about the periodic maintenance required based on the conversion manufacturer's instructions.
5.Post the manufacturer's instructions in a prominent location near the appliance.
6.Affix a record of the installation adjustment data to the burner or the converted appliance, which contains the following data:
•input in ft3/hr (m3/s); a)
•manifold pressure setting; b)
•measured flue gas temperature; c)
•% CO2 or % 02: d)
•CO; and e)
•f) date and installer's name.
