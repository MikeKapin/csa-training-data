Conductor Ampacity
Definition
Ampacity is the current-carrying
capacity of electric conductors
expressed in amperes.
Resistance Factors
The larger the AWG number of a
conductor, the greater the electrical
resistance per unit length.
The resistance of a conductor increases
with temperature and, as resistance
increases, the voltage drop increases.
Length Considerations
Long wiring runs may require the use of larger-gauge conductors in order to maintain
required circuit voltage values and remain within ampacity limits - the same reason for
properly sizing gas pipe. Longer runs and larger pipe are required to maintain volume and
pressure at the point of use within the allowable pressure drop.

Ampacity Ratings
CE Code Specifications
The ampacity rating of wire conductor cables is specified in the
CE Code.
Rating Factors
Ampacity rating depends on the type of cable, its insulation, and
the maximum temperature to which the cable will be exposed.

Conductor Insulation
Protection
Prevents electric shock and undesirable current flow
Common Materials
Rubber compounds, PVC, and polyethylene plastic
Performance Requirements
Suitable voltage and temperature ratings for application
Conductor insulation is used to prevent the undesirable flow of electric current, such as ground faults and short circuits, and to
protect against electric shock.

*The ampacity of aluminum-sheathed cable is based on the type of insulation used on the copper conductors. Consult the CE
Code for correction factors to be used where there are more than 3 conductors in a cable or raceway
**Maximum allowable conductor temperatures for 1, 2, or 3 conductors run in a raceway or 2 or 3 conductors run in a cable.
***These ratings are based on the use of 90°C insulation on the emerging conductors and for sealing.

Voltage Rating
Identification
A conductor's voltage rating is printed on the insulation.
Dielectric Strength
Electrical conductor insulation subjected to excessive voltage
may break down and lose its insulating ability. The ability of a
conductor's insulation to resist breakdown due to voltage
stress is its dielectric strength.
Voltage ratings are clearly marked on conductor insulation to
ensure proper application and safety.

Temperature Rating
Identification
A conductor's temperature rating is
printed on its outer surface.
Excessive Heat Risks
If an electrical conductor is used in an
application where it is exposed to
excessive heat:
•Its insulation may melt or burn,
leaving the wire conductors bare
•The life expectancy of the insulation
may be greatly reduced
Special Applications
Stove wire, for example, has a high-
temperature-resistant fibre wrapping
over the top of its rubber or thermoplastic
insulation to protect it from the heat of
the appliance it services.

Environmental Considerations
Environmental Assessment
Evaluate the installation environment
Moisture Concerns
Presence of moisture can reduce dielectric strength
Chemical Exposure
Corrosive vapors can damage insulating materials
An electrical conductor used in harmful environments must have insulation that will protect it adequately under those
conditions.

Cable Location Usage
NMD (non-metallic dry)
•For exposed wiring in dry or damp
locations
•For concealed wiring in dry or damp
locations
NMW (non-metallic wet)
•For exposed wiring in dry locations
and in Category 1 and 2 locations,
where not exposed to mechanical
damage
•For exposed wiring in wet locations
•For concealed wiring in dry locations
and in Category 1 and 2 locations
where not exposed to mechanical
damage
Unsheathed conductors
•Run outdoors must be enclosed in a code-compliant raceway

Mechanical Protection
Protection Requirements
The insulation of electrical conductors used in applications where they are exposed to possible physical damage must provide
adequate protection.
Some conductors have an outer layer of flexible metallic sheathing to protect the conductor and its insulation from damage.
For example, in order to prevent damage to conductors in locations where steel joists and studs are used as framing members,
armoured cable (BX) is typically used however NMD cable is permitted when CE Code Rule 12-516, Protection for cable in
concealed installations, is complied with.

Protection for Concealed
Installations
1
Location Requirements
Where the cable is run through or along metal studs, joists,
sheathing, or cladding, it shall be located so as to be effectively
protected from mechanical damage both during and after
installation
2
Passage Protection
Where the cable passes through a member, it shall be protected
by an insert adequately secured in place

Conductor Applications
Power Circuit Wiring
Electrical distribution conductors and
cabling for buildings
Fixture Wiring
Special wiring for lighting fixtures
and equipment
Low-Voltage Control Circuits
Wiring for thermostats, gas valves,
and zone valves
Data Cabling
Infrastructure for
telecommunications and networks
Section 4 of the CE Code provides general rules and reference tables governing the installation and use of electrical
conductors for lighting, appliances, and power supply circuits.

Power Circuit Wiring
Definition
Power circuit wiring is the electrical distribution conductors and
cabling for residential, commercial, and industrial building's
electrical distribution system consists of:
•Service equipment
•Branch circuits
Power circuit wiring forms the backbone of a building's electrical
system, distributing electricity from the main service to various
branch circuits throughout the structure.

Service Equipment
Main Power Source
The service equipment, which uses the largest
conductors, is the main power source for all other
circuit wiring in the building.
Protection Requirements
Service equipment conductors usually require special
mechanical protection, in accordance with Section 6
of the CE Code, and any local bulletins.

Branch Circuits
Power Supply
Branch circuits supply power to receptacle outlets, lighting, heater units, dryers, ranges, and motorized equipment.
Non-metallic Sheathed Cable
Common type used in residential applications
Armoured Cable
Used where mechanical protection is needed
Mineral-insulated Cable
For high-temperature or fire-resistant applications
Conductors in Conduit
For commercial and industrial applications

Fixture Wiring
Definition and Use
Fixture wire is a special type of wire approved for use within electrical equipment
such as lighting fixtures. It is usually a stranded, flexible conductor with high-
temperature rated insulation.
This wire, also known as equipment wire, is used to connect internal fixtures to
branch circuit conductors.
Fixture wiring must withstand the higher temperatures often found inside lighting
fixtures and other electrical equipment.

Low Voltage Control
Circuits
Low Voltage Circuits
The CE Code defines low voltage circuits as those operating from 31
V to 750 V inclusive. Some motor control circuits operate at 600 V.
Conductors used for these types of applications must be rated
accordingly.
Extra-low Voltage Circuits
Extra-low voltage circuits operate at 30 V or less. Residential
thermostat, gas valve, and zone valve control circuits fall into this
category. These circuits generally use cable, No. 16 AWG, or smaller.

Data Cabling
3
Purpose
Data cables and associated
hardware provide sites
telecommunication
infrastructure. Modern gas
equipment is often equipped
network interface device (NID) to
enable them to be connected to
connect to local area networks
(LAN).
Twisted Pair
Most common for short to
medium connections
Cost-effective solution
Coaxial
Used for cable television and
some network applications
Better shielding than twisted pair
Fiber-optic
Used for high-speed, long-
distance connections
Immune to electromagnetic
interference

Twisted Pair Cabling
Advantages
Twisted pair cabling is often used in data networks for short
and medium length connections because of its relatively
lower costs compared to optical fibre and coaxial cable.
Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cable is the most common
cable used in computer networking as the twisting of pair of
conductors in the cable provide shielding from
electromagnetic interference.

twisted pairs of conductors that help reduce
electromagnetic interference.

Shielded Twisted Pair Cables
Types of Shielded Cables
Two other types of twisted pair cables have additional
shielding from high-frequency signals. Such shielding is
done with foil and/or braided metal fibre. The shield can be
applied to individual pair's referred to as shielded twisted-
pair (STP) cable or to a collection of pairs called screened
twisted-pair (ScTP).
Shielded twisted pair cables provide additional protection
against electromagnetic interference through metal
shielding around the wire pairs.

Conductor Colour Codes
Identification Methods
The wires of electrical conductors must be marked for easy identification so they can be correctly
connected in circuits. There are several different methods used to differentiate wiring and two common
methods used to mark wires:
•The insulation of each wire is a different colour.
•The insulation of each conductor may have an attached label marker or wire number (larger cables
have a coloured strip).
Standard Color Codes
ColourUse
White or greyOnly for insulated, neutral conductors or
identified conductors
GreenOnly for insulated grounding or bonding
conductors
Red, black, and blueTypically identifies live (ungrounded)
conductors

Non-metallic Sheathed Cable (NMSC and NMD)
Construction and Use
Non-metallic sheathed cable usually has PVC or
polyethylene plastic insulation, which also serves as the
outer covering of the cable. This type of cable is most
commonly used for wiring branch circuits.
Non-metallic sheathed cable showing the outer jacket and
internal conductors.

Cautions for NMSC and
NMD Cable
Fire Hazards
The non-metallic covering
of electric cables can burn
and may transmit fire when
ignited.
Toxic Emissions
Burning non-metallic
coverings may emit highly
toxic gases that generate
dense smoke.
Corrosion Risk
Acidic gas emissions may corrode metals in the vicinity of the
cables.

Armoured Cable
Description and Use
Armoured cable, also called BX, has a flexible outer metal sheath to protect the
insulated conductors. BX is commonly used in residential, commercial, and industrial
applications where wiring may be exposed to mechanical damage.
CE Code Rules 12-600 to 12-618 cover the requirements for the installation of
armoured cable.
Armoured cable provides superior mechanical protection for electrical conductors in
environments where physical damage is a concern.

Types of Armoured Cable
CableUse
Type ACUse only in dry locations
Type ACLUse where moisture resistance is
required
Has an additional lead covering
Type ACWUUse in wet locations and for
underground installations
Has a thermoplastic outer covering
TECKUse in exposed wiring locations and for
adverse service conditions
Is a special type of armoured cable
Is manufactured in single- and multi-
conductor form, with voltage ratings of
600 V, 1 kV, or 5 kV

TECK Cable
Special Armoured Cable
TECK is a special type of armoured cable used in exposed
wiring locations and for adverse service conditions.
It is manufactured in single- and multi-conductor form, with
voltage ratings of 600 V, 1 kV, or 5 kV.

provides excellent protection in harsh environments.

Aluminum-Sheathed Cable (ASC)
Construction and Types
Aluminum-sheathed cable (ASC) has a seamless aluminum
protective sheath with either a smooth or corrugated finish.
The corrugated type is called RA90 or trade name Corflex. A
PVC outer covering allows the use of ASC in adverse
conditions. ASC is commonly used in industrial applications
requiring voltages of 600 V to 5000 V.
CE Code Table D1 specifies ASC voltage ratings, while CE
Code Rules 12-700 to 12-716 cover the requirements for the
installation of aluminum-sheathed cable, MI cable and
copper-sheathed cable.

providing excellent protection and flexibility.

Mineral-Insulated Cable (MI)
Construction
Mineral-insulated cable has a magnesium oxide filler between
its uninsulated internal conductors and outer metallic sheath,
making it fire-resistant. The outer sheath is usually copper
tubing. This type of cable, often referred to as Pyrotenax, can
withstand severe physical abuse without failing.
Applications
MI cable is used in applications where conductors may be
exposed to mechanical damage, moisture, or high
temperatures. Special termination kits are required for
connecting MI cable because of its uninsulated conductors.
Standard MI cable is certified for circuits up to 600 V. LWMI, a
light-weight cable is used for circuits up to 300 V.

internal conductors separated by mineral insulation.

Flexible Cord and Cable
Usage Limitations
The use of flexible cords and cables is not generally allowed to be used for permanent
wiring installations. They are used to connect appliances and equipment that have
attachment plugs.
Common Types
Three common types of flexible cord and cable include:
•Heater cords
•General-service cords
•Power-supply cables
Code Requirements
CE Code Table 11 and Rules 12-400 to 12-406 specify allowable uses of various
types of flexible cords and cables. Ampacity ratings for these types of
conductors are indicated in CE Code Table 12.

Heater Cord
Characteristics
Heater cord is used to connect portable electric heating units
to outlet receptacles.
It is available with two, three, or four conductors and is usually
insulated with high temperature rated outer jacket.
Maximum voltage rating is 300 V, while conductor sizes range
from No. 18 to No. 14 AWG.
Heater cords must withstand the high temperatures
associated with heating appliances while maintaining their
insulating properties.

General-Service Cord
Construction and Use
General-service cord (also called cab tire) is used to connect
portable appliances and equipment that is subject to hard
usage. This type of cord consists of rubber-insulated
conductors twisted together and is enclosed in a high-grade
rubber outer jacket.
General-service cord is available with two, three, or four
conductors.
Conductor sizes range from No. 18 to No. 10 AWG.

Power-Supply Cables
Construction and Use
Power-supply cable is similar in construction to general
service cord.
It is used for connecting equipment drawing higher currents
at up to 600 V.
It is available with two, three, or four conductors, and in sizes
from No. 8 to No. 2 AWG.

essential for selecting the appropriate conductor with adequate voltage rating.

Conductor Selection Guide
A visual guide to the various types of electrical conductors available for different applications. Proper selection depends on factors such as current
requirements, environmental conditions, mechanical protection needs, and code compliance.

Conductor Installation Methods
Conduit Installation
Conductors installed in rigid or flexible conduit provide excellent mechanical protection and allow for future wire replacement. This method is common in
commercial and industrial applications where exposure to physical damage is likely.
Cable Tray Systems
Cable trays provide support and organization for multiple cables in industrial and commercial settings. They offer good accessibility for maintenance while
protecting cables from physical damage.
Concealed Wiring
Non-metallic sheathed cable or armored cable installed within building cavities is the most common method for residential applications. Protection is required
when passing through framing members.

Conductor Termination Methods
Wire Connectors
Wire nuts and push-in connectors provide a simple method for joining conductors in junction boxes and fixture connections. These are commonly used in
residential and light commercial applications.
Terminal Blocks
Terminal blocks provide secure connection points for multiple conductors, often used in control panels and equipment connections. They offer excellent
organization and accessibility for maintenance.
Lugs and Crimps
For larger conductors, mechanical lugs and crimped connections provide the necessary mechanical strength and electrical continuity. These are common in service
equipment and distribution panels.

Conductor Protection Devices
Fuses
Sacrificial devices that
melt when current
exceeds rating
Circuit Breakers
Resettable protection
devices that trip on
overload
Ground Fault
Circuit Interrupters

to ground and
disconnect circuit
Surge Protectors
Limit voltage spikes
that could damage
insulation
Proper overcurrent protection is essential to prevent conductor overheating and potential fire hazards. The protection device must be
sized according to the conductor's ampacity rating.

Conductor Identification Systems
Color Coding
Standard colors identify conductor function: white/gray for neutral, green for ground, and red/black/blue for ungrounded (hot) conductors. This system provides
visual identification for safe connections.
Wire Markers
Numbered or lettered tags provide unique identification for each conductor in complex systems. These are particularly important in control circuits and industrial
applications with many similar conductors.
Electronic Tracing
Signal generators and receivers allow technicians to identify and trace conductors within walls or underground. This technology is invaluable for troubleshooting
and maintenance in existing installations.

Conductor Safety Considerations
Proper Selection
Choose conductors rated for the application

Correct Installation
Follow code requirements and manufacturer specifications
Adequate Protection
Provide mechanical protection and overcurrent devices
Regular Inspection
Check for damage, overheating, or deterioration
Safety is the primary concern when working with electrical conductors. Proper selection, installation, protection, and maintenance are
essential to prevent electrical hazards such as shock, arc flash, and fire.

Common Conductor Issues
Overheating
Caused by excessive current, poor connections, or inadequate
ventilation. Can lead to insulation breakdown and fire hazards. Proper
sizing and installation practices prevent this issue.
Insulation Damage
Physical damage, UV exposure, or chemical contact can compromise
insulation. Regular inspection and appropriate environmental
protection are essential preventive measures.
Voltage Drop
Long conductor runs can experience significant voltage drop, especially
under load. Upsizing conductors for long runs ensures proper voltage at
the point of use.
Corrosion
Moisture and certain environmental conditions can cause conductor
corrosion, increasing resistance and heat generation. Proper selection
of conductor materials and insulation types for the environment is
critical.

Conductor Testing and Maintenance

Interpret Electrical Drawings
Just as piping drawings provide the gas technician/fitter with a layout of
the piping system, so do electrical drawings provide the gas
technician/fitter with the layout of the electrical system. Having a
working knowledge of the various types of electrical drawings and
electrical symbols is very important as this enables the gas
technician/fitter to understand the entire sequence of operation of the
gas equipment.

Purpose and Objectives
Purpose
Electrical drawings provide the gas technician/fitter with the layout
of the electrical system, enabling them to understand the entire
sequence of operation of the gas equipment.

Technicians
Gas technicians/fitters
must be able to recognize
and interpret these symbols
in order to install and
service equipment properly

It is important for the gas technician/fitter to recognize and interpret the different types of electrical drawings and diagrams used in the
gas industry.

Pictorial Diagrams
Usage
Pictorial diagrams are often used in instruction manuals and
installation guides.
Appearance
Pictorial diagrams are generally three-dimensional and show
components as they would appear in real life.
Component Positioning
Components are located relative to their actual position.
Identification
Wires and other items are identified by colour, value or rating
(although not shown in this example).

Connection Diagrams
Definition
Connection or wiring diagrams are similar to pictorial diagrams, but are not as
detailed.
Key Characteristics
•Components are represented in symbol form rather than as they appear in
reality
•Components are located relative to their actual position
•They attempt to show how the actual wires are connected to the
component terminals
Figure 2-3 is the connection diagram for the circuit shown in Figure 2-2.

Ladder and Schematic Diagrams
Purpose
The purpose of electrical ladder or schematic diagrams is to show how circuits
work and the function of their components.
Sequence
This type of diagram often shows a logical sequence of events.
Representation
Components are represented by standard electrical symbols and are labelled
to indicate such things as their name, type, value, and part number.
Connections
Components are connected by single lines indicating their relationship to
each other in the circuit and are shown in their de-energized state.

Block Diagrams
Definition
A block diagram is a type of flow chart that indicates the
relationship between individual circuits, components or
groups of components within the same housing.
Characteristics
•Components are drawn in the form of blocks
•Components are labelled to indicate such things as their
name, type, value, and part number
•Components are not shown in their actual location in the
circuit
•Components are connected by single lines indicating
their relationship to each other
•Components do not show a return path for the circuit

Block Diagram Example

Representation
In block diagrams, the
components of the circuit are
drawn in the form of blocks,
and their relationship to each
other is indicated by
appropriately connected lines.
Usage
Block diagrams provide a simplified overview of system components
and their relationships without showing detailed connections.

Use of Electrical Drawings
Pictorial Diagrams
Best for recognizing and locating
components on actual appliances
Connection Diagrams
Ideal for finding how wires are
connected between devices
Schematic Diagrams
Shows relationship of components
and circuit operation
Block Diagrams
Provides overview of system
components and relationships
Each of the different types of electrical drawings has advantages and disadvantages. Therefore it is important to select the
appropriate drawing for the activity and often you may require more than one.

Applications of Electrical Drawings
Pictorial Diagrams
The pictorial diagram is helpful for
recognizing and locating components
on the actual appliance as each item is
easily recognized and shown in its
relative position to each other.
Another useful point is that the wiring
colour coding is clearly labelled.
Connection Diagrams
The connection or wiring diagram is a
map of an electrical circuit. It is best
used for finding exactly how and
where wires are connected between
devices. They are also useful for field-
wiring a circuit and for tracing wires
when troubleshooting.
Limitations
Both the pictorial and wiring types of
diagrams can be difficult to use when
trying to understand how a circuit
operates. For example, they don't
show how switches are activated
whether by time, temperature,
pressure or manual operation. Unless
you are familiar with each component,
the order of sequence is impossible to
determine.

Ladder Diagrams
Structure
A schematic or ladder diagram is designed to show the relationship of the components to each other. The ladder diagram gets its
name from its appearance. The two vertical outside lines that make the ladder could be thought of as the rails.
Voltage Representation
Notice in Figure 2-6 they are labelled L1 (Hot) and N (Neutral) representing a 120 alternating voltage potential between them. A
ladder diagram also shows a clear separation of the different voltages above and below the transformer.
Circuit Layout
Separate circuits are shown as rungs of the ladder. Each circuit will then have a source voltage from the left, with one or more
switches and a load.
Reading Technique
It is sometimes easier to read ladder diagrams from right to left identifying each of the loads and the devices that would control
them. Notice the fan motor in Figure 2-6 could be activated by either the manual switch or the temperature activated switch that
closes on a temperature rise.

Thermostatically Controlled
Circuit
Circuit Principles
No matter how simple or complex
the wiring diagram, the principle is
the same - in order for any electrical
function to take place, you must
have a completed circuit. With this
in mind it is important that you are
consistent in regard to what state
the appliance is in when it is drawn.
Switch Representation
Besides just showing what load a
switch will control on the drawing,
the switches/controls are also drawn
in such a way to indicate what
causes them to open or close.
Circuit Completion
For any electrical function to take place, there must be a completed circuit from
power source through control devices to the load and back to the source.

"At Rest" State
Definition
All wiring diagrams are drawn in an "at rest" state (de-energized
state)
Circuit Condition
The circuit's main disconnect device is in the open position
Equipment Status
Any heating or cooling devices connected to the circuit are not
operating or at rest
Component Position
No devices in the circuit are energized or operating, and all devices
and switches are in their normal positions with power off

Switch Positions
A switch drawn in

To say a switch's position is changed remotely could mean indirectly by a
relay. Automatically is usually by way of a mechanical device connected
to the contacts that respond to a change in the environment to which it is
exposed. For example, here is a Temperature Activated Switch (T.A.S.)
that is normally open and will make or close on a drop in temperature.

Remote and Automatic Switching
Remote Switching
To say a switch's position is changed
remotely could mean indirectly by a
relay.
Automatic Switching
Automatically is usually by way of a
mechanical device connected to the
contacts that respond to a change in
the environment to which it is
exposed.
Example
A Temperature Activated Switch
(T.A.S.) that is normally open and will
make or close on a drop in

Wiring Diagram Interpretation
Required Knowledge
Correct interpretation of wiring diagrams and sequences of operation
requires an understanding of certain electrical terms
Control Device
Components that regulate system operation based on various inputs
Factory Wiring
Permanent wiring installed during manufacturing
Field Wiring
Wiring installed by technicians during equipment installation

Control Device Callup
Types of Control Devices
•Temperature controls
•Pressure controls
•Humidity controls
•Flow controls
•Level controls
Diagram Representation
•Represented by symbols
•Identified by position, type
and action
Proper Identification
It would be incorrect to identify a temperature control as a heating
thermostat on a drawing unless it is known for sure that that is its
function. The proper way to identify it would be as "a normally open
temperature control that breaks or opens on temperature rise and closes
on temperature drop"

Control Device States
Normal States
Controls are normally open or normally closed.
Response Triggers
All controls open or close in response to an increase (rise) or
decrease (fall) in:
•Temperature

Furnace Electrical Control Drawings
Diagram Types
In Figure 2-8, you have two separate electrical drawings for a
gas-fired furnace. On the left is a schematic ladder type
diagram, and on the right, you see a wiring diagram.
Circuit State
In these diagrams, the circuit is shown "at rest" with all
switches in their normally open or normally closed positions
depending on their function. For relay contacts, "normal" is the
position with no power on in the circuit.
Field Wiring
Notice the only field wired control is the thermostat.

Troubleshooting with Diagrams
Identify the Problem
If you were troubleshooting the
circulator blower motor, you
would first need to identify
which components control it.
Consult Ladder Diagram
By looking at the ladder
diagram, you could see quite
easily that the blower motor is
simply controlled by a normally
open heat activated fan switch.
Locate Components
To locate that switch, you would
be better off looking at the
wiring diagram where you would
see that it is housed in the same
unit as the limit switch.
Verify Connections
You could also verify the colour
coded wires connected to the
switch using the wiring diagram.

pressure or manual operation
Operational Sequence
Unless you are familiar with each component, the order of sequence is
impossible to determine
Complex Systems
Can become very cluttered and difficult to follow in complex systems

Reading Ladder Diagrams
Identify Power Rails
The two vertical outside lines that make the ladder could be thought of as
the rails, typically labelled L1 (Hot) and N (Neutral)
Examine Circuit Rungs
Separate circuits are shown as rungs of the ladder, each with a source
voltage from the left, with one or more switches and a load
Read Right to Left
It is sometimes easier to read ladder diagrams from right to left
identifying each of the loads and the devices that would control
them
Understand Switch Functions
Switches/controls are drawn to indicate what causes them to
open or close

Proper Control Device Identification
Incorrect Identification
It would be incorrect to identify a
temperature control as a heating
thermostat on a drawing unless it is
known for sure that that is its function.
Correct Identification
The proper way to identify it would be
as "a normally open temperature
control that breaks or opens on
temperature rise and closes on
temperature drop"

Measuring and Test
Instruments
A gas technician/fitter must be capable of solving problems on a regular
basis. In many cases, these problems will be electrical ones. Solving these
problems requires a thorough knowledge of the system and the tools
required to determine where the problems lie. This means that the gas
technician/fitter must be familiar with the various types of electrical
measuring and test devices, as well as how and where they are applied.

Purpose of Electrical Testing Equipment
Safety First
When working with electrical testing equipment, gas technicians/fitters must protect themselves from electrical hazards. Reviewing
Unit 1 Safety is recommended.
For information on the basic selection, use, and maintenance of common electrical testing and measuring instruments, refer to Unit 5
Introduction to electricity, Chapter 7. Electrical measuring instruments.
Safety is the single most important concern when working on electrical equipment. All workers must be trained to use the equipment in
analyzing or troubleshooting problems with gas-fired systems. Never work on live electrical unless you have been trained and
authorized by your employer.

VOMElectronic
measuring
instrument that
combines several
functions in one
unit

Types of Measuring and Test Instruments
Analog Instruments
Analog instruments indicate measured values with a scale and pointer
display. The pointer's movement is directly and continuously related to the
measured quantity.
Digital Instruments
Digital instruments interpret the measured quantity electronically in
discrete numerical data (digits). They have a numerical display that is
formed by light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or liquid crystal displays (LCDs).

Digital Multimeter (DMM)
Multiple Functions
A digital multimeter (DMM) combines the functions of a voltmeter, an ammeter,
and an ohmmeter.
Advanced Features
Digital multimeters also have advanced features that vary among DMM models
from different manufacturers.
Function Dial
The function dial normally has positions that will allow a technician to measure AC
volts, DC volts, DC amps, and resistance.
Additional Capabilities
Some DMMs have function switch positions that will allow a technician to measure
AC amps and to test diodes and capacitors.

Voltage Functions of DMM
Measuring Electrical Potential
Electrical potential and voltage are measured in volts (V) or
millivolts (mV).
The voltage function measures the difference in electric
potential between two points in a circuit.
Types of Voltage Sources
AC voltage: Current flow changes in both magnitude and
direction at regular intervals.
DC voltage: Current flow does not change direction.

Applications of Voltage
Measurement
AC Voltage Function
Commonly used to test and
troubleshoot receptacles, gas
appliance power supply,
transformers, and other AC control
circuits.
DC Voltage Function
Used to test battery banks and to
troubleshoot DC motors, DC
generators and other DC circuits.
Millivolt Function
Some DMM may have a dedicated DC millivolt setting that is more accurate than
the DC autorange voltage function. This function is useful for testing very low
millivolt systems such as thermocouples.

Ammeter Function
Measuring Current Flow
Electric current flow is measured in amperes (A),
milliamperes (mA), or microamperes (μA). The word
"ampere" is commonly shortened to "amp".
The DMM has a setting for AC and DC current. Most DMMs
can measure DC or AC currents from the micro-amp range
to a maximum of 10 amps.
For higher amperage circuits, a clamp-on ammeter is
recommended.

Clamp-On Ammeter
Purpose and Design
Clamp-on ammeters are designed to eliminate the need to
interrupt circuit operation to measure current in the circuit.
Clamp-on meters are generally used to measure alternating
current or direct current only, but some digital clamp-on
meters will measure AC and DC, as well as voltage and
resistance.

Advantages of Clamp-On Ammeter
Minimal Circuit Loading
It causes minimal circuit loading
because it is not connected in
series with the load.
No External Shunts
It does not require the use of
external shunts, as some in-line
ammeters do.
Durability
It is generally more rugged than
an in-line ammeter.

Ohmmeter Function
Measuring Resistance
Any circuit with an ability to conduct some electrical current
is said to have electrical continuity. The amount of
resistance there is to current flow is measured in ohms (Ω) or
kilohms (kΩ).
The ohmmeter function can be used to measure both
resistance and continuity in a circuit.
An ohmmeter function is powered by a small battery that
causes current flow through the tested circuit's resistance,
therefore a DMM set for ohms must not be used on an
energized circuit.

Applications of Ohmmeter
Testing Fuses
A DMM set for ohms can be
used to test the continuity of a
fuse. The resistance of a faulty
fuse would indicate OL
(infinity) on the display.
Testing Switches
A DMM set for ohms can be
used to test the continuity of a
switch. The resistance of an
open switch would indicate OL
(infinity) on the display, and a
closed switch would indicate a
very small resistance value.
Safety Note
Never use an ohmmeter on an energized circuit as it can damage the
meter and potentially cause injury.

Specialized Meters: Megohmmeter
Purpose and Function
An Insulation resistance tester also called a megohmmeter
is used for measuring the resistance of electrical insulation
in, for example, motor and transformer windings.
It measures values in the 20 kilohm to 2000 megohm range.
The component being tested is disconnected from the
circuit and the megohmmeter leads connected (one to the
frame and one to the windings).

Using a Megohmmeter
Disconnect Component
The component or apparatus being tested is disconnected from the
circuit.
Connect Leads
Connect megohmmeter leads (one to the frame and one to the
windings).
Apply Voltage
The instrument applies a DC voltage to the component.
Take Readings
The insulation value is read at 30 seconds and again at 1 minute
after being connected. If the insulation is in good condition, the
value will increase slowly. The reading taken at 1 minute should
be higher than the one taken at 30 seconds.

Specialized Meters: Capacitor Analyzer
Purpose and Function
Unlike an ohmmeter, which only indicates if a capacitor has capacitance, a capacitor analyzer can test
actual capacitance.
Its principal function is the detection of current leakage that would normally only be obvious during
circuit operation. It can also detect if a capacitor is open or shorted-out.
Capacitor testers come in many different types and designs. Stand-alone testers may have a digital
read-out or bar graph, while some just have LED indicators. Frequently, digital multimeters now have
the ability to test most capacitors used with gas-fired equipment.

Operation and Connection of
Measuring Instruments
Read Instructions
Always read the manufacturer's operation and maintenance instructions
for testing instruments and equipment prior to use.
Seek Clarification
If you are unsure of how to use them, contact your supervisor for
clarification.
Safety First
Safety is the single most important concern when working on electrical
equipment.
Use PPE
Always wear the required personal protective equipment.

Safety Awareness Before Testing
Presence of Electricity
Never trust that the power has been switched off. Always measure the voltage
before working on any equipment or wiring.
Lockout/Tag Out
Follow proper lockout/tag out procedures to ensure equipment cannot be
energized during work.
Grounding
Understand and follow proper grounding procedures to prevent electrical hazards.
System Potential
Be aware of system potential energy or category of short-circuit current.

Meter Condition and Testing
1
Inspect for Visible
Damage
Check the meter housing for
cracks or other damage that
could compromise safety.
2
Inspect Test Leads
Visually inspect the test lead
insulation, probe, and
connection for wear or damage.
3
Test Lead Resistance
Perform a resistance test of the
leads to confirm they are reliable
and well connected.
4
Zero Adjustment
Ensure the meter is properly zeroed before taking
measurements.
5
Test on Known Source
Test the meter and leads on a known source before
using them to test a circuit or component to ensure
that the meter is working properly.

Measuring Voltage
Connection Method
To measure voltage, a voltmeter must be connected across
the two points in the circuit where the voltage appears.
AC and DC digital voltmeters must be connected in parallel
with the device or circuit being tested.

Measuring Current: In-line Ammeter
Fuse Protection
Most digital multimeters are protected by fuses on the
current measuring scales. These fuses help prevent injury
and protect the meter from damage.
If a fuse is damaged and requires replacement, it must be
replaced with one specified by the manufacturer to provide
proper protection.
To measure current with an in-line ammeter, the circuit
must be broken at the point where the current is to be
measured and the ammeter inserted in series.

Measuring Current: Clamp-On Ammeter
Open the Jaws
Open the jaws of the ammeter by squeezing the handle.
Close Around Conductor
Close the jaws over the conductor.
Ensure Single Conductor
Ensure that only one conductor is enclosed in the jaws. If the live and neutral conductors are both enclosed by the jaws, the meter will read zero.
Check Jaw Closure
Ensure that the jaws of the ammeter are completely closed. If the contact points of the jaws are dirty or obstructed and do not make good contact, the reading will be inaccurate.
Read Display
The current reading will be indicated on the ammeter display.

Measuring Resistance
Connection Method
An ohmmeter is used to measure resistance.
The ohmmeter is connected across the unpowered device
or circuit. To protect the ohmmeter, it is best if you isolate
the devices being tested from the circuit.
Never measure resistance on a powered circuit as this can
damage the meter.

Common Symbols on Digital Meters
The digital meter has a display where numbers appear to indicate the numeric value of the electrical quantity being measured.
The digital meter also uses symbols on the display, switch, and connections.

Reading Digital Multimeter Displays
Numerical Display
The digital meter has a display where numbers appear to
indicate the numeric value of the electrical quantity being
measured.
The digital meter also uses symbols on the display, switch,
and connections to indicate different functions and settings.
Bar Graph
The bar graph on a DMM reacts like the needle on an
analogue meter.
The bar graph responds faster than the numerical reading,
which can help identify problems caused by loose
connections.

Testing Circuits with a
Multimeter
Electrical Troubleshooting
Many service calls are for problems of an electrical nature. To quickly
identify the circuits affected and accurately troubleshoot the
problem requires the use of a multimeter.
Safety Warning
Caution: Testing circuits may require working with live voltage. Use
extreme caution when doing any live testing.

Fan Circuit Testing
Circuit Diagram
Figure 3-11 is a diagram of a 120 V fan circuit associated with
a forced-warm-air furnace.

Fan Circuit Testing: Step 1
Check Appliance Disconnect Switch

Verify Neutral
Verify that the reading between N and ground is 0 V.

Fan Circuit Testing: Step 3
Open Disconnect Switch
Open the disconnect switch.
Retake L1 to Ground Reading
Verify that the reading between L1 and ground is 0 V.
Retake N to Ground Reading
Verify that the reading between N and ground is also 0 V.
Verify Disconnect Function
These readings should verify that the disconnect switch is
located on the L1 or hot line and that it shuts off power to the
unit.

Fan Circuit Testing: Step 4
Measure Source Voltage
The second reading on this circuit determines the source
voltage between L1 and N.
1.Set the meter to the proper voltage scale.
2.Take a reading between L1 and N.
3.Verify that the meter indicates 120 V.

Fan Circuit Testing: Step 5
Measure Across Fan Switch
Take a reading across the terminals of
the open fan switch.
Verify Open Switch Voltage
Verify that the reading is 120 V when
the switch is open.
Verify Closed Switch Voltage
Verify that the reading across the fan
switch is 0 V when the fan switch
closes.

Fan Circuit Testing: Step 6
Measure Across Motor Terminals
Take a reading across the motor terminals when the fan switch is
open.
Verify Open Switch Reading
Verify that the reading is 0 V when the switch is open.
Verify Closed Switch Reading
Verify that, when the fan switch closes to energize the motor,
the reading is 120 V.

Transformer Circuit Testing
Circuit Description
Figure 3-13 shows the line voltage circuit to the high limit
(optional location) and step-down transformer.
•If you take a reading with meter A, it indicates a source
voltage of 120 V.
•Meter B indicates a reading of 0 V if the high limit is
closed. If it is open, it should read 120 V.
•Meter C indicates 24 V on the secondary side of the
transformer or slightly higher if there is no load
connected.

Control Circuit Testing
Circuit Description
Figure 3-14 shows the 24 V control circuit for a forced
warm-air furnace. It consists of a 24 V AC power supply, a
three-terminal gas valve, and a thermostat.

Control Circuit Meter Readings
Meter A: Source Voltage
Indicates the source voltage to
be 24 V. If there were no load on
the transformer, it would read 26
or 27 V. Once the control circuit
is energized, the voltage at A
should return to 24 V.
Meter B: Thermostat
Placed across the terminals of
the thermostat. With the
thermostat switch contacts in
the open position (no call for
heat), the meter should read 24
V. Once the thermostat contacts
close on a call for heat, the meter
should read 0 V.
Meter C: Gas Valve
Placed to read the voltage drop
across the coil of the gas valve.
When the thermostat contacts
are open and not calling for heat,
the meter should read 0 V. When
the thermostat contacts are
closed and calling for heat, the
meter should read 24 V.

Circuits and Hardware
Knowing how and from where electricity is supplied helps the gas
technician/fitter install and maintain gas equipment. Whether the source
is an electrical panel, a junction box, or a transformer, a basic knowledge
of the relevant hardware and circuitry is important.
It should be noted that electricians are required to perform electrical
work under a permit in all jurisdictions in Canada. Gas technicians/fitters
should check with the local electrical authority having jurisdiction (AHJ)
for requirements. Gas and mechanical trades are permitted to perform
elementary electrical work in some Canadian jurisdictions.

Residential Electrical
Service
The electrical service coming into a residential distribution panel is 240
volts M, single-phase, 60 hertz (240/1/60). The service conductors
consist of:
Two Live Conductors
Also known as "line wires"
that carry the electrical
current
Neutral Conductor
Completes the circuit and is
permitted to be grounded
only once
Grounding Conductor
Connects the neutral and the metal distribution panel to a
grounding electrode

Branch Circuits
The 240 V supply coming into a building is divided into branch circuits at the distribution panel. Branch circuits are 240 V or
120 V, depending on the characteristics of the circuit they supply.
240 V Circuits
Protected by two-pole breakers
•A double overcurrent that feeds two ungrounded (live)
branch circuit conductors coming into the panel
•May or may not have a neutral conductor
•A bonding conductor connected to metallic panel box by
means of a bonding bus
120 V Circuits
Protected by single-pole breakers
•A single overcurrent that feeds an ungrounded (live)
branch circuit conductor coming into the panel
•An identified conductor from the neutral bar in the panel
•A bonding conductor connected to metallic panel box by
means of a bonding bus

Bonding Requirements
Continuous Bond
Requirement
All line-voltage circuits must
have a continuous bond
running from the main
distribution panel to each
junction box, receptacle, and
appliance.
CE Code Requirement
The CE Code states that non-
current-carrying conductive
parts of electrical equipment
shall be connected to a
bonding conductor.
240 V Branch Circuits
240 V branch circuits may have a neutral conductor included in the
wiring run. This is necessary if the equipment has any 120 V
components (e.g., lights).

Combination Panel and
Schematic
The figure shows a combination panel and schematic, illustrating branch
circuit connections. This diagram helps gas technicians understand how
electrical power is distributed from the main panel to various branch
circuits that may supply gas equipment.
Understanding this schematic is essential for properly connecting gas
appliances to the electrical system and for troubleshooting electrical
issues that may affect gas equipment operation.

Control Circuit Transformers
Some gas appliance control circuits and other electrical devices operate at lower voltages than 120 V. The voltage for control
devices is usually 24 V AC (typical residential appliance control voltage). A 240/24 or 120/24 step-down transformer is
required to obtain the necessary 24 V supply.
Core of Iron Plates
Separated by insulation to create
the transformer core
Primary Winding
Connected to the 120 V supply
Secondary Winding
Connected to the 24 V appliance
control circuit

Transformer Operation
A typical step-down transformer consists of a core of iron plates
separated by insulation, a primary winding, and a secondary winding. The
120 V supply is connected to the primary winding terminals of the
transformer and the appliance control circuit connected to the 24 V
secondary winding terminals.
The 120 V alternating current flow through the primary winding induces a
24 V current in the secondary winding to power the appliance control
circuit. It is important to make sure transformers are bonded by a
bonding conductor to the cabinet bond. This is critical for
troubleshooting.

Transformer Ratings
Voltage Ratings
Manufacturers always specify the
voltage rating of a transformer's
primary and secondary windings.
Secondary winding rated voltages
are specified for full-load
conditions with the rated primary
voltage.
Operating Considerations
Operating a transformer's primary
at higher than rated voltage may
cause the transformer to overheat,
damaging its insulation. Operating
the primary at lower than rated
voltage does no harm, but
secondary voltages will be less
than rated values.
Current Ratings
Current ratings are generally specified for secondary windings only. If the
secondary current rating is not exceeded, the primary current capacity
cannot be exceeded.

Transformer Power Ratings
Volt-Ampere (VA) Rating
The volt-ampere rating of a transformer is the product of
the voltage and amperage (VA = V x A).
This rating indicates the capacity of the transformer to
handle electrical load.
Power Rating in Watts
A power rating specified in watts is understood to be the
power that a transformer can deliver to a resistive load.
The power rating in watts is the product of the current rating
and the voltage rating of the secondary winding (P = E x I).
Some transformers are fused internally. If there is no indication of fusing, it is good practice to include fusing when replacing or
installing new transformers. New equipment usually has the transformer integral to the main circuit board, which may be
equipped with a fuse.

Transformer Diagram Representations
Transformers are indicated on electrical diagrams in two ways, as shown in the figure. Understanding these diagram symbols is
essential for gas technicians when reading electrical schematics for gas appliances that incorporate control transformers.
The second representation of a transformer is shown below:

Electrical Hardware Overview
In order to properly install and service gas appliances and equipment, gas technicians/fitters must be able to identify and use
the following types of electrical hardware:
Connection Devices
Used to join electrical conductors safely
Switches, Relays, and Contactors
Used to control electrical circuits
Boxes
Provide safe enclosures for electrical connections
Sockets and Plugs
Connect equipment to power sources
Fasteners
Secure electrical components in place
Conduit or Raceways
Protect electrical conductors

Connection Devices
The CE Code requires that all connections be made only in outlet or junction boxes. The electrical connections used for the
installation of gas appliances and equipment fall into two basic groups:
Solderless Terminals and Insulators
•Crimp-on-type connectors
•Insulated cap-type connectors
Soldered Connections
•Joined mechanically first
•Then soldered for electrical security
•Provides excellent electrical connection

Crimp-on Connectors
Crimp-on connectors are used to secure twisted and untwisted wire
joints. This type of connector can be a slip-on metal cap for pig-tail
joints, or a metal sleeve for splicing two straight wires.
The two-part connector shown in the figure has a conductor retaining
sleeve that is compressed by using special crimping pliers and an
insulated screw cap into which the crimped retainer is inserted.

Insulated Cap Connectors
Types of Connectors
There are several types of insulated-cap connectors. Also known as wire nut connectors
or marrettes by the manufacturer Marr. This type of connector is used for pig-tail joints
of two or more conductors.
The two most common insulated-cap connectors are the twist-on type and the set-
screw type. They are both available in several colour coded sizes to accommodate a wide
range of conductors.
Connector Construction
The set-screw connectors consist of a brass connector body and an insulated cap. The
twisted conductors are slid into the brass connector body and secured with the hold-
down screw before the plastic insulating cap is screwed in place.
Twist-on connectors have a cone-shaped coiled wire insert that grips the twisted
conductors to ensure good electrical contact. When the connector is twisted onto the
stripped end of the wires, the wire is drawn and squeezed into the metal insert.

Connector Installation Best Practices
Follow Instructions
Follow the instructions that are included with each type of connector to ensure the
connector is correctly joining the wire.
Periodic Maintenance
It is good practice to check these connectors periodically to tighten them if required since
expansion and contraction loosen them over time.
Proper Wire Stripping
Ensure wires are stripped to the correct length as specified by the connector manufacturer.
Secure Connections
Make sure all connections are tight and secure to prevent arcing and potential fire hazards.

Modular Connectors
Modular connectors were originally designed for use in telephone wiring but have since been used for many other purposes. Many applications that originally used a bulkier, more expensive connector have
converted to modular connectors. Probably the best-known applications of modular connectors are for telephone and Ethernet.
Connector Design
Modular connectors are designed to latch together. As a
plug is inserted into a jack, a plastic tab on the plug locks so
that the plug cannot be pulled out. To remove the plug, the
latching tab must be depressed against the plug to clear the
locking edge.
Connector Designation
Modular connectors are designated using two numbers that
represent the maximum number of contact positions and
number of installed contacts, with each number followed by
P and C, respectively. For example, 6P2C is a connector
having six positions, and two installed contacts.
Connector Sizes
Modular connectors are manufactured in four sizes, with 4-,
6-, 8-, and 10-positions.

8P8C Connector
The 8-position, 8-contact (8P8C) connector is a modular connector
commonly used to terminate category 5 (Cat5e) cable, which is
commonly used for Ethernet over twisted pair.
Internally, the contacts on the plugs have sharp prongs that, when
crimped, pierce the wire insulation and connect with the conductor.
The registered jack specifications define the wiring patterns of the jacks
so the termination of cables similar across the various number of
positions and contacts in the plug. The crimping tool contains a die that
is often exchangeable and is closely matched to the shape and pin count
of the modular plug.

Modular Connector Crimping
Tool
It is important to follow the proper termination procedure when terminating
a cable in a modular plug as the order is important.
The crimping tool shown in the image is designed specifically for modular
connectors. The tool ensures proper connection between the wires and the
connector contacts.

Soldered Connections
Best Joining Method
Soldering is probably the best
method for joining circuit
conductors. However, it takes
longer and requires more
equipment than other methods.
CE Code Requirement
Rule 12-112 in the CE Code:
Soldered splices shall first be
spliced or joined so as to be
mechanically and electrically secure
without solder and then be
soldered.
Proper Technique
Ensure proper mechanical
connection before applying solder
to create a reliable electrical
connection.

Switches Overview
A switch is a device that opens or closes an electrical circuit. It has two positions: open and closed.
Proper Placement
Switches are always located in the
(ungrounded) or live conductor of
the circuit, never in the (grounded)
neutral, or identified conductor.
Series Circuit Operation
Electricity cannot flow through a
series control circuit unless all
switches are closed, and the circuit
is complete. If even one of the
switches is open, the circuit cannot
conduct electrical current.
Rating Importance
All switches are rated for the
amount of current that can flow
through them. Always ensure that
the switch is rated at or above the
circuit current flow and voltage.

Switch Terminology
Switches are designated by the number of poles and throws they have. When a switch is thrown, the pole is moved to another
position. A throw is, therefore, one position of the pole.
Pole
A pole refers to the number of separate circuits that can be
controlled by a switch. A single-pole switch controls one
circuit, while a double-pole switch controls two separate
circuits.
Throw
A throw refers to the number of positions each pole can be
connected to. A single-throw switch has one "on" position,
while a double-throw switch can connect to either of two
positions.

Single Pole, Single Throw
Switch
The simplest switch is a single pole, single throw (SPST) switch. This
means the switch has one pole and one contact.
This type of switch is commonly used for simple on/off control of a single
circuit, such as a light switch in a home. When the switch is in the "on"
position, current flows through the circuit. When the switch is in the "off"
position, the circuit is open and no current flows.

Single Pole, Double Throw
Switch
If another contact is added to a SPST switch, the switch becomes a single
pole, double throw (SPDT) switch.
The pole can be thrown to one of two positions, energizing one of two
different circuits or loads. This type of switch is often used in applications
where a single input needs to be directed to one of two possible outputs.

DIP Switches
Manufacturers often want to group together multiple SPST switches into one package. They are called dual in-line package
(DIP) switches and are used on printed circuit boards to customize the behaviour of an appliance controller for specific
situations.
DIP switches allow for configuration changes without requiring reprogramming or circuit modifications. They are commonly
found in gas appliance control boards to set operating parameters or enable/disable specific features.

Double Pole, Single Throw
Switch
Some household appliances require 240 V. In this case, two poles each
carrying 120 V are linked mechanically to move together.
This type of switch is called a double pole, single throw (DPST) switch.
The poles are connected to two separate ungrounded conductors called
L1 and L2. The poles make and break two independent circuits at the
same time.
A common use of a DPST switch is the disconnect switch on a window air
conditioner.

Double Pole, Double Throw
Switch
If another throw is added to the DPST switch, it becomes a double pole,
double throw (DPDT) switch.
The poles can make contact in two positions. This type of switch allows
for more complex control scenarios, such as reversing the direction of a
motor or switching between two different power sources.

Switch Operation
Switches can be operated by hand or be actuated in response to changes in temperature, fluid movement, and pressure. Each
of these conditions creates a force that moves the poles to the opposite position.
Normally Open Switch
For a switch designated as normally open, the force moves
the pole to close the circuit.
These switches are used when the default state should be
"off" and the circuit should only be energized when the
actuating condition is present.
Normally Closed Switch
For a switch designated as normally closed, the force moves
the pole to open the circuit.
These switches are used when the default state should be
"on" and the circuit should be de-energized when the
actuating condition is present, such as in safety circuits.

Motor-Starting Switches
Electric motors use various types of starting switches. Two switches in
common use are the toggle switch and push-button switch.
Toggle Switch
Provides simple on-off control with a lever mechanism
Push-Button Switch
Uses separate buttons for start and stop functions
Overload Protection
Many motor switches include thermal overload protection
Horsepower Rating
Motor switches have contacts rated for the high inrush current of
motors

Toggle Starter Switch
The toggle motor-starter is a snap-action switch, providing simple on-
off control. It may consist of one contact (single pole) or two contacts
(double pole). A toggle lever on the front of the starter operates the
contacts. A thermal overload device may be next to the contact
assembly.
This manual starter may be mounted in a standard switchbox installed on
the wall and covered with a standard switch plate. The ON and OFF
positions are clearly marked on the lever, and the switch is similar in
appearance to a standard lighting switch.

Toggle Switch Features
Horsepower-Rated Contacts
The main difference is that the motor starting switch has horsepower-rated contacts,
which means that it can safely interrupt the inrush current or locked-rotor current of
the motor.
Overload Protection
It also may contain overload protection for sensing higher-than-normal currents drawn
by the motor.
Series Connection
The starter is connected in series with the supply line and the motor terminals so that it
can switch current to the motor.
Compact Design
The compact construction of this manual starter switch allows it to be installed directly
on driven machinery and in tight spaces.

Toggle Switch Overload Operation
Current Increase
If a motor overload occurs,
line current to the motor
increases.
Heater Element
Activation
This causes a small heater
element to warm up
considerably.
Switch Trip
This heating automatically
trips the switch contacts,
which breaks the circuit.
Reset Procedure
After a cooling period, the
toggle is reset by pulling
down the switch lever and
then switching on again.

Push-Button Starter Switch
Push-button starters are similar in operating principle to toggle switches,
except that they use two separate buttons to activate contacts.
The figure shows an external view of a push-button, manual starter in the
on (START) position. To switch the motor on, press the START button so
that it moves inward and stays there.
A mechanical interlocking device forces the STOP button outward so
that it projects beyond the START button. Once activated, these buttons
remain in position until the opposite button is pressed. To turn the motor
off, press the STOP button in so that the START button moves out again.

Relays
A relay is a magnetically operated switch that operates on the solenoid principle. It can have multiple sets of contacts, which can be open or closed. A solenoid, which is basically a coil of wire wound
around an iron core, converts electrical energy to linear motion.
Current Flow
When current flows through the coil of the solenoid, a
magnetic field develops in the core.
Magnetic Attraction
The magnetic field, which is stronger than the spring
holding the movable armature away from the iron core,
attracts the armature.
Contact Operation
In the "at rest" position, the movable contact connected
to the armature is in contact with one of two stationary
contacts. This set of contacts is normally closed. When
the magnetic field pulls the armature towards the iron
core, the armature breaks contact with one stationary
contact and makes contact with the other.

Control Relays
Control relays are electrically operated switches that use electromagnets or solenoids to open and/or close several different circuits at the same time. The contacts are rated for light
duty and usually carry only very small amounts of current as is usually the case for the components of control circuits.
Primary Use
These switches are primarily used to isolate control voltage from line voltage.
Control relays are not suited for controlling even single-phase motors of any size
because of the high inductance and low resistance that cause high-starting currents
when starting and high back-currents when contacts are opened for stopping.
Relay Construction
The T-bar of the armature is seen at the bottom in Figure 4-16(a). The bottom sets of
contacts are normally closed, as shown in detail in Figure 4-16(b).
When the solenoid is activated, the armature moves upward, opening the bottom
contacts and closing the upper contacts. The armature is insulated from the electrical
contacts.

Contactors
The term relay is often used to describe any type of magnetically operated switch. A relay is actually a control device that
contains small contacts designed to operate only low-current loads.
A contactor is very similar to a relay, except that a contactor contains heavy duty contacts designed to control larger amounts
of current. This heavier contactor allows for a low voltage to control a component with a higher voltage and current draw. In
some cases, it may even be a separate circuit being supplied to the component.

Contactor Applications
Heating Applications
In the heating and air-conditioning field, contactors are often used to connect
power to resistance heater banks.
Contact Types
Contactors may contain auxiliary contacts as well as load contacts.
Motor Starters
Motor starters are basically contactors with the addition of overload relays.
Motor Starter Components
Motor starters generally contain auxiliary contacts, which are used as part of the
control circuit, and load contacts, which are used to connect the motor to the
line.

Heavy-Duty Contactors
Heavy-duty contactors are solenoid/armature operators for switching
heavy-duty electrical contacts. They are used to control the large
amounts of current and high voltages required by industrial equipment.
The figure shows a contactor that might be used to turn on a three-phase
motor on a large boiler.
Note that the insulators that hold the conductive crossbars are attached
to the T-bar armature that closes several sets of contacts at once.

Heavy-Duty Contactor
Schematic
The schematic shows the switch in the 110 V coil circuit, which
simultaneously activates the 208 V three-phase circuit to the motor.
Most three-phase heavy duty motors require an overload sensing circuit
to protect the motor from single-phase conditions and excessive current
draw due to high load demands. This requires the use of a motor starter,
usually a magnetic motor starter. However, more electronic versions are
becoming common in addition to variable frequency drive controllers.

Three-Phase Magnetic
Starter
The figure shows a typical three-phase magnetic starter. These starters
combine contactor functionality with overload protection specifically
designed for three-phase motor applications.
Understanding these components is important for gas technicians
working on equipment with three-phase motors, such as large
commercial boilers or industrial heating systems.

Electrical Boxes Overview
Many types and sizes of electrical boxes are available to meet the
requirements of various applications. Variations include different depths,
widths, heights, capacities, mounting bracket, and cable clamp
arrangements.
Section 12 of the CE Code prescribes the requirements for the use and
installation of electrical boxes and their accessories. The two boxes
commonly used in the installation of gas appliances and equipment are
device boxes and junction boxes.
Boxes must always have the covers installed after wiring.

Device Boxes
Device boxes can be used to support switches and other devices. There are two basic types: gangable type and non-gangable type.
Non-Gangable Type
These boxes have fixed sides and cannot be combined with other
boxes.
The figure shows a non-gangable device box (2-gang).
Gangable Type
One side of a gangable device box can be removed to allow one or
more additional boxes to be added or ganged to it.
This allows for flexibility in creating multi-gang boxes for multiple
switches or devices.

Sectional Gangable Box
The CE Code requires any gas appliance that is connected to an electrical
circuit to have an electrical disconnect switch. The switch, which must be
mounted near the appliance in an approved electrical switch box, is used
to shut off electrical power during emergencies or when the appliance is
being serviced.
Take care when placing a switch box that you will use for disconnecting
the furnace from the circuit. The CE Code requires that the switch for
disconnection be located between the furnace and the point of entry to
the room containing the furnace if the switch is a branch circuit breaker
in the distribution panel board.

Disconnect Switch Requirements
Proper Placement
You must not have to pass close to the furnace to reach
the switch, and it must not be placed on the furnace
itself.
Clear Marking
The switch must be clearly marked with the circuit it
controls.
Safety Purpose
Allows for quick power disconnection during
emergencies or maintenance.
Code Compliance
Must meet all requirements of the Canadian Electrical
Code.

Junction Boxes
There are two types of electrical boxes commonly used as junction
boxes: octagon boxes and square boxes.
A junction box is often mounted directly on a gas appliance. In most
installations, the connections between the branch circuit supplying the
appliance and the appliance control system are made in the junction box.
This is done to meet CE Code requirements and prevent short circuits
and electric shock hazards.

Octagon Boxes
Octagon boxes are usually used to support lighting fixtures or as junction points for wiring connections. They may also be used
as switch or outlet boxes when equipped with special cover plates.
These boxes provide a secure enclosure for electrical connections and help prevent electrical hazards when properly installed
and covered.

Square Boxes
Square boxes are used primarily as junction boxes for surface-run and concealed wiring circuits. Square boxes are available in two sizes.
4 Inch Wide Box
Most commonly used
Can be fitted with special covers that permit its use for switches, receptacles and pilot lights
4-11/16 Inch Square Box
Generally used for range or dryer receptacles
Provides more space for larger conductors and connections

Sockets and Plugs
Some gas appliances and equipment installations require the use of
special sockets (receptacles) and plugs. Occasionally, a gas appliance
may be supplied with the necessary cable and plug, and the gas
technician/fitter will only be required to select the appropriate receptacle
assembly.
In some cases, it may be necessary for the technician/fitter to determine
the equipment requirements and specifications from the manufacturer's
installation instructions and select the appropriate cable, plug, and
socket.
Be sure to check with the electrical AHJ regarding requirements on cable
and cord end installations.

Locking and Non-Locking Plugs
Specialty plugs and sockets can be either locking or non-locking.
Non-Locking Plug
Is inserted straight into its socket, relying on contact friction to keep it
securely in place
Can be withdrawn by pulling it straight out of the socket
Locking Plug
Is inserted straight into its socket, then rotated clockwise a short distance to
lock it into the socket
Cannot be withdrawn from the socket unless it is first rotated counter-
clockwise

Plug and Socket
Configurations
Each type of plug and socket assembly has different socket and terminal
blade configurations and voltage and current ratings based on the
intended application.
The configuration chart shows various receptacle socket configurations
for different voltage and amperage ratings. These configurations are
standardized to prevent connecting equipment to incompatible power
sources.
For configurations 6-15R, 6-20R, 6-20RA, 6-30R, and 6-50R, Y denotes
the identified terminal when used on circuits derived from three-phase,
4-wire 416V circuits.

Receptacle Terminal
Designations
G Terminal
Represents the terminal for bonding to ground
W Terminal
Represents the identified terminal
X, Y, and Z Terminals
Represent the terminals for ungrounded conductors
Configuration Purpose
These standardized configurations ensure proper connections and prevent
equipment damage from incorrect power connections

Electrical Fasteners
Electrical cable and conduit must be secured to building framing and wall
and ceiling surfaces in accordance with CE Code requirements. The
figure shows some of the fasteners commonly used for this purpose.
Proper fastening of electrical components is essential for safety and code
compliance. Gas technicians should be familiar with these fasteners
when installing or servicing gas equipment with electrical connections.

Conduit and Tubing
Overview
Electrical conduit and tubing are used to contain and protect the
electrical conductors of a circuit. Conduit and tubing are classified by
wall thickness, mechanical stiffness, and material they are made from.
The CE Code, Part 1 covers the requirements for the installation of
electrical conduit and tubing depending on the type of equipment,
location, or hazard.

Types of Conduit and Tubing
Rigid Metal Conduit (RMC)
Made to the same dimensions as standard pipe
Electrical Metallic Tubing (EMT)
A thin-walled metal tubing
Rigid PVC Conduit
A rigid non-metallic conduit
Flexible Metallic Conduit (FMC)
Easily bent without the use of tools
Liquid-tight Flexible Metallic Conduit (LFMC)
Waterproof flexible conduit for wet locations

Conduit Selection Factors
Environment
Consider whether the installation location is dry, wet, or
corrosive when selecting conduit type.
Mechanical Protection
Rigid conduit provides better protection against physical
damage than flexible types.
Flexibility Requirements
Use flexible conduit for connections to equipment that vibrates
or requires occasional movement.
Code Compliance
Always check the CE Code for specific requirements based on
the installation location and type of equipment.

Conduit Installation Best
Practices
Proper Support
Secure conduit at regular intervals as specified by the CE Code.
Appropriate Fittings
Use the correct connectors and fittings designed for the specific
type of conduit.
Proper Bending
When bending conduit, use appropriate tools to prevent kinking
or flattening.
Conductor Fill
Do not exceed the maximum number of conductors allowed
in a conduit based on its size.

Electrical Safety for Gas Technicians
Verify Power Off
Always confirm power is
disconnected before working on
electrical components
Use Proper Tools
Only use insulated tools designed for
electrical work
Follow Codes
Adhere to all CE Code requirements
for electrical installations
Personal Protection
Wear appropriate PPE when working
with electrical components

Jurisdictional Considerations
Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ)
Always check with the local electrical authority having jurisdiction for specific
requirements regarding electrical work.
Permit Requirements
Electricians are required to perform electrical work under a permit in all jurisdictions
in Canada.
Scope of Work
Gas technicians/fitters should understand what electrical work they are permitted
to perform in their jurisdiction.
Elementary Electrical Work
Gas and mechanical trades are permitted to perform elementary electrical work in
some Canadian jurisdictions.

Millivolt Systems
Many gas-fired appliances are considered self-contained or self-
powered. It is very common to encounter appliances equipped with
devices that generate electricity and that have components that operate
on direct current millivolt. This voltage is generated using heat from the
gas flame and is used to operate minor control and safety circuits and
extended systems, especially in offgrid applications.

Purpose of Millivolt Systems
Self-Contained Power
The gas technician/fitter must have
complete knowledge of how this voltage
is generated as well as the amount of
voltage that is generated. The gas
technician/fitter must also know how this
voltage is distributed through the circuit
and the test procedures used to isolate
problems when they arise.
Specialized Applications
The electrical principles remain the
same, but millivolt systems have very
specific applications and restrictions.
These systems are particularly valuable
in off-grid applications where external
power sources are unavailable.
Millivolt systems allow gas appliances to
operate independently without requiring
connection to household electrical
systems.

Generation of Small-Value DC
Voltages
Direct Current Basics
Unlike alternating current (AC),
direct current flows in one
direction only. Direct current (DC)
is used in many different
applications in North America.
Common DC Applications
It is normally used to power
electronic devices, control relays
on most building automation
systems, small appliances,
automotive electrical systems,
and, recently, solar panels.
DC Generation Methods
DC is often supplied by some form of battery or power supply converter.
However, other means, such as heating a bimetallic device called a
thermocouple, can generate small DC voltages.

Thermocouple Basics
Thermocouple Structure
A simple thermocouple consists of two wires, made of
dissimilar (different) metals joined together at one end. The
end at which they are joined is called the hot junction, while
the opposite end is the cold junction.
Some thermocouples consist of a wire located in the centre
of a small, circular metal tube. The tube and wire, which are
made of dissimilar (different) metals, are joined at one end
to form the hot junction (the opposite end is the cold
junction).
Figure 5-1 Combustion safety circuit thermocouple

How Thermocouples Generate Voltage
Heat Application
When sufficient heat is applied to the hot junction of a thermocouple
Voltage Generation
A small voltage is generated at the cold junction
Current Flow
Causing a positive-to-negative direct current flow
Measurement
The voltage generated is so small that it is measured in millivolts (mV)
If the cold junction is heated, current will flow in the opposite direction (negative-to-positive). A millivolt
is 1/1000 of a volt. Thermocouples generate voltages in the 0-30 mV range.

Thermocouple Applications
Safety Applications
Thermocouples are used as a flame
detection device or flame safeguard on
appliances that have constant pilots.
They are also used on appliances with
manual reset controls.
The thermocouple assembly is attached
with a threaded male fitting, as shown in
Figure 5-1.
Operation Principle
When the pilot burner heats the hot
junction, the thermocouple generates a
voltage to power the electromagnet coil
in the safety shut-off valve or safety
switch. As long as the pilot remains lit,
the spring-loaded solenoid shut-off
valve or safety switch will remain open to
allow the flow of gas to the main and pilot
burners.
Most thermocouples supply only a small
current in milliamps that is just enough to
energize a very small electromagnetic
solenoid.

Thermocouple Safety
Requirements
90-Second Shutdown
In order to meet the
requirements of CSA B149.1,
when a pilot fails (goes out), the
thermocouple must cool down
and de-energize the safety
shut-off valve or safety switch
within 90 seconds.
Input Limitations
For this reason, thermocouples
are only approved for use with
gas appliances with inputs up to
and including 400,000 British
thermal units per hour (Btu/h)
(117 kW).
Exception
A single thermocouple may be used to supervise inputs of natural gas
appliances with inputs of up to 1,000,000 Btu/h (300 kW) if they have
unrestricted vertical flue passes.

Propane Safety Requirements
20-Second Response Time
Appliances with a specific gravity greater than air (such as propane)
shall have a maximum flame response time of 20 seconds.
Fast Response Thermocouples
These appliances will be equipped with fast response thermocouples.
Common Applications
As many of these appliances, such as fireplaces, are convertible for
either fuel, this is the type of thermocouple that has become prevalent.

Hot Junction Requirements
Temperature Difference
The thermocouple only generates a
voltage if the temperature difference
between the hot and cold junctions is
at least 400°F (204°C).
The greater the temperature
difference, the greater the voltage
generated.
Proper Heating
For this reason, it is important that the
pilot flame heat only the first 0.375 to

## 0.5 inch (10 mm to 13 mm) of the hot

junction - no other part of the
thermocouple should be heated.
Correct positioning of the
thermocouple in the pilot flame is
critical for proper operation.

Cold Junction Connections
Connection Structure
One of the ends of the cold junction is
connected to the copper outer sleeve
of the thermocouple, creating one of
the conductors of the supply circuit.
Wiring Configuration
While the other lead from the cold
junction is connected to an insulated
wire enclosed in the copper sleeve,
which terminates at a coaxial
connection that is connected to the
safety switch or safety shut-off valve.
The cold junction connections
complete the electrical circuit for the
safety system.

Powerpile Generator
Definition
A powerpile, also known as a thermopile, consists of multiple
thermocouples joined together at one end and connected in
series to generate more voltage than a single thermocouple.
The total voltage generated by a thermopile is the sum of
the voltages generated by each thermocouple it contains.
Figure 5-3

Powerpile Characteristics
Multiple
Thermocouples
Most modern thermopiles
consist of 10 to 30
thermocouples connected
in series.
Higher Voltage
Output
Powerpile output ranges
from 250 to 750 mV, which
allows the powerpile to
power an appliance's
combustion safety circuit
and its control circuit.
Self-Sufficient Power
Powerpile generators are used on appliances with automatic-type
controls. Pilot/powerpile generators, as they are called, generate
electrical direct current power from the flame of a single pilot
source. This makes the appliance self-sufficient for stand-alone
applications.

Powerpile Types
Coaxial Powerpile
A coaxial powerpile looks like a thermocouple; however, its hot junction and contact end are
larger.
Two-Wire Powerpile
A two-wire powerpile has two cold junction leads that are covered with protective armour.
Some have the same connecting nut as a thermocouple.

Pilot Flame Characteristics
Normal Pilot Flame
•Is mostly blue in color
•Burns steadily
•Envelops 0.375 to 0.5 inch of the powerpile tip
Undesirable Flame Characteristics
CharacteristicCause
Hard, sharp flameToo small a pilot orifice
Noisy, lifting, blowing
flame
High gas pressure or
excess primary air
Small, blue flameSmall or restricted
orifice, low gas pressure,
or a clogged pilot filter

Environmental Considerations
Outdoor Exposure
Because of the frequent application of
self-contained/powered equipment,
appliances can be subject to more
outdoor environments, posing a greater
risk of exposure to spiders, rodents, or
generally dirty and contaminated areas.
Pool Heater Applications
A large number of residential pool
heaters incorporate a standing pilot and
thermopile system.
Service Considerations
Outdoor portable appliances are often
subject to service problems related to
plugged or restricted pilots due to the
surrounding conditions of the pilot
burner. Gas technicians/fitters need to
pay special attention to these
conditions.

Advantages of Millivolt
Control Circuits
Self-Generated
Power
The control voltage is
self-generated - no
external power source
is required. Some
applications such as
fireplace might have
120 V systems and
operate a fan motor.

can function even
during electrical utility

applications.

Isolating Millivolt Circuits
1
Physical Isolation
Millivolt circuits must be physically isolated from higher voltage circuits
2
Prevent Contact
Must not operate with or come in contact with 24V or 120V circuits
3
Avoid Damage
Higher voltage will short out and damage millivolt equipment
In order to install, accurately and safely operate, and test millivolt circuits, they must be physically isolated from 24 V and 120 V circuits.
Voltage from the conductors of the higher potential circuits will supply excessive voltage in the millivolt circuit, shorting out and
damaging the equipment. Millivoltage circuits must not be mixed with full voltage circuits.

Testing Millivolt Circuits
Required Equipment
Testing and troubleshooting circuits operating with a
millivoltage power supply requires the use of a
millivoltmeter.
Power SupplyProduces
Thermocouple30 mV
Thermopile (also known
as the powerpile)
up to 750 mV
Proper Positioning
To produce the correct voltage, position the thermocouple
or thermopile correctly in a pilot flame with the proper flame
characteristics, as shown in Figure 5-5.

Testing DC Power Supplies
Current Flow Direction
A thermocouple or thermopile
produces DC current flow (in one
direction). The direction of
current flow determines the
direction of needle movement.
Proper Connections
Be sure to connect the leads of
the test meter correctly as some
types of meters, especially
analogue meters, are sensitive to
polarity. Most digital meters will
just give you a negative reading.
Flash Test
To avoid damage, connect one
lead of the meter to the first test
point and then momentarily
touch the second lead to the
second test point. Called a flash
test, this test is performed to
verify that the direction of
needle movement is correct
before you connect the second
lead. If the needle moves
backward, the polarity is
reversed, so reverse the position
of the test leads.

Digital Multimeters for Millivolt Testing
Advantages of Digital
Multimeters
Most full functioning digital
multimeters:
•will read a millivolt circuit; and
•are the most common testing
device used with these systems.
Thermocouple Testing
A thermocouple:
•has an open circuit output of 30
mV; and
•can only be used to power a
pilotstat device in a combustion
safety circuit.
A thermocouple can be tested with:
•an open-circuit test; and
•a closed-circuit test.
Figure 5-6 Thermocouple combustion
safety system

Open-Circuit Test
Test Purpose
An open-circuit test shows the potential millivoltage that a
thermocouple can produce when it is not under load.
Equipment Requirements
To perform this test, use a high-resistance meter. Most digital
meters meet this requirement; however, only special analogue
meters are suitable for this application. Always ensure that the
proper meter is used for this test.
Test Preparation
Perform the open circuit test when the thermocouple is not
under load. Therefore, before starting the test, disconnect
the thermocouple from the pilotstat.

Open-Circuit Test Procedure
Select Meter Scale
Select a scale on the millivoltmeter suitable for reading a maximum 30 mV.
Connect Meter
Connect one lead of the meter to the outer copper conductor of the thermocouple and the
other lead to the end of the inner conductor (watch polarity of meter).
Heat Thermocouple
With a pilot flame heating the hot junction of the thermocouple, it should read
approximately 30 mV.
Evaluate Results
Replace the thermocouple if it produces less than 20 mV. Inspect the heated end for
excessive wear and burned casing.
If it appears questionable, the best action is to replace the thermocouple.

Closed-Circuit Test
Test Purpose
A closed-circuit test shows the millivoltage that can be maintained when the
thermocouple is powering a coil, usually the magnetic coil of a pilotstat device.
Perform the closed-circuit test when the thermocouple is connected to the coil in a
pilotstat device. In order to connect the meter in parallel with the load/coil, use a
thermocouple test adapter.
Test Benefits
This will test the performance of the thermocouple and show the millivoltage level
that can be maintained under load. At the same time, you can test the pilotstat coil to
determine its condition.

Closed-Circuit Test Procedure
Install Test Adapter
Disconnect the
thermocouple from the
pilotstat and install the test
adapter.
Reconnect and Light
Reconnect the
thermocouple to the top of
the test adapter and relight
the pilot burner.
Connect Test Leads
Connect one test lead to the
outer conductor of the
thermocouple and the other
test lead to the side terminal
on the test adaptor (watch
polarity).
Read Meter
The meter should read 15
mV if the thermocouple is in
good condition. Notice that
this is approximately one-
half of the open circuit
voltage.
The thermocouple can produce a potential of 30 mV when not under load but can only maintain 15 mV while under load. If the
closed-circuit voltage should drop to below 8 mV, replace the thermocouple.

Testing the Pilotstat Coil
Test Setup
It is easy to test the condition of the pilotstat coil with the
test adaptor in place. You need a small current to develop
the magnetic field required to hold the pilotstat valve open.
Because the current flow is so small, it is easier to measure
voltage.
Remember, there is a direct relationship between voltage
and current. With a pilotstat coil, as the voltage becomes
less, the magnetic field weakens. At some point, the
pilotstat drops out and shut off the flow of gas.
Test Procedure
1.Connect one lead of the millivoltmeter to the copper
conductor and the other to the terminal on the side of
the test adaptor (check polarity). Under normal
operation, the voltage reading is between 10 and 15 mV.
2.Blow out the pilot gas and allow the thermocouple to
cool. As it cools, watch the millivoltmeter and notice that
the reading is slowly decreasing.
3.The coil of the pilotstat should create enough magnetic
field to hold the valve open until the millivoltage drops
between 5 and 2 mV.

Interpreting Pilotstat Coil
Test Results
Weak Coil
If the coil drops out with more
than 5 mV, it is weak and
should be replaced.
Sticking Valve
If the coil holds the valve open
with less than 2 mV, the valve
is sticking and should be
replaced.
Safety Requirement
This drop out of the coil should take place within 90 seconds from
flame failure to meet the requirements of CSA B149.1.

Checking for Pilot Flame Failure
Common Service Problem
Loss of pilot flame is a common
service problem that you can check
with a millivoltmeter and test adaptor.
Comprehensive Testing
You should check the thermocouple,
pilotstat coil, and dropout time to
make sure all problems are identified,
then conduct an open circuit test as
discussed previously.
Proper testing helps identify the root
cause of pilot flame failures.

Thermopile Testing
Common Problems
Most of the problems in millivoltage circuits result from
increases in resistance that reduce the current flow to a
point where the gas valve coils do not operate.
The following are the causes of these resistances:
•loose wiring connections;
•corrosion to terminals and connectors;
•poor wire splices; and
•excessive wire lengths.
Testing Approach
The easiest way to identify where increases in resistance
have developed is to measure the millivoltage drop across
each component in the electrical circuit.
The key to successful troubleshooting and testing of
thermopiles is to know the normal millivoltage readings to
expect across each component of the circuit and to
recognize excessive readings. Excessive millivoltage drops
indicate excessive resistance.

Thermopile Output Types
250 mV Output
Used for simple control circuit consisting of a switch and a
gas valve
500 mV Output
Has enough electrical power to operate control circuits
with a gas valve, limit switch, and thermostat with long
wire leads (maximum 30 ft or 9 m)
750 mV Output
Is always used when it is necessary to power the control
circuit and the combustion safety circuit in parallel

Understanding Circuit Voltage
Open Circuit Voltage
The output voltages listed above are
approximate maximum voltages that
the devices produce during an open-
circuit test. Without a completed
circuit, the voltage is static and at its
maximum level, just as the pressure in
a water pipe is static and maximum
when there is no flow.
Closed Circuit Voltage
When a circuit is closed and current
begins to flow throughout the circuit,
a new voltage drop reading will occur
related only to the voltage loss across
the parallel circuit components.
The difference between open and
closed circuit voltage is critical for
understanding millivolt system
operation.

Source Resistance Series Circuit
Internal Resistance
All DC voltage sources have an
internal or source resistance that can
be observed but not directly
measured. To observe the source
resistance, a second resistance (load)
must be connected through a
completed circuit.
Voltage Drop Laws
To understand the change in readings
between the open and closed-circuit
tests and how they relate to the
source resistance, it is important to
remember the voltage drop laws. The
sum of all the voltage losses will be
equal to the voltage output.

Closed Circuit Voltage Example
Voltage Distribution
When the circuit is closed, the meter
reading at location #1 might show a
185 mV, which would be the voltage
drop across all the external
resistances. Therefore, the internal
resistance of the source, which cannot
be measured, would be 315 mV.
We can conclude that 315 mV is the
voltage drop caused by the internal
resistance at this particular amperage.

Effect of Component Resistance
Resistance Changes
Suppose that one of the components,
such as the thermostat, was to have a
higher resistance. This would increase
the resistance in the control circuit as
a whole, causing the current flow to be
reduced.
Impact on Readings
This reduced circuit amperage would
result in a lower voltage drop created
by the internal resistance of the
thermopile, and the closed-circuit
meter reading at location #1 would
increase.

Characteristics of 500 mV Thermopiles
Simple Control Circuit
Figure 5-13 displays a simple control
circuit consisting of a thermostat,
limit switch, gas valve, and a 500 mV
thermopile. Since there is no pilotstat
coil, a loss of flame does not cause
interruption to the pilot gas flow.
Voltage Distribution
The voltage of the source distributes
itself across the resistive components
that make up the load. The sum of all
the voltage drops throughout the
system must be equal to the output of
the source.
Figure 5-13 provides an explanation of
the maximum millivoltage readings
that should be expected on a 500 mV
circuit.
Figure 5-13 Typical voltage readings
on a simple millivoltage control

Testing 500 mV Circuits
Preparation
Turn off the gas and clean the thermopile and pilot burner before starting
the test.
Determine Valve Opening Voltage
Connect the test leads to position 2, light the pilot burner, and watch
the meter to determine the valve open (V.O.) reading. A typical
reading would be 60 mV.
Measure Maximum Output
Allow the thermopile to reach maximum output and record at
position 1. A typical output value would be 253 mV. This may take
approximately four minutes.
Check Valve Coil Power
Check the power across the valve coil (position 2). A typical
reading would be 140 mV.

Valve Operation Requirements
Safety Margin
For the valve to open consistently, some safety margin is
required above the power needed to open the valve. This
margin should be large enough to ensure a consistent
opening, but small enough to allow the longest service out of
the thermopile.
If 30 mV is considered a good safety margin, this example
provides 140 - 60 = 80 mV over what is required to open the
valve. Since some valves may require as much as 120 mV to
open, the voltage across the valve coil must be 150 mV or
more.
Valve Coil Issues
If the valve does not open by 150 mV, the valve coil is faulty
and must be replaced.
The readings across the coil can be affected by:
•Low output from the thermopile; and
•Satisfactory output from the thermopile but a high mV
drop in the rest of the system due to faulty splices,
excessive length of thermostat wire, or faulty thermostat
or limit switches.

Checking Wire and Component Losses
Check Total Wire Loss
This includes the wire and thermostat loss. A typical value would be 112 mV. This reading can be 50 mV or less with no heat
anticipator or 110 mV or less with a heat anticipator.
Check Thermostat Loss
A typical value would be 80 mV. These readings are 8 mV or less with no heat anticipator or 100 mV or less with a heat anticipator.
Determine Thermostat Wire Loss
Subtract the reading at position 4 from that at position 3. Position 3 - Position 4 = Thermostat wire loss. For example, 112 - 80 = 32
mV.
Check Limit Losses
This includes the limit and its wire. Usually the reading is close to zero (2 mV, for example).
If the wire loss is over 60 mV, check the visible line for poor splices which can cause over 100 mV losses.

Verifying Test Readings
Validation Formula
Ensure you have taken the correct readings:
Reading 2 + Reading 3 + Reading 5 = Reading 1
If there is a difference of more than 15 mV, recheck each
reading.

Diagnosis
The above readings indicate that the valve opens at 75 mV but only
increases to 77 mV at full output. This is too low.
The reading at 3 across the wiring and thermostat is 190 mV, which is
high.
Subtracting 30 mV from the 190 mV indicates a wire loss of 160 mV.
This must be a result of bad wiring contacts or a poor splice in the
wiring.
Solution
To correct this, clean the terminals and solder the splice.

Test Readings
Test locationPositionReading
V.O.280 mV
1260 mV

Diagnosis
The problem is that the reading at 2 is 5 mV below that required to open the
gas valve. Examination of the above readings shows that the limit switch
reading at 5 is very high, suggesting a faulty limit.
Solution
If this is corrected, there is sufficient voltage drop across the gas valve at 2.
Testing Tip
To obtain the V.O. reading when the power at 2 is too low, jumper the
thermostat terminals. This makes the 110 mV in the thermostat and wire
circuit available to help open the valve. Remove the jumper as soon as you
get the V.O. reading.
When you jumper the thermostat terminals, the 110 mV drop in the
thermostat and wire becomes zero, and the 110 mV becomes available to
the rest of the system; therefore, the valve opens. You could mistakenly
think the thermostat or wire is at fault.

Characteristics of 750 mV Thermopiles
Dual Circuit Applications
Use a 750 mV thermopile whenever there is a need to power
two circuits such as a control and combustion safety circuit.
Figure 5-14 shows both types of circuits. The safety circuit
consists only of a pilotstat coil, while the control circuit
consists of a thermostat, limit switch, and gas valve coil.
Figure 5-14 Testing millivoltage control systems with
combustion safety and control circuits

Source Resistance in a Parallel Circuit
Parallel Circuit Operation
When the power pile energizes a safety circuit, the latter is wired in
parallel to the control circuit so that it may be continuously
energized.
Although the open circuit potential of the thermopile may be 750
mV when it is connected to the equipment, there will always be a
closed pilotstat circuit, in which the internal resistance of the
thermopile is again part of the equation.
Voltage Distribution
The voltage drop across the pilotstat coil measures approximately
550 mV; therefore, the internal resistance is causing a loss of
approximately 200 mV. The internal resistance must be about 1/3
of the pilotstat resistance.

Parallel Circuit Effects
Resistance Changes
When the control circuit is closed and the main gas valve is energized,
a parallel circuit from the thermopile connections is created.
Since parallel connected circuits create a lower total resistance, the
total amperage in the overall circuit will increase. As the internal
resistance of the thermopile does not change, the increased
amperage will create an increase in the internal voltage drop.
Voltage Availability
Therefore, when the control circuit is made, the voltage drop across
the internal resistance increases, and the voltage available to the
control and safety circuits decreases.

750 mV System Voltage Readings
Open Circuit Output
The open circuit output of the
thermopile is 750 mV; however,
when it is connected to the
pilotstat, the millivoltage reading at
1 is reduced to approximately 550
mV.
Closed Circuit Output
When the thermostat contacts on
the control circuit close, the
millivoltage reading across 1 is
reduced to approximately:
•185 mV if the thermostat has no
heat anticipator; or
•240 mV if the thermostat has a
heat anticipator.
Consistent Values
These are the same values as found
on the control circuit of the 500 mV
systems. The test values 1 to 5 are
the same for both the 500 mV and
the 750 mV systems.

Testing 750 mV Circuits
Test the Pilotstat Coil
With the thermostat calling
for heat and the test meter
leads across the thermopile
terminals in position 1,
depress the manual reset
button on the pilotstat and
light the pilot.
Observe the Pilot
Flame
When the millivoltage
reading is at 170 mV, release
the manual reset button on
the pilotstat and observe the
pilot flame.
Evaluate Coil
Performance
If the valve does not hold in
and the pilot flame goes out,
replace the coil. If the
pilotstat holds in, blow out
the pilot and watch the test
meter. If the coil drops out
over 140 mV, replace the
coil.
Test Control Circuit
For testing of the control
circuit readings 1 to 5, refer
to the test procedures for
the 500 mV control systems.

Millivolt Thermostats
Purpose and Application
Millivoltage thermostats are used with
self-powered heating control
systems. The heat of the pilot flame
acting on the thermopile (pilot
generator) produces the control
system power. This type of
thermostat often has a label indicating
that it is only for use with millivolt
systems.
Voltage Considerations
As detailed, thermopiles produce 250,
500, or 750 mV. 750 mV is about one-
half the output of a 1.5 V D-size, dry-
cell battery.
The gas technician/fitter must always
ensure that the thermostat for a
particular installation is sized
according to the thermopile or power
generator used. The voltage rating for
a dedicated millivolt thermostat is
usually 0 to 1.5 V DC.
Millivolt thermostats are specifically
designed for low-voltage applications.

Thermostat Compatibility
Compatibility Issues
If a 24 V thermostat is used on a millivolt system, it
may have excessive resistance and cause too
great of a voltage loss. Alternately, if a dedicated
millivolt thermostat is used on a 24 V AC system,
the thermostat will be damaged.
Digital Thermostats
Most digital thermostats are rated for use on 24 V
AC or millivolt systems as the internal thermostat
functions run off the backup batteries when wired
for millivolt usage.
Power Requirements
The powerpile used must produce sufficient
power to:
•operate the gas valve; and
•overcome total system electrical resistance,
including the heat anticipator if one is
installed in the thermostat.

Proper Pilot Flame
A normal pilot flame is mostly blue in color, burns steadily, and envelops 0.375 to 0.5 inch of the powerpile tip.
Improper Pilot Flame
Undesirable flame characteristics include hard sharp flames (too small orifice), noisy lifting flames (high pressure/excess air), or small blue flames (restricted
orifice/low pressure).
Proper Positioning
The thermocouple or thermopile must be correctly positioned in the pilot flame for optimal voltage generation and system operation.

Basic Motor Construction
All electric motors have a similar basic structure with two main parts:
Stator (or frame)
The stator is stationary, consisting of two or more electromagnets and their
windings. It is usually cylindrical in shape, with field poles facing and projecting
their magnetic fields into the center space of the cylinder.
The windings are connected to a source of AC, which causes the poles to change
polarity in step with the changing direction of the AC.
Rotor
The rotor is mounted on a rotating shaft in the center of the stator. It has a
laminated iron core containing aluminum (sometimes copper) rods or bars along
its outer surface.
The rods or bars are almost parallel to the rotor shaft and serve as conductors
through which current flows. At the ends of the rotor are rings connecting the
rods or bars together, completing the current paths.
The bars and rings look like a squirrel cage, giving this type of motor its name.

How Motors Generate Motion
Magnetic Field Interaction
As the rotor turns, the bars swing across magnetic fields created by the
stator poles, inducing current in them.
Current Flow
The current in each rotor copper rod sets up a magnetic field that
interacts with the magnetic field created by the stator poles.
Rotation Force
Since "like" magnetic lines repel each other, and "unlike" fields attract
each other, the rotor starts to turn inside the stator.
Continuous Motion
The polarity changes when AC current is applied, constantly changing the
attraction and repulsion forces causing continuous rotation.

Motor Speed Calculation
The frequency of the current change determines the motor speed.
Typical AC power is supplied at 60 hertz (Hz or cycles per second), so the
rotor of a motor with two poles would turn 60 times every second, or
3600 revolutions per minute (RPM).
You can use the following formula to determine the synchronous speed
(without load) of motors in RPM:
RPM = (Frequency × 120) ÷ number of poles
This calculation gives theoretical motor speed. Internal motor friction
and connected mechanisms add resistance, affecting actual speed. The
difference between calculated and actual speed is called motor slip.
Excessive slip can indicate problems like improper lubrication, defective
bearings, tight belts, or an overloaded motor.

Three-Phase Motors Overview
Three-phase motors are efficient and economical. These motors are most
widely used throughout industry and are known for their constant speed
characteristics. They have various designs with a wide range of torque
characteristics.
Squirrel Cage Induction
The simplest construction of
AC motors with no physical
connections between rotor
and stator.
Wound Rotor
Features insulated winds with
slip rings and brushes,
providing very high starting
torque.
Synchronous
Runs at a speed exactly proportional to the line frequency, used where
constant speed is required.

Squirrel Cage Induction Motor
In a squirrel cage induction motor, no physical connections exist between the rotor and
the stator. Hence, the magnetic field must be induced into the rotor. Its construction is
the simplest of the AC motors.
Components
•A frame that provides a magnetic circuit and supports the stator windings
•Stator windings
•A squirrel cage rotor
•End bells
Characteristics
•Starting torque ranges from normal to very high depending on design
•Wide variations in applications due to torque range
•Efficient and economical operation
•Widely used in industry

Wound Rotor Motor
Design Differences
The difference between wound rotor motors and squirrel cage motors is in their rotor design. The wound
rotor has insulated winds with slip rings and brushes.
This design provides very high starting torque compared to standard squirrel cage motors.
Applications
Wound rotor motors are used widely throughout industry for:
•Cranes and hoists
•Elevators
•Machine tools
•Process pumps
These applications benefit from the high starting torque capabilities of wound rotor motors.

Synchronous Motor
Squirrel cage and wound rotors are asynchronous induction motors, meaning they always run at a speed which is less than the rotating magnetic field (synchronous speed). The synchronous motor operates differently.
Design
The rotor is essentially a DC electromagnet with the same number
of poles as the stator. The poles in most types project out from the
rotor.
The field poles are fed from a direct-current source, so their
polarity remains constant and lock into step with the rotating
magnetic field of the stator.
Starting
Synchronous motors usually require additional rotor windings such
as a squirrel cage to allow them to start as an induction motor.
Once up to speed, they lock into synchronous operation with the
line frequency.
Applications
Used where very constant speed is required, exactly proportional
to the line frequency.
Common in clocks, timing devices, and positioning motors.
Large synchronous motors with power ratings of several
megawatts are used in industrial processes for high efficiency.

Three-Phase AC Circuits
Delta Connection (Δ)
In the delta connection, the winding insulation is normally subjected to a higher voltage than that of the
wye connection.
The delta connection is usually not grounded so that a single ground on one phase will not affect the
operation of the motor.
Two or more grounds, however, constitute a short circuit between the points of the grounds and will
result in improper operation or failure of the motor.
Wye Connection (Y)
The wye connection is generally grounded at the common point.
While the winding insulation is usually subjected to a lower voltage (than the delta connection), a
ground on any of the phases will adversely affect the operation of the motor.
The direction of rotation of a three-phase motor can be reversed by switching any two motor leads.
Caution! After a three-phase induction motor has been disconnected for service, it is very important to reconnect the line conductors to the correct terminals. Failure to ensure this may result in the motor and
the load that it drives rotating in the wrong direction. This can cause damage.

Single-Phase Motors Overview
Single-phase motors operate on the same induction principle as three-phase motors once they get up to speed. A single-
phase motor, however, needs a supplementary device to make it self-starting.
Having no magnetic rotating field at start, it will have no starting torque as the magnetic fields are initially opposing each other.
The solution is to incorporate separate start windings, which will produce out-of-phase magnetic fields in the rotor.
Split-Phase Induction
Uses separate run and start
windings displaced by 90
electrical degrees.
Resistance-Start
A split-phase motor with an
external resistor in series with
the auxiliary winding.
Capacitor-Start
Uses a capacitor in series with
the starter winding for greater
torque.
Permanent-Split Capacitor
Uses its start winding and capacitor continuously
without change in capacitance.
Shaded Pole
Uses a shading coil or low resistance loop as its starter
winding.

Split-Phase Induction Motor
Essential Components
The split-phase induction motor has two separate and distinct windings on the stator that are mutually
displaced by 90 electrical degrees:
•The run winding
•The start winding
The direction of the current flow through the start windings determines the motor direction.
Operation
For starting purposes, both run and start windings are connected in parallel across the line. In series
with the start winding is a starting switch (usually a centrifugal switch).
These motors are fractional horsepower units and are found in small pumps. They can use either
wound or squirrel-cage rotors, although squirrel-cage is the most widely used.
In split-phase motors with four external line leads, the leads can be identified by tags, color, or by both
for clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation.

Resistance-Start Motor
Design
A resistance-start induction motor
is a split-phase motor in which an
external resistor is connected in
series with the auxiliary winding.
Operation
Because the start winding is highly
resistive and the run winding
highly inductive, the currents
through the two windings are
displaced by 30-50 electrical
degrees.
This creates a pulsating magnetic
field, which induces rotor currents
resulting in development of
torque.
Applications
Resistance-start motors have a low starting torque and are used for light
load applications where high starting torque is not required.

Capacitor-Start Motor
Also known as a capacitor-start induction run (CSIR) motor, the capacitor-start motor is similar in construction to a split-phase motor, except that it has a capacitor in series with the starter winding.
Capacitor Function
The capacitor permits a greater time displacement between the two winding currents (approximately 90°), resulting in a smoother rotating field and greater torque development in the rotor.
Starting Operation
Capacitor-start motors use the capacitor only while starting. It is disconnected once the motor reaches approximately three-quarter speed.
Centrifugal Switch
A centrifugal switch opens to bypass the capacitor in the circuit when the motor reaches sufficient speed.
Applications
These motors are used where high starting torque is required, such as conveyors, pumps, and reciprocating compressors.
Available in fractional horsepower or integral horsepower up to 15 HP.

Capacitor-Start Motor Construction
The capacitor-start induction run (CSIR) motor combines the benefits of split-phase motors with improved starting torque thanks to the capacitor in the start circuit.
Key Components
•Run winding (main winding)
•Start winding with capacitor in series
•Centrifugal switch
•Squirrel cage rotor
Operation Sequence
1.When power is applied, both run and start windings are energized
2.The capacitor creates phase displacement between windings
3.This produces a rotating magnetic field with high starting torque
4.As motor reaches about 75% of rated speed, the centrifugal switch opens
5.This disconnects the start winding and capacitor
6.Motor continues running on the main winding only

Permanent-Split Capacitor Motor
Design Features
The permanent-split capacitor (PSC) motor is a capacitor motor that uses its start winding and
capacitor continuously without change in capacitance.
The arrangement of windings and connections is exactly the same as the capacitor-start motor,
except that the starting switch is omitted.
This design eliminates the need for a starting switch or relay, simplifying the motor construction.
Applications and Characteristics
PSC motors are generally not suitable for belted applications or for any continuous-duty
application requiring substantial locked-rotor torque.
These motors are ideal for light duty fans and direct drive applications.
The PSC motor starts up very slowly compared to split-phase motors, which is desirable for forced
air fans as it reduces start-up noise.
In the connection diagram, the line leads are identified for clockwise rotation and counter-
clockwise rotation.

Shaded-Pole Induction Motor
Definition
A shaded-pole motor may be defined as
a single-phase induction motor that
uses a shading coil or low resistance
copper/aluminum loop as its starter
winding.
Construction
This shaded coil is mounted on one side
of each of the stator poles. This setup
produces a moving magnetic field
perpendicular to the field pole and starts
the rotor turning.
Applications
These economical, reliable motors are
used in a wide variety of very low torque
applications such as small fans and
humidifiers.
They are simple in construction with no
starting switch, making them reliable
but limited in torque capabilities.

Single-Phase Motor Protection
Single-phase motors draw a very heavy current upon start-up, but this current rapidly drops off once the motor begins to run.
Overload devices ensure that the motor, if subjected to excessive torque during start-up or run time, does not overheat.
Temperature-Sensing
Devices
Motor thermostats directly
sense the motor winding
temperature to prevent
overheating.
Current-Sensing Devices
Measure current as an indication
of motor temperature, shutting
down the motor if excessive
current is detected.
External Protection
Starters with calibrated overload
devices that trip and disengage
the circuit under excessive
conditions.
Overheating is the primary factor for deterioration of insulation and motor failure. Protection devices are typically set by the
motor manufacturer based on motor type, application, load requirements, operating temperature, and location.

Start-Up Devices for Single-
Phase Motors
Single-phase motors (1/20 hp to 5 hp) need additional current to start up. Various
devices help provide this initial inrush of current.
Built-in Devices
•Centrifugal switch
•Capacitor
External Devices (for hermetic motors)
•Current relay
•Potential relay
•Solid-state relay
Selection criteria for these devices include motor type, application requirements, load
requirements, amperage draw, operating temperature, and installation location.

Centrifugal Switch
Initial Position
The split-phase motor contains
a centrifugal switch with
flyweights mounted on the rotor
shaft.
Acceleration Phase
As the motor accelerates,
centrifugal force moves the
flyweights outward against the
force of the spring.
Switch Opening
As the flyweights move out,
they force a collar to move along
the rotor shaft and push the
switch open. This occurs when
the motor reaches about 75% of
its rated speed.
Deceleration Phase
As the motor slows down, the
centrifugal force on the
flyweights decreases and the
spring forces them back in
towards the rotor shaft. This
permits the switch to close
again.

Capacitors in Motor Circuits
Start Winding Capacitors
If used in the start winding only, it is called a capacitor-start motor. Being used for a few
seconds at a time, it should have no cooling problems.
However, if a motor is started too often or if the start winding is used for a longer period than
it is designed for, the capacitor insulation will overheat, and the capacitor may fail.
Note: Never use a starting capacitor in the run circuit.
Run Winding Capacitors
If the capacitor is used for the run winding, it is carefully designed to dissipate any heat
generated during operation.
Run capacitors are designed for continuous duty and have different electrical characteristics
than start capacitors.
Caution! Never place fingers across the terminals of a capacitor. It may be charged and
may give a shock. Always short out the terminals with a rated resistor before handling it.

Capacitor Testing and
Replacement
Substitution Test
When a motor does not start or run properly, there is a good possibility that the
trouble is in the capacitor. The simplest capacitor test is to substitute a good
capacitor (of the same specifications) for the one being tested.
Verification
If the motor operates with the new capacitor, the old one is faulty. The replacement
capacitor should be of the same voltage and capacity as the old capacitor.
Replacement Guidelines
If you must use a different capacitor, it should be 5% to 10% over capacity rather than
under.
Common Failures
The most common cause for failure of a capacitor is a ground or open circuit
condition. Most multimeters will check for these conditions.

External Start-Up Devices
External start-up devices are needed when it is not possible to include
switches inside the motor, as in the case of a hermetic motor.
Starting Relays
Starting relays are used to remove the starting winding from operation
when the motor reaches approximately 75% of its normal running speed.
Types of Starting Relays
•Current relay (amperage relay)
•Potential relay (voltage relay)
•Solid-state relay
Each type of relay operates on different principles but serves the same
purpose: to disconnect the start winding once the motor is up to speed.

Current Relay Operation
The current relay is sometimes called amperage relay since it is the amperage draw on the circuit that operates the relay. This electromagnetic relay is normally used on small
capacitor-start induction-run motors.
Initial Connection
The relay coil is connected in series with
the motor's run winding.
Starting Position
The magnetic relay is an electromagnet
much like a solenoid. Either a weight or a
spring holds the starting winding contact
points open when the system is idle.
Start-Up Sequence
When the motor control contacts close
and high current flows into the running
winding, the magnetic current relay coil
is heavily magnetized. It lifts the weight
or overcomes the spring pressure and
closes the contacts.
Running Operation
This action closes the starting winding
circuit, and the motor quickly
accelerates. As it reaches 2/3 or 3/4 of
rated speed, the amperage draw
decreases, reducing the magnetic
strength enough to be overcome by the
weight or spring, opening the contacts.

Potential Relay
Definition and Use
Potential relay, sometimes called voltage relay, is usually used with larger sizes of
capacitor-start induction-run motors.
Like the current relay, the potential relay has a magnetic coil that, when energized,
operates a set of movable contacts.
Operation
The contacts in this relay are held closed by gravity or a spring and are open only when
the coil is energized.
This normally closed feature is its biggest advantage since there is no arcing of the relay
points when the circuit closes.
The relay responds to the back EMF (electromotive force) generated by the motor as it
accelerates, opening the start circuit at the appropriate time.

Solid-State Relay
Components
Relays using solid-state
transistors, diodes, and triacs
are used to control starting of
hermetic motors.
Operation
Changes in voltage in the
motor as it starts and gathers
speed are used to open the
start winding circuit at the
correct time.
Advantages
These relays are not as sensitive to the size of the motor as other
relays. The same solid-state relay can be used for motors varying
from 1/12 to 1/3 hp.
They have no moving parts, making them more reliable and longer-
lasting than mechanical relays.

Overload Protection Devices
If a motor is overloaded, it heats up. This temperature rise is destructive to the motor and, if left unchecked, will burn out the motor.
Motor overload protection devices are designed to sense the increase in motor current to temperature relationship and to shut it
down if a damaging increase in temperature is detected.
Temperature-Sensing Device
Temperature-sensing devices (called motor thermostats)
directly sense the motor winding temperature.
These devices do not carry current as they would heat up and
give a false reading if they did.
Usually, these devices are automatic since they are located
inside the housing and are inaccessible.
Reset time may take anywhere from 20 minutes to several
hours, depending on motor size and how many trips have
occurred.
Current-Sensing Device
One type is the temperature disc (Klixon disc). Current flows
through the bi-metal disc and heats it.
A predetermined amount of current heats the disc enough to
cause it to warp so that it opens a set of contacts.
After the contacts open to break the circuit, the disc cools
down and automatically resets.
This type of current overload device, referred to as replica
protection, is usually mounted inside the housing of small
motors.

External Overload Protection
Magnetic Starter
Most external overload protection is
provided by a starter with overload
devices calibrated to the motor
conditions of operation.
Operation Types
The starter can be manual or
automatic and will have
temperature-sensitive current
devices that protect the motor
within its full load current capacity.
Protection Mechanism
The thermal overload will trip the starter and disengage the circuit to the motor
under excessive conditions, preventing damage from overheating.
External overload devices are more accessible for maintenance and replacement
compared to internal protection devices. They can be adjusted or replaced without
disassembling the motor.

Motor Insulation
Basic Functions
Motor insulation has two basic functions:
•To separate the various electrical components from one
another and from the stator iron and all the structural parts
•To protect itself and the electrical components from
contaminants and other destructive forces
Materials and Design
Coil windings are usually insulated with varnish-impregnated
paper, fiberglass, or polymers.
The insulation is designed not only to withstand the normal
voltages to which they are exposed, but also to include a
margin to handle voltage surges.
The insulation of the leads from such coils is usually
deliberately made weaker so that, should failure occur, it may
be more apt to take place outside the stator or rotor where it
would be more easily repaired.
Motor heating is the primary cause of motor insulation failure. Heat causes deterioration of the insulation, resulting in a
breakdown in insulating quality, short circuits, and eventually motor failure.

Insulation Temperature Rating
The standard ambient temperature used for insulation rating purposes is 40°C (104°F), meaning the motor will begin to overheat when the air or other contacting medium is higher than 40°C.
Different insulation classes are designed to withstand different maximum operating temperatures. The higher the class, the higher the temperature the insulation can withstand before breaking down. Most modern motors
use Class B or higher insulation.

Motor Bearings
Bearings are one of the most vital parts of the motor and, except for the starting switch, are the only wearing parts in most types of fractional
horsepower electric motors. Three-phase motors have even fewer moving parts. With only two bearings, they are easily maintained.
Sleeve Bushings
Require periodic lubrication through
grease fittings.
Used in smaller, lighter-duty
applications.
Ball Bearings
Most designs are sealed and self-
lubricating.
Provide better support for heavier loads
and higher speeds.
Roller Bearings
Used in larger motors and heavy-duty
applications.
Can handle greater radial loads than ball
bearings.
When motors are repaired and/or serviced, the bearings may be replaced with sealed-for-life bearings and, as such, should have the grease
fittings removed and holes plugged.

Motor Speed Control
Speed control is often desirable in a large number of fan and blower
applications in heating and air-conditioning installations.
Direct Drive Motors
The PSC direct drive fan
motor is directly linked to
the fan wheel.
Multi-Speed Motors
A multi-speed PSC motor
can be identified by a
number of wires at the
motor electrical
connections.
Speed Selection
For single speed operations, only one of the speed taps is wired to
the hot leg of the power supply. The other unused hot wire leads
are capped and taped separately.

Multi-Speed Motor Wiring
Wiring Configuration
The wiring schematic on the fan indicates the speed color codes. Note the brown wires for the external run
capacitor and the orange and purple wires that can be switched to change the fan direction of rotation (CCW or
CW).
When more resistance is wired into the circuit, the motor speed decreases. As the resistance of the motor winding
decreases, the speed of the motor increases.
Operation
The motor remains in the off position until there is a call to circulate the heated air throughout the heating system.
The fan motor then circulates the heated air at the determined speed (high, medium, low).
Several speeds can be obtained, depending upon which speed tap is wired. It's important to note that multispeed
motors cannot have two speeds energized at the same time as they do not have internal switching.

Two-Speed Fan Operation
Older Furnace Systems
For older furnaces, when more than one speed was required, a multiple speed motor needed
to be connected to a relay so that two speed taps could be used.
Some systems were designed so that the fan motor operated at a low speed on the off cycle
to provide building air circulation. It then operated at high speed when the fan switch closed
to provide heated air circulation.
Relay Operation
A single-pole, double-throw relay can open one circuit and close another circuit at the same
time.
A relay connected to the Lo speed tap and to the Med-hi on a four-speed motor will operate
at low speed until the fan switch energizes the relay. Once energized, the relay switch powers
the medium-high circuit, and the fan speed increases.

Modern Furnace Control Boards
Modern furnaces use an electronic circuit board with multiple fan speed terminals to
switch fan speeds. The circuit board energizes the appropriate terminal to match the
operating parameters of the furnace such as low heat, high heat, or cooling.
Speed Wire Connection
The appropriate motor speed
wire is connected to the
appropriate terminal, and any
speed wires not required are
connected to the terminals
marked "unused" or "parked"
wire.
Speed Configuration
The manufacturer gives
recommended blower speed for
the various stages, but this
always needs to be field verified
for each particular installation.
Performance Specifications
The manufacturer also specifies the temperature rise and the maximum
external static pressure for the furnace.

Variable Speed DC Motors
Where a load is driven by a motor and its speed needs to be varied, a DC motor may be used. A DC motor includes two main
circuits:
Field Circuit
The stationary component that creates the magnetic field.
Armature Circuit
Rotates with the drive shaft and interacts with the field
circuit.
In general, DC motors have the characteristic of delivering a momentary high torque under load conditions at speeds above
zero to full speed. This characteristic is ideal for acceleration and deceleration applications. These motors are also more energy
efficient than AC motors.
Series Motor
High starting torque but poor
speed regulation.
Shunt Motor
Fairly high torque and constant
speed regulation under any load.
Compound Motor
Combines features of both series
and shunt motors for high torque
and good speed control.

DC Series Motor
Speed Control
The speed of a DC series motor is
controlled by varying the source
voltage that is applied in series
with the field and armature
circuits.
Characteristics
Although its starting torque is
high, its speed regulation is poor.
The speed varies significantly
with changes in load - as load
decreases, speed increases
dramatically.
Applications
Used in applications requiring high starting torque and where variable
speed is acceptable or desirable.
Common in traction applications like electric vehicles, cranes, and hoists.

DC Shunt Motor
Applications
Where a fairly high torque is required and constant speed regulation under any load is
desired, a DC shunt motor is used.
These motors maintain relatively constant speed regardless of load changes, making
them ideal for applications requiring precise speed control.
Speed Control Methods
To control the speed of this kind of motor, either:
•The voltage to the field circuit is varied (field control)
•The voltage to the armature is varied (armature control)
Each method provides different speed control characteristics and is selected based on
the specific application requirements.

DC Compound Motor
Design
In applications where it is desirable
to have both a high torque and
good speed control
characteristics, a DC compound
motor is used.
Operation
Combines the characteristics of
both series and shunt motors by
having both series and shunt field
windings.
The series field provides high
starting torque while the shunt
field provides good speed
regulation.
Speed Control
Two methods of variable speed control are available, similar to those used in
shunt motors.
The compound configuration allows for more flexible control options to
match specific application requirements.

Solid-State Devices in Speed Control
Historical Development
Prior to the discovery of solid-state devices, it was common to control the speed of DC
motors by using rheostats to adjust the DC voltage source.
Since solid-state devices are much smaller in size and are more energy-efficient - they
do not dissipate heat like rheostats - these devices are now used as speed control
devices.
Modern Control Systems
A typical variable speed control uses silicon-controlled rectifiers (SCRs) and other solid-
state components.
With solid-state devices, there is no longer a need for a DC source because these devices
also convert AC to DC. The net result is that a DC motor can be energized from an AC
source.
This provides more efficient, precise, and reliable speed control than older mechanical
methods.

Electronically Commutated Motor (ECM)
The ECM is a brushless DC, three-phase motor with a permanent magnet rotor. Motor phases are sequentially energized by the electronic
control, powered from a single-phase supply.
Construction
The GE ECM variable speed motor is
built as two separate components: the
motor, which does not have any
windings in it, and the controls section.
Control System
The controls section includes a
microprocessor calibrated at the factory
to suit the piece of equipment and
enable the motor to adapt its speed to
match the system conditions.
Applications
The ECM is widely used in most new
furnaces and air handlers as it can
supply the correct programmed air flow
(CFM) by monitoring the relationship
between speed, torque, and airflow.

ECM Motor Components
Motor Module
The motor component contains the permanent magnet rotor and stator assembly.
Unlike traditional motors, it doesn't have conventional windings but relies on the
control module to energize the appropriate phases.
The design eliminates brushes, making it more reliable and efficient than traditional
DC motors.
Control Module
Houses the microprocessor and power electronics that control the motor operation.
Programmed at the factory to match the specific equipment requirements.
Provides precise control of speed, torque, and airflow based on system demands.
Connects to the main control board via a multi-pin harness to receive operating
commands.

ECM Operation Principles
The motor control module receives communication from the control board indicating the desired CFM to match the operating state such as heating stages, cooling and circulating. This connection is made with a 16-pin harness.
Cruise Control Analogy
The ECM works like cruise control on a car, except the ECM is trying to maintain a set CFM instead of KPH.
Adaptive Operation
If the filter gets dirty, this will cause an increase in the static pressure. As the static pressure goes up, the motor senses a change in the torque and starts to increase the RPM to maintain the CFM.
Environmental Adaptation
The same adjustment would occur for different humidity levels of the air, ensuring consistent airflow regardless of conditions.
Efficiency Advantage
An ECM maintains an efficiency range between 60% and 80% among all speeds versus a PSC motor with multiple windings getting between 10% efficiency at lower speed to 50% efficiency at higher speeds.

Motion Control Positioning Motors
There are many examples of valves and dampers that are automatically operated by motors. Some applications may only require a fully
open or closed position, whereas others require a full range of positions (modulation).
Common Names
•Actuating motors
•Motor operators
•Modulating motors
•Electronic actuators
Positioning Methods
•Powered fully open or closed
•Floating action
•Servo motors
•Stepper motors

Fully Open or Fully Closed Motor Operators
Basic Operation
A basic open or closed motorized system is often used on dampers and hydronic control
valves.
They receive a 24V AC or 110V AC signal, which energizes the synchronous motor
opening or closing the valve.
Mechanism
When power is applied, the motor and gears act against the force of a spring to operate
the valve.
When power is removed, the spring returns the valve to its resting position.
These types of valve consume power whenever they are active and, typically, when the
system controls are calling for heat.
The motor runs until the valve is fully open or closed and then stalls as the actuator
mechanism cannot move any further - valve position feedback may be used with some
controllers.

Modulating Motor Actuators
You can use a modulating actuator to position the control valve in response to the system requirements.
Floating Action
Floating action valve motor actuators receive a powered
voltage control signal (24V AC, 110V AC, or 230V AC) in
order to move a valve.
The floating action controller either provides power to
drive the motor further open or closed.
If no power is supplied, the actuating motor remains at its
present position.
Positioning Method
This is a simple and cost-effective method for controlling
the position of a mixing valve.
It uses the timing of the actuator to position the valve. For
example, if it needs to be at 20% open and the actuator is
a 90 second model, from full closed, it will send an open
command for 18 seconds.

Floating Action Positioning Motor
Control Signals
Floating action motors typically operate on 24V AC control signals.
The controller sends signals to either open or close the valve/damper incrementally.
When no signal is present, the actuator holds its position.
Applications
Commonly used in HVAC systems for:
•Zone control dampers
•Mixing valves for hydronic systems
•Variable air volume (VAV) box dampers
•Other applications requiring proportional control
Provides a cost-effective solution for modulating control without the complexity of servo systems.

Stepper Motors
A stepper motor operator is an open loop positioning system that converts digital pulses into mechanical shaft rotation. It is a brushless DC electric motor that moves in increments or
steps, rather than turning smoothly as a conventional motor does.
Construction
In a stepper motor, there is an internal rotor made of a magnetic wheel with a large
number of projected (salient) poles and controlled by a set of external magnets switched
electronically.
The number of poles and magnets determines the size of the incremental rotation in
degrees and can vary depending on the application; it can be from 90° to 0.75°,
corresponding to 4 to 500 steps per revolution.
Operation
Inside the device, sets of coils produce magnetic fields that interact with the fields of
permanent magnets.
The coils are switched on and off in a specific sequence (steps) by a microcontroller to
cause the motor shaft to turn one step or pole at a time.
By sending out a control number of steps, the motor can be turned to the desired angle.
The motor can also operate in either direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) and hold
at a certain position until different coils are energized.

Stepper Motor Applications
Gas Valve Control
The image shows a gas valve that
utilizes a stepper motor to modulate
the servo regulator on the valve.
This enables it to fully modulate the
manifold pressure and therefore the
firing rate of the appliance.
Precision Control
Stepper motors provide precise
positioning capability, allowing for
exact control of gas flow.
The digital control signals can
position the valve at any point in its
range with high repeatability.
Other HVAC Applications
Beyond gas valves, stepper motors are used in various HVAC applications requiring
precise positioning:
•Electronic expansion valves in refrigeration systems
•Precision damper controls
•Zone control systems

Servo Motors
A servo motor operator is a part of a closed loop system. Along with the motor, a positioning circuit is included in the modulating actuator, which accepts an analogue
control signal (typically 0-10V or 4-20mA).
Control Signal Input
The actuator interprets the control signal as the valve position between the limit switches.
Position Feedback
The actuator has a position sensor (usually a potentiometer), which feeds the actual valve position back to the positioning circuit.
Signal Comparison
The controller compares the desired position (input signal) with the actual position (feedback signal).
Position Adjustment
The actuator can be positioned along its stroke in proportion to the control signal, with continuous adjustment to maintain the exact position.
The servo motor systems are used where a high degree of accuracy and acceleration are required.

Servo Motor Applications
Precision Control Systems
Servo motors are used in applications requiring:
•High positioning accuracy
•Fast response times
•Ability to handle varying loads
•Continuous position feedback
HVAC Applications
In HVAC systems, servo motors are commonly used for:
•Precision mixing valves in hydronic systems
•Variable air volume (VAV) box damper control
•Economizer dampers requiring precise positioning
•Critical process control applications where exact positioning is essential
The closed-loop feedback system ensures that the actual position matches the commanded position, even under varying load
conditions.

Motor Selection Considerations
Application Requirements
Different motors are needed for different tasks because motors have different starting
and running characteristics.
Torque Needs
Compressors require a motor with a high starting torque and good running efficiency.
Small propeller fans use motors with a low starting torque and average running
efficiency.
Power Supply
Motors are classified according to the type of AC power (three-phase or single-phase)
and the motor's principle of operation.
Environmental Factors
Consider ambient temperature, humidity, and exposure to contaminants when
selecting a motor.
Always consult the manufacturer's manuals and instructions before choosing or installing a
motor to ensure proper selection for the specific application.

Motor Maintenance Best Practices
Regular Inspection
Periodically check motors for unusual noise, vibration, or heat which can indicate developing
problems.
Inspect mounting bolts and connections to ensure they remain tight.
Bearing Maintenance
Follow manufacturer's recommendations for lubrication intervals and procedures.
For motors with grease fittings, avoid over-greasing which can damage seals and cause overheating.
Electrical Checks
Periodically measure current draw to ensure it remains within nameplate specifications.
Check insulation resistance to detect deterioration before failure occurs.
Cleanliness
Keep motors clean and free from dust, dirt, and oil which can impede cooling and cause insulation
breakdown.
Ensure ventilation openings remain unobstructed for proper cooling.
