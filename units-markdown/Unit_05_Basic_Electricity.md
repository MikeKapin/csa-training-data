before use.
Safety Footwear
Electrical hazard (EH) rated footwear provides secondary protection against incidental contact with electrical circuits of 600 volts or less under dry conditions.
Face and Eye Protection
Arc-rated face shields and safety glasses protect against arc flash and flying particles during electrical work.

Testing Equipment for Electrical Safety
Always use properly rated test equipment to verify that electrical circuits are de-energized before beginning work. Test equipment should be
inspected before each use and calibrated regularly according to manufacturer specifications.

Lock-out/Tag-out Equipment
A comprehensive lock-out/tag-out program requires proper equipment to secure energy sources. Each worker should have their own personal locks
and tags to ensure accountability and safety during maintenance procedures.

Static Electricity Control
Hazards of Static Electricity
Static electricity poses a significant risk in environments
where flammable gases are present. The main danger is
arcing, which can ignite flammable materials or gases.
A static charge can build up on objects through friction,
particularly in dry environments or when materials are
separated. This accumulated charge can discharge
suddenly, creating a spark that may ignite flammable
substances.
Control Measures
•Use proper grounding techniques for all equipment
•Install ground straps where necessary
•Use anti-static mats in work areas
•Maintain proper humidity levels when possible
•Wear anti-static footwear and clothing
•Use bonding wires to connect containers during liquid
transfers

Chapter 2
Basic Electrical Theory and
Concepts

Purpose and Objectives
Purpose
The gas technician/fitter requires a basic knowledge of
electrical theory in order to understand the operation of
electrical components and circuits.
Objectives
At the end of this Chapter, you will be able to:
•describe atoms, electrons, and electricity;
•describe electrostatic charges and fields; and
•describe the production and use of electricity.

Key Terminology
Atom
Smallest particle of matter that can take part in a
chemical reaction
Conductor
Material through which electric current can pass
Electric current
Transfer of electrical energy from moving electrons
Electromagnetism
Phenomenon when any conductor of electric current
acts like a magnet
Insulator
A substance or device that does not readily conduct
electricity
Ion
An atom or molecule with a net electric charge due to the
loss or gain of one or more electrons

Atoms and Molecules
Matter
Everything that has mass or
occupies space is what you
call matter.
Atoms
The smallest particle of
matter that can take part in
a chemical reaction is an
atom. Atoms are the
submicroscopic building
blocks of matter.
Molecules
Atoms combine to form larger particles called molecules. Atoms
and molecules are much too small to be seen or weighed directly.

Elements and Compounds
Elements
An element is a substance made up of only one kind of atom.
Compounds
A compound contains more than one type of atom, chemically combined.
Water is an example of a compound. Each water molecule is made up of one oxygen atom and two
hydrogen atoms.

Atomic Structure
23
Nucleus
The centre of the atom is the nucleus (plural nuclei), which houses
protons and neutrons.
Protons
Positively charged particles in the nucleus.
Neutrons
Neutral particles in the nucleus with about the same mass as
protons.
Electrons
Negatively charged particles that revolve around the nucleus in
orbits.

Carbon Atom Structure
The diagram shows a carbon atom with 6 protons in its nucleus and 6 electrons revolving around it in orbits. The number of electrons,
protons, and neutrons in the atoms of an element determines how that element behaves.
Atoms of different elements have different numbers of protons in their nuclei. This number is the atomic number that identifies that
element. For example, the nucleus of a carbon atom always contains 6 protons, and you say that the atomic number of carbon is 6.

Electron and Proton Relationship
The electron carries the basic Unit of electrical charge. For historical reasons, an electron's charge is considered to be a negative(-) charge. Because it is free to move, an
electron actively participates in the transfer of electrical energy.
The proton carries a positive(+) charge, opposite to that of an electron. It has the same size of charge as the electron's negative one. Protons are not directly active in the flow of
electrical energy, but they do influence the flow of electrons.
Negative electrons revolve in orbits around the positively charged
nucleus
The nucleus of an atom has an overall positive electrical charge due to the protons. The
negatively charged electrons revolve around the positive nucleus.
Attraction Between Charges
The opposite charges of electrons and protons create an attraction that keeps
electrons orbiting around the nucleus.

Atoms and Ions
Neutral Atom
Equal numbers of protons and
electrons
Positive Ion
Atom loses one or more electrons
Negative Ion
Atom gains one or more electrons
Under normal circumstances, the atom has equal numbers of protons and electrons. These charges cancel each other out, and
the atom as a whole is electrically neutral.
An atom can receive a negative charge through the addition of electrons. It can receive a positive charge through removal of
electrons. When charging an atom occurs these ways, the atom becomes ionized and is now an ion. For example, a positive ion
is an atom that has had one or more electrons removed.
Since protons are firmly bound into the nucleus, only electrons can take part in ionizing the atom.

Conductors and Insulators
Conductors
Some materials, including copper and aluminum, have electrons that are easy to free. They are
said to have many free electrons and are conductors. Conductors allow easy transfer of electrical
energy.
Insulators
Some other materials, such as glass and rubber, have electrons that are very difficult to free. They
are said to have few free electrons and are insulators. Insulators block the transfer of electrical
energy.

Electrostatic Charges and Fields
Electrostatic charges and fields are also known as static electricity. Static electricity is energy in the form of a stationary electric charge such as that stored in
thunderclouds or produced by friction.
For example, when you rub together certain pairs of materials (such as fur and a rubber rod), an electrostatic charge is produced. The friction produces heat
energy that releases electrons from the atoms on the surface of one of the materials.
Static Electricity in Nature
Thunderclouds store static electricity that can be released as lightning.
Friction-Generated Static
Rubbing materials together can generate static electricity through the transfer
of electrons.

Electrical Charges
Electron/Proton BalanceResulting Charge
Fewer electrons than protonsHas a positive charge
More electrons than protonsHas a negative charge
The same number of electrons and protonsIs neutral
An object may possess a positive electrical charge, a negative electrical charge, or it may be electrically neutral. The type of charge that
an object has depends on the number of electrons and protons it has.

Law of Electrical Charges
The Fundamental Law
Like charges repel and unlike charges attract.
Negative and Negative
Negatively charged particles repel other negatively charged particles. They tend
to move away from each other.
Positive and Positive
Positively charged particles repel each other. They tend to move away from each
other.
Positive and Negative
Negatively charged particles attract positively charged particles. They tend to
move toward each other.

Electrostatic Forces and Fields
The electrical charges on protons and electrons are electrostatic charges. An electrostatic charge has an electrostatic field associated with it and,
within this field, electrostatic forces occur. These forces are the forces of attraction and repulsion between charged particles.
Lines of Force Around a Negative Charge
Electrical diagrams show the lines of force around a negative charge as
straight lines with arrows pointing toward the charge.
Lines of Force Around a Positive Charge
Diagrams show the lines of force around a positive charge as radiating
outward from the charge.

Forces of Attraction and Repulsion
Figure 2-4 shows how the lines of force around positively and negatively charged objects cause forces of attraction and repulsion.
The strength of the forces of attraction and repulsion depends on:
•the amount of charge on each object; and
•the square of the distance between the objects.
The greater the electric charges on the objects, the greater the electrostatic force.
Also, the closer the charged objects are to each other, the greater the electrostatic force.

Production of Electricity
Heat - Thermoelectricity
The application of heat to two
different metals joined together
leads to the transfer of electrons
across the junction.
Magnetism -
Electromagnetism
When a conductor passes a
magnetic field, the forces of the
magnetic field act on the
electrons in the conductor.
Chemicals -
Electrochemistry
Chemical action results in the
transfer of electrons from one
electrode to another through an
electrolyte.
Pressure - Piezoelectricity
Force from the application of pressure to certain
crystal materials drives the free electrons out of orbit.
Light - Photoelectricity
When light strikes certain materials, the energy from
the light causes the atoms to release electrons.

Thermoelectricity
Heat Application
Heat is applied to two different metals joined together
Electron Transfer
Electrons transfer across the junction
Charge Creation
One side becomes positive with respect to the other
Practical Application
Thermocouples function as thermometers to detect and measure temperature
Thermocouples often function as thermometers to detect and measure temperature. The current that a thermocouple produces is enough to hold in a small electromagnet within a
gas valve, indicating the presence or absence of a pilot flame.

Electromagnetism
Magnetic force fields surround magnets, which have magnetic poles that attract or repel each other. When a conductor passes a magnetic field, the forces of the
magnetic field act on the electrons in the conductor, causing them to move through the conductor.
The same thing happens if you hold steady the conductor in a moving magnetic field. An electric generator produces electricity by electromagnetism.
Conductor Passing Through Magnetic Field
When a conductor passes through a magnetic field, electrons in the conductor are
forced to move, creating an electric current.
Electric Generator
Generators use the principle of electromagnetism to convert mechanical energy
into electrical energy.

Electrochemistry - Batteries
A flashlight battery is a common example of the electrochemical production of electricity. A battery is a group of voltaic cells. A
voltaic cell is a product of immersing two different metal electrodes in a chemical solution called electrolyte.
This creates a difference of potential between the two electrodes. Potential difference is the measure of the ability of a Unit of
electrical charge to do a certain amount of work.
Chemical Reaction
Chemical action transfers electrons between electrodes
Charge Separation
One electrode becomes positive, the other negative
Current Flow
Connecting a wire allows electric current to flow

Dry Cell Battery Structure
Flashlight batteries are dry cells. They have a liquid electrolyte, but it combines with other materials to form a paste. This allows the use of the cell in any
position.
Typical Dry Cell Battery
The zinc battery container is the negative electrode, and a carbon rod in the
centre of the cell is the positive electrode.
Internal Components
The space between the positive and negative electrodes contains a mixture
of carbon, manganese dioxide, and electrolyte. The top of the cell has a seal
to prevent evaporation, as the battery will not work when the electrolyte
dries out.

Piezoelectricity
Pressure Application
Force is applied to crystal materials
Electron Movement
Free electrons are driven out of orbit
Charge Creation
Positive and negative charges build up on opposite sides
Force from the application of pressure to certain crystal materials drives
the free electrons out of orbit. Positive and negative charges build up on
opposite sides of the material. You use this principle in such things as
spark igniters for gas barbecues.

Static vs. Dynamic Electricity
Static Electricity
In static electricity, electric charges are at rest. Static electricity normally does not perform useful work.
Dynamic Electricity (Electric Current)
To use electrical energy to do work, set the electrons in directed motion. When you make electrons to move in the same direction, they
produce an electric current.
The flow of electric current carries energy that can perform work. The more electrons that move in the same direction, the greater the
flow of current and the greater the amount of available energy.

Conducting Materials
Materials that conduct electricity well and have low electrical resistance are conductors. Most metals are good conductors, but some are better than others.
Silver is the best pure metal conductor, with copper second. Because of its relatively low cost, copper is most commonly usedfor wires.

Aluminum as a Conductor
Lightweight
Technicians use aluminum for high-voltage transmission lines because
it is much lighter than copper.
Cost-Effective
Aluminum is cheaper than copper, making it economical for large-scale
applications.
Structural Challenges
Pure aluminum is weak and could not support its own weight in
transmission lines.
Reinforced Design
Transmission conductors are made with one or more core strands of
steel cable, with strands of aluminum cable wrapped around them.

Conductor Heating
Heating Elements
Conductors heat up when current is flowing through them. This is a good thing in
the case of conductors that work as heating elements.
Transmission Conductors
Heating is not a good thing in the case of using conductors in electrical
transmission, as it represents energy loss and can damage insulation.

Insulating Materials
Plastic
Extensively used as electrical
insulation for household wiring.
Lower voltages require less
insulation, so relatively thin plastic
can be used.
Glass
Good insulator for very high
voltages. In long lengths, it provides
adequate insulation for
transmission lines.
Porcelain
Poor conductor of electricity,
extensively used as electrical
insulator for high voltage
applications.
Air
Functions as an insulator for very high voltages when
sufficient distance is maintained.
Oil
Used as an insulator in high voltage applications such as
transformers.

Transmission Line Insulators
For very high voltages, plastic is not an adequate insulator. At very high voltages, porcelain, glass, air, or oil function as
insulators.
Transmission Tower
A transmission tower
supporting a single
conductor. A long glass
holds away the conductor
from the metal of the
transmission tower.
Glass Insulators
Glass is a good insulator
and, in long lengths, it
provides adequate
insulation for very high
voltages.

Voltage and Insulation
Breakdown
Insulator Effectiveness
If the voltage is high enough, electricity can pass through almost any insulator.
Lightning Example
Lightning is an electric current that passes through long distances of air,
which is normally a poor conductor (a good insulator). To do this requires
billions of volts of electrical pressure.
Arcing Phenomenon
High-voltage electricity can arc or jump across an air gap from one point
to another if the voltage between the two points is strong enough.
Safety Precaution
For this reason, personnel must remain well clear of high-voltage
equipment.

Current Flow in a Conductor
To produce a flow of electricity or current in a conductor, make the electrons move in a direction along the conductor by
placing opposite (positive and negative) charges on the ends of the conductor. The free negative electrons move toward the
positive charge and away from the negative charge.
Free Electrons Flow
Free electrons flow in the
same direction in a
conductor to produce
electric current.
Electron Movement in
Copper
Copper's abundance of free
electrons makes it an
excellent conductor for
electric current.

Types of Current
Direct Current (DC)
When current flows in a constant direction, it is a direct current (dc).
Alternating Current (AC)
Alternating current (ac), on the other hand, regularly reverses direction and occurs during reversal of the polarity of each
end of the conductor, which is always the case with house current.

Speed of Electric Current
Light Speed Propagation
The effect of electric current moves down the conductor at the speed of light
(297,600 km per second).
Limited Electron Movement
Individual electrons do not move very far in the conductor.
Domino Effect
As each electron leaves its own orbit and enters another, it repels another
electron out of orbit, and so on.
Wave-Like Propagation
The rapidly moving current is the impulse of these changes moving along the
length of the conductor.
This is similar to the impulse of falling dominoes moving the length of the row, while
each domino makes only a slight movement.

Closed and Open Circuits
Placing a negative charge at one end of the wire repel away electrons to the other end of the wire. Current flows only until enough electrons accumulate at
the other end to produce an equal charge. At that point, no further current flows, and there is static electric charge on the conductor.
Complete or Closed Circuit
For electric current to flow, there must be opposite charges at the ends of
the conductor. Some kind of electrical energy source, such as a battery or
generator, supplies these charges.
Open Circuit
If the circuit breaks (opens) at any point, current stops flowing. An open
circuit can accidentally result from breaks or intentionally from switches or
disconnection.

How a Closed Circuit Works
Energy Source
Battery or generator provides opposite
charges
Negative Terminal
Electrons are repelled into the wire
Conductor
Electrons flow through the wire
Positive Terminal
Electrons are attracted to this end
At the negative side of the electrical energy source, electrons are repelled in the wire. At the positive side, the source attracts electrons.
While current flows in the circuit, electrical energy can do work-for example, heating a lamp filament to give light. If the circuit breaks
(opens) at any point, current stops flowing.

Conventional Flow
Historical Assumption
Traditional current flows from positive to
negative
Conventional Flow
This direction is still commonly used
Electromagnetism Rules
Based on conventional flow direction
Despite present knowledge about electron-flow, there has been an assumption that traditional current flows from positive to negative. This
direction is conventional flow and is still common. For example, the rules for electromagnetism, a topic for later discussion, are based on
conventional flow.

Open Circuit Examples
Broken Filament
When the filament in a lamp breaks, the lamp no longer lights because the circuit is open.
Light Switch
When the light switch is in the open position, the lamp no longer lights because the circuit is
intentionally opened.

Useful Effects of Electricity: Heat
When electric current passes through a wire, the temperature of the wire rises, and heat transfer gives off energy. Many household
appliances, such as toasters and electric heaters, use this effect.
Good conductors such as copper produce less heat, while poor ones such as tungsten produce a lot of heat when they conduct current.
Toaster
Electric toasters use resistive heating
elements that glow red-hot to toast bread.
Space Heater
Electric heaters convert electrical energy
into heat energy for warming spaces.
Light Bulb
Incandescent bulbs use tungsten filaments
that heat up to produce light.

Useful Effects of Electricity: Magnetism
Any conductor of electric current acts like a magnet. This interaction between electricity and magnetism is called
electromagnetism. When the current stops flowing, the conductor no longer acts as a magnet.
Electromagnet
An electromagnet is a type of magnet in
which the magnetic field is produced by
an electric current.
Electric Motor
Electric motors use electromagnetism
to convert electrical energy into
mechanical motion.
Relay
Relays use electromagnets to
mechanically operate switches, allowing
a low-power signal to control a high-
power circuit.

Useful Effects of Electricity:
Chemical Changes
The electroplating process uses an electric current to produce a metallic coating
on a surface. The electric current acts on a chemical solution, the electrolyte, to
deposit coating metal from the electrolyte onto the surface to be plated.
Preparation
Object to be plated is connected to negative terminal (cathode)
Electrolyte Bath
Object is immersed in solution containing metal ions
Current Application
Electric current causes metal ions to deposit on the object
Finished Product
A thin, even layer of metal coats the original object

Electroplating Applications
Jewelry
Gold plating provides a precious metal
finish at a fraction of the cost of solid
gold.
Automotive Parts
Chrome plating provides corrosion
resistance and an attractive finish to
metal components.
Electronics
Nickel plating improves conductivity
and corrosion resistance in electronic
components.

Attraction and Repulsion Review
The fundamental law of electrical charges states that like charges repel and unlike charges attract.
•Positive charges repel other positive charges
•Negative charges repel other negative charges
•Positive and negative charges attract each other
The strength of these forces depends on the amount of charge and the square of the distance between the charged objects.

source, through the load, and back to the positive terminal.

(switch) or unintentional (broken wire).
When a circuit is open, no current flows and electrical devices cannot operate.

Conventional vs. Electron Flow Review
Conventional Flow
Historically assumed to flow from positive to negative. Still commonly used in many electrical diagrams and explanations.

Electrostatic charges are stationary electric charges. They create electrostatic fields
around them, with forces of attraction between unlike charges and repulsion between

Insulator Applications Review
Household Wiring
Household wiring consists of pure
copper conductors with a plastic layer
of insulation. This insulation provides
protection from electric shock and
prevents short-circuiting of the system.
High Voltage Transmission
For very high voltages, porcelain, glass,
air, or oil function as insulators. Glass
insulators hold conductors away from
metal transmission towers.
Safety Equipment
Insulated tools and protective gear
prevent electrical shock when working
with live circuits.

the current stops flowing, the conductor no
longer acts as a magnet.
Motors, generators, relays, speakers
Chemical changesThe electroplating process uses an electric
current to produce a metallic coating on a
surface. The electric current acts on a chemical
solution, the electrolyte, to deposit coating
metal from the electrolyte onto the surface to
be plated.

Supply electrical energy in
several ways (e.g., a wet-

Potential Difference
The measure of the ability
(potential) of a unit of
electric charge to do a
certain amount of work
Electromotive Force (emf)
The force that drives the current, measured in volts (V)
The difference in potential between two terminals provides the force to
drive the current, similar to high and low-pressure points in a fluid piping
system.

Conductors and Resistance
Conductors
The ease with which a current flows through a conductor
varies. In DC circuits, the opposition that a material offers to
the flow of current is called resistance.
A conductor in a circuit should have low resistance, allowing
maximum current flow. Copper wire is the most commonly
used conductor.
Resistance
Materials with high resistance oppose the flow of current.
The unit of measurement of resistance is the ohm (Ω).
Some resistances are very large, requiring larger units like
kilohm (kΩ) or megohm (MΩ).
Some are small, measured in milliohm (mΩ) or microhm
(μΩ).

Load in Electrical Circuits
Definition
The load uses electrical energy to
do useful work such as producing
motion, light, or sound or providing
heating.
Resistance
The load usually has resistance in
the electrical circuit. The energy
source performs work by driving the
current through the resistive load.
Energy Demand
The term load also refers to the
amount of energy demanded from
the source. For example, when you
increase or decrease the load, it
means that the energy source is
supplying more or less energy.

Switches in Electrical Circuits
Function
A switch opens or closes an electric circuit as required. The
simplest type has two pieces of conducting metal connected to
the conductor of the circuit.
Relay Contacts
Contacts in an electrical relay function as switches in control
circuits. These contacts are either normally closed (NC) or
normally open (NO).
When you energize a relay, the contacts switch position to
energize or de-energize circuits.

Comparing Water Flow to Electrical Flow
Water Flow System
•Water pressure (psi or kPa)
•Water flow rate (gal/min or L/s)
•Pipe restrictions (diameter, fittings)
•Pump creates pressure difference
Electrical Circuit
•Electrical pressure (volts)
•Current flow (amperes)
•Conductor restrictions (resistance in ohms)
•Battery/generator creates potential difference
An electric circuit is like the flow of water through a piping system. For water to flow, there must be a pressure difference.
Similarly, for electricity to flow, there must be a potential difference.

Water Flow vs. Electrical Flow
Water Circuit (Top)
A pump circulates water through piping and back to the tank. The valve controls water flow. The pump develops
pressure that causes water to flow.
If the valve is fully open, there is little restriction to flow. If partially closed, water flow is reduced.
Electric Circuit (Bottom)
A battery acts like the pump in a water circuit. The variable resistor acts like a valve, adjusting resistance to current flow.
As resistance increases, less electricity flows through the circuit.

Factors Affecting Water Flow
1
Pressure Applied
The greater the pressure applied to the system, the greater the water flow
that will occur at a given resistance.
2
Pipe Restrictions
Restrictions include length and diameter of pipe, as well as the number of
fittings.
3
Pipe Diameter
More water will flow through larger-diameter pipe when the same
pressure is applied.
4
Pump Size
Maintaining pressure difference with larger pipes requires a larger pump.

Factors Affecting Electrical Flow
1
Potential Difference (Voltage)
The greater the voltage applied to the circuit, the greater the current flow at a
given resistance.
2
Conductor Restrictions
Restrictions include the cross-sectional area of the conductor and the type of
material.
3
Conductor Size
More current will flow through larger conductors when the same voltage is
applied.
4
Power Source Capacity
Maintaining voltage with larger conductors requires a more powerful energy
source.

Electrical Pressure Terminology

point with respect to another
Potential differenceDifference in potential between any
two points in a circuit
VoltageAlternative term for potential

Electromotive force (emf)Potential difference of an energy
source (for example, battery or
generator)
Voltage dropPotential difference across individual
loads in a circuit
Often, you use voltage interchangeably with potential difference and emf and never in
place of the term potential.

Ohm's Law
Ohm's law defines the relationship between current flow (amperes),
electrical pressure (volts), and resistance in a circuit (ohms):
Definition
The current flowing in an
electrical circuit is directly
proportional to the applied
voltage.
Relationship
As voltage increases,
current increases. As
resistance increases,
current decreases, and vice
versa.
Simple Expression
It takes an emf of 1 volt to push a current of 1 ampere through 1
ohm of resistance.

Ohm's Law Equations
Current (I)
I = E/R
Current equals voltage divided by
resistance
Resistance (R)
R = E/I
Resistance equals voltage divided
by current
Voltage (E)
E = I × R
Voltage equals current multiplied
by resistance
When any two of these quantities are known, it is simple to calculate the third. These equations use amperes, volts, and ohms.
If you use larger or smaller units, you must convert them first to these basic units.

Calculating Current Using
Ohm's Law
Identify Known Values
In this circuit, we have a 20-volt source of emf and a resistor with
resistance of 10 ohms.
Select the Appropriate Formula
To find current, use I = E/R
Substitute Values and Calculate
I = 20V/10Ω = 2A
A current of 2 amperes flows in this circuit. You might need to use a
calculation like this to see if the current in a circuit will exceed the safe
current rating of a resistor.

Calculating Resistance Using
Ohm's Law
Identify Known Values
With a 60-volt source of emf and a current of 5 amperes flowing in
the circuit.
Select the Appropriate Formula
To find resistance, use R = E/I
Substitute Values and Calculate
R = 60V/5A = 12Ω
The resistance in this circuit is 12 ohms. Resistance and current are
inversely proportional. Therefore, to double the current to 10 amperes,
halve the resistance by adjusting the rheostat to reduce resistance in the
circuit to 6 ohms.

Work and Power in Electrical Circuits
Work
Work is the process of changing one form of energy into
another. For example, a motor changes electrical energy
into kinetic energy, so it is doing work.
The unit of electrical work is the joule (J). A more common
unit of work is the kilowatt hour (kWh).
Power
Power is the rate at which work is done. The faster work is
done, the greater the power.
The unit of power (P) is watts (W) or horsepower (hp). A
watt is the consumed power when 1 ampere of current flows
through a potential difference of 1 volt in 1 second.

Power Units

1 kilowatt (1 kW)1000 W (= 10³ W)
1 megawatt (1 MW)1,000,000 W (= 10⁶ W)

Power in Water and Electrical Systems
Water System Power
The power of a pump is a function of the pressure that the
pump has developed and the flow of water.
A more powerful pump is needed to develop higher pressure
or to pump more water through the system.
Electrical System Power
In electric circuits, power is a function of current flow and
applied voltage.
Power increases if you increase the current or voltage.
Maintaining flow with large conductors and low resistance
requires a more powerful battery.

Power Calculation in DC
Circuits
Basic Formula
Power in watts = (current in
amperes) × (voltage in volts)
P = I × E
Derived Formulas
E = P/I
I = P/E
Example Calculation
If voltage is 60 volts and current is 5 amperes:
P = 5A × 60V = 300W
Therefore, the power of this circuit is 300 watts.

Series Circuits
Definition
Circuits that have only one
possible path for the
current flow. The same
amount of current flows
through every part of the
circuit.
Arrangement
The parts of the circuit
follow one after the other in
series in a single loop.
Example
Older forms of Christmas tree lights are connected in series. Each
lamp is a resistive load. If one lamp burns out, the entire string
goes out because the series circuit has been broken.

Voltage Drop in Series Circuits
Voltage Drop Definition
As electrons move from the
negative to the positive terminal,
they lose energy to the circuit
resistance. This occurrence is
voltage drop.
Total Voltage Drop
Total voltage drop in a circuit
equals the applied voltage of the
energy source. This is true for
circuits with one load or 20 loads.
Multiple Loads
If there are several loads, some
voltage drop occurs across each
load. The same current passes
through them all, so the voltage
drop across each load is
proportional to the resistance of
that load.

Calculating Voltage Drop in
Series Circuits
Identify Circuit Values
A series circuit has a total voltage of 48 volts and contains a 2-ohm resistor and
a 4-ohm resistor.
Calculate Total Resistance
Total resistance is 2Ω + 4Ω = 6Ω
Calculate Current
I = E/R = 48V/6Ω = 8A
Calculate Individual Voltage Drops
Voltage drop across 2-ohm resistor: E2 = I × R = 8A × 2Ω = 16V
Voltage drop across 4-ohm resistor: E4 = I × R = 8A × 4Ω = 32V
Note: The total voltage drop in the series circuit (48V) is the sum of the voltage drops
across the two resistors (16V + 32V).

Parallel Circuits
Definition
If some parts of a circuit are connected in parallel, the current is
not the same in all parts of the circuit.
Current Flow
Current flows through more than one complete path. These
paths are called branches. The supply voltage is common to
each branch.
Circuit Continuity
If one branch of a parallel circuit becomes open, current still
flows through the other branches. For example, ordinary house
lamps are connected in parallel; if one burns out, the rest stay lit.
Energy Sources
Energy sources as well as loads may be connected in parallel.
Sources connected in parallel maintain the same terminal
voltage, but supply greater amounts of current.

Current Flow in Parallel Circuits
Multiple Paths
In a parallel circuit, there are multiple possible complete paths for the
current to flow through between the terminals.
Current Distribution
The sum of the currents in each branch equals the supply current.
Branch Failure
If one load burns out, current can still flow through the other branches.
Source Disconnection
If the energy source is disconnected, no current flows in any of the
branches.

Resistance in Parallel
Circuits
Total Resistance
Formula
In a parallel circuit, you can
calculate the total resistance
(RT) using the following
formula:
1/RT = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + ...
Alternative Calculation
If the total current and voltage
of a parallel circuit are known,
you can calculate the total
resistance from Ohm's law:
RT = ET/IT
Effect on Circuit
When resistances are connected in parallel, they reduce overall
opposition to current flow.

Voltage in Parallel Circuits
Common Voltage
Parallel loads are
connected directly across
the same energy source.
This means that, when
loads are connected in
parallel, the entire source
voltage is applied across
each branch.
Key Feature
This is the most important
and useful feature of a
parallel circuit, because all
loads are supplied with a
common voltage.
Current Distribution
The current in each branch is inversely proportional to the
resistance of the load in the branch (Ohm's law). Branches with
less resistance carry more current and vice versa.

Example of Parallel Circuit Calculation
Initial Circuit
In a simple circuit with a 6-volt power source and a resistance of 3 ohms, a current of 2 amps flows.
Adding Parallel Resistance
Another load, with a resistance of 4 ohms, is connected in parallel with the first one.
Current Through First Resistor
A current of 2 amperes still flows through the 3-ohm resistor.
Current Through Second Resistor
A current of 1.5 amperes now also flows through the 4-ohm resistor.
Total Current
Total current flow (IT) in the circuit has increased to 3.5 amperes.

Series-Parallel Circuits
Definition
Circuits that combine series
and parallel connections are
called series-parallel
circuits.
Analysis Approach
You can systematically
break down series-parallel
or combination circuits into
series and parallel
components.
Applicable Laws
The same laws that apply to individual series and parallel circuits
are applicable to the analysis of series-parallel circuits.

Example of Series-Parallel Circuit
Circuit Structure
In the series-parallel circuit in Figure 3-14a:
•Resistors R2 and R3 (the first parallel component) are in
parallel, but only with each other.
•Resistors R4 and R5 (the second parallel component) are
also in parallel, but only with each other.
•These two parallel components of the circuit are in series
with one another and with resistors R1 and R6.
Equivalent Circuit
To analyze this circuit:
•Calculate parallel resistors R2 and R3 as an equivalent
single resistance (R23).
•Calculate the other parallel component (R4 and R5) as a
single equivalent resistance (R45).
•After substituting the two pairs of parallel resistances
with their equivalent resistances, you have a simple
series circuit.

Calculating Circuit Resistance in Series-Parallel Circuits
Identify Series and Parallel Components
In Figure 3-15a, resistors R2, R3, and R4 form a series circuit that is in parallel with resistor R5.
Calculate Equivalent Resistances
Calculate resistors R2, R3, and R4 as a single equivalent resistance R234.
Combine Parallel Components
The parallel combination of R234 and R5 becomes the single equivalent resistance, R2345.
Create Simple Series Circuit
Connect R2345 in series with R1 and R6 to produce a simple series circuit.
Calculate Total Resistance
Calculate the total resistance using the series circuit law (RT = R1 + R2345 + R6).

Calculating Current in Series-
Parallel Circuits
Determine Total Resistance
Once you determine the total circuit resistance, you can calculate the
total line current by using Ohm's law (I = E ÷ R).
Calculate Voltage Drops
Calculate the individual voltage drops across the resistances using
the following equations:
E1 = IT × R1
E2345 = IT × R2345
E6 = IT × R6
Verify Total Voltage
The sum of E1 + E2345 + E6 = ET.

Calculating Branch Currents
in Series-Parallel Circuits
Use Voltage Drop
You can use the voltage drop E2345 to calculate the branch currents.
Equal Voltage in Parallel Branches
For the parallel component of this series-parallel circuit, the voltage
drops across the two branches are the same.
Calculate Branch Currents
I234 = E2345 ÷ R234
I5 = E2345 ÷ R5
Verify Total Current
IT = I5 + I234 for the parallel portion.

Magnetic Materials
Ferromagnetic
Materials
Magnetism is the property
certain materials have that
allows them to attract other
magnetic materials. These
are called ferromagnetic
materials.
Natural
Ferromagnetic Metals
Iron, nickel, and cobalt are
the only naturally occurring
ferromagnetic metals.
(Steel is ferromagnetic but
is made from iron.)
Types of Magnets
Magnets that retain their magnetic effects are permanent
magnets. Those that do not retain their magnetic effects are
temporary magnets.

Electrons, Molecules, and Magnetism
Electron Spin and Magnetism
Any conductor of electric current acts like a magnet. In fact, it is spinning electrons that cause
magnetic forces.
In most atoms, electrons tend to pair off in orbits that have spins in opposite directions. Each spin
produces a tiny magnetic field and the magnetic fields of these pairs cancel each other.
Magnetic Materials
In a magnetic material, electrons with similar spins can pair off. Their magnetic fields add together and
the molecules of the material have a net magnetic field.
When a ferromagnetic material is not magnetized, its molecules are randomly oriented. Their
magnetic effects work in different directions and cancel each other.

Magnetized Materials
Unmagnetized State
When a ferromagnetic material is not magnetized, its molecules are randomly
oriented. Their magnetic effects work in different directions and cancel each
other.
Magnetized State
In a magnetized metal, the molecules are aligned with each other so that the
magnetic effects of the molecules all work together. This produces a strong
magnet.
Partially Magnetized
If a magnetic material is partially magnetized, only some of the molecules are
aligned. This produces a weak magnet.
Losing Magnetism
If the molecules of a magnet become misaligned again, the material loses its
magnetism. This can gradually happen. It can also happen if the magnet
becomes very hot or receives a strong physical shock.

Magnetic Polarity
Magnetic Poles
The magnetic field is strongest at each end of a magnet. These ends are what you call the poles of the
magnet.
The Earth itself acts like a giant magnet and has a magnetic north pole and south pole.
North and South Seeking Poles
When you suspend a magnet so that it is free to move, it will turn so that one pole always points toward
the Earth's North Pole.
In the past, this was the north-seeking pole of the magnet and diagrams show this with an N. The other
pole was the south-seeking pole and this comes with an S in diagrams.

Compass Operation
Compass Principle
The interaction of a magnet with
the earth's magnetic effect is the
operating principle of a compass.
The needle of a compass is a small
permanent magnet that indicates
its north-seeking pole.
Compass Direction
Regardless of the direction
towards which the compass turns,
its needle always swivels to point
north.
Law of Attraction and Repulsion
If the north poles of two magnets point toward each other, they repel each
other. Two south poles also repel each other. On the other hand, a north and
a south pole attract each other.
Like poles repel, unlike poles attract.

Magnetic Fields and Lines of Force
Magnetic Field Definition
A magnetic field consists of lines of force that interact with
magnetic substances. The most common magnetic
substances are iron and steel.
You can make iron magnetic but it will lose its magnetism
quickly. Steel, on the other hand, remains magnetic for a
longer period.
Permanent Magnets
Magnetized metal bars are what you call permanent
magnets. There are different types of permanent magnets:
•A bar magnet
•A horseshoe magnet
Permanent magnets appear to be ordinary pieces of steel.
Even close observation will not reveal any visible signs of
magnetism.

Types of Permanent Magnets
Bar Magnet
A straight bar of magnetized material with north and south poles at opposite ends.
The magnetic field extends from the north pole to the south pole, creating a characteristic pattern of magnetic lines of
force.
Horseshoe Magnet
A magnet bent into a U-shape, bringing the north and south poles closer together.
This concentrates the magnetic field between the poles, creating a stronger magnetic effect in that region.

Magnetic Force and Fields
Action at a Distance
The magnetic force can act at a distance without contact. It can act
in the magnetic field, the area that surrounds the magnet.
Lines of Force
In the magnetic field, the force acts in lines of force or flux lines.
Affected Materials
The magnetic field will only affect magnetic material such as iron,
steel, nickel, and cobalt.
Invisible Force
If you bring any iron or steel object close to the magnet, the invisible
magnetic field will pull it toward the magnet.

Visualizing Magnetic Fields
Iron Filings Experiment
Although flux lines are not visible, you can see if you place a small
magnet under a sheet of paper and sprinkle iron filings over the
top of it.
When you tap the paper gently, the iron filings move slightly to
align themselves along the flux lines.
Characteristics of Flux Lines
Notice that flux lines are:
•More concentrated at the two poles (the magnetic field and
force is stronger here)
•Farther apart at greater distances from the magnet (the
magnetic field and force is weaker here)
•Curved and do not cross

Permeability of Materials
Definition of
Permeability
The ease with which a material
accepts magnetic lines of
force is what you call its
permeability.
High Permeability
Materials
Iron and steel have high
permeability, meaning they
readily accept magnetic lines
of force.
Low Permeability Materials
Air, on the other hand, has low permeability, meaning it does not
readily accept magnetic lines of force.

Interaction of Magnetic Fields
Combined Flux Patterns
When you bring together two magnets, their magnetic fields
interact. You can clearly see the way the flux lines combine using
iron filings.
Magnets always have north and south poles. The magnetic lines of
force extend from the north pole of a magnet to the south pole.
Magnetic Attraction and Repulsion
The poles react with each other. If you bring two north or two south
poles together, they will repel or push away each other.
If a north pole and a south pole come together, however, they will
attract and stick together (like poles repel and unlike poles attract).
You use this magnetic field effect to operate electric motors,
generators, and other devices.

Magnetic Strength and Flux
Density
Varying Magnetic
Strength
Some magnets are stronger
than others. A stronger
magnet pulls harder and is
harder to separate from a
magnetic substance.
Lines of Force
If you place a stronger
magnet under the iron
filings, more lines of force
will show. The stronger the
magnet, the more lines of
magnetic force produced.
Flux and Flux Density
These lines are what you call flux, and their concentration is what
you call flux density.

Direction of Flux Lines
Flux Direction
Convention
Lines of force are considered
to emerge from the magnet's
north pole and move toward
the south pole. Diagrams show
the direction using arrows.
Complete Magnetic
Circuit
They travel from south to
north within the magnet to
form a closed loop.
Compass Indication
The direction of flux lines is the direction in which the north-seeking
pole of a compass would point.

Principles of Basic Electromagnetism
Definition of Electromagnetism
Electromagnetism is magnetism that results from the
movement of electrons.
Whenever current flows in a conductor, a magnetic field
forms around the conductor.
Electromagnetic Induction
If you move a conductor within a magnetic field, the
movement will induce a voltage and current will flow in the
conductor.
Electric currents and magnetic fields are inseparable. In the
area where current flows, there are always magnetic fields.

Characteristics of Electromagnets
Current Dependency
Electromagnets depend upon
current flow for their magnetism.
If current flow decreases, so
does the magnetism.
Polarity Determination
The direction of current flow
determines the polarity of the
magnet.
On/Off Capability
If the current is turned off, the
electromagnet is no longer
magnetic.

Electromagnetism in a Straight Wire
Compass Detection
If you move around a compass near a straight wire
conductor, it shows the presence and direction of a
magnetic field.
The flux lines encircle the wire.
Current Direction Effect
If the direction of current flow changes, the direction of the
magnetic field also changes.
You use a simple rule to work out the direction of the
magnetic lines of force around a wire.

The Right-Hand Rule
Determining Magnetic
Field Direction
Imagine grasping the wire with
your right hand. If your thumb
points in the direction of
conventional current flow, your
fingers wrap around the wire in
the direction of the magnetic
lines of force.
Right-Hand Rule
Application
This simple technique allows
you to predict the direction of
the magnetic field around any
current-carrying conductor.
Practical Importance
Understanding the relationship between current direction and
magnetic field direction is crucial for designing and troubleshooting
electromagnetic devices.

Magnetic Forces Between Conductors
Same Direction Current
If the current is flowing in the same
direction, the magnetic lines of force
around the wires would be in
opposition and the two wires would
attract each other.
Opposite Direction Current
If the current is flowing in opposite
directions, the magnetic lines of force
around the wires would be similar and
the two wires would oppose each
other.
High Current Risks
When very large currents can flow
through conductors, the resulting
magnetic forces can damage the
conductors.

Electromagnetism in a Coil of Wire
Concentrated Magnetic Field
If a wire is coiled in a spiral (helically),
the magnetic field is concentrated in
the centre of the coil.
Steel Core Enhancement
If you have wound the wire around a
steel bar, the resulting magnet can be
very strong.
Field Shape
The shape of the magnetic field of a
coil is like a large bar magnet. The
lines of force leave the north pole at
one end of the coil and pass toward
the south pole at the other end.

Right-Hand Rule for Coils
Finding Coil Polarity
You can use another right-
hand rule to find the direction
of the magnetic field of a coil.
Application Method
Imagine grasping the coil with
your right hand: If the fingers
wrap in the direction of
conventional current flow
around the coil, the thumb
then points in the direction of
the north pole of the coil.
Practical Use
This rule helps determine which end of an electromagnet will be the
north pole and which will be the south pole based on the direction of
current flow.

Strength of a Coil's Magnetic Field
Coil Winding Density
A closely wound coil creates a stronger magnetic field.
Core Material
Because the permeability of iron is much higher than air, permanently placing an
iron or steel core inside the wire coil makes the magnetic field of a coil even
stronger.
Current Magnitude
Increasing the current flowing through the coil increases the strength of the
magnetic field.
Number of Turns
More turns in the coil result in a stronger magnetic field for the same current.

Making an Electromagnet
Core Selection
Using an iron core in a coil is the basis for making an
electromagnet. A coil is wound around a core of steel with a
low carbon content (or iron).
This has high permeability but does not retain much
magnetism after the current stops flowing, removing the
magnetic field.
Applications of Electromagnets
You use various sizes of electromagnet in many ways in the
home and in industry. You use them in:
•Motors
•Generators
•Clocks
•Voltage testers
•Solenoid and relay Units in control circuits
•Cranes for lifting scrap metal, etc.

Electricity and Magnetism
Inseparable
Relationship
Magnetism and electric
current are inseparable. The
flow of current through a
conductor (wire) produces a
magnetic field around that
conductor.
Direct Current Effects
If the electric current flow is
constant, as with DC current,
the magnetic field is constant,
and the product is a magnet.
Alternating Current Effects
With alternating current, the magnetic field changes direction every
time that the current flow changes direction.

Current Flow and Magnetic Field
Circuit with Variable Resistance
In this circuit, a wire is connected to the terminals of a battery with a variable resistor and a switch.
When the switch is closed, electric current flows through the wire in one direction. This current flow produces a weak magnetic field
around the wire.
Effects of Current Changes
Since the electric current flow is always in the same direction, the magnetic field is set up in one direction. If you switch the battery
terminals, the current flow is reversed and the magnetic field is set up in the opposite direction.
When the switch is in open position, current flow stops. This causes the magnetic field to collapse. Although the field collapses very
quickly, it does take time.

Current Magnitude and Magnetic
Field Strength
Circuit Activation
When the switch is closed, current begins to flow through the circuit.
Resistance Adjustment
If the switch is closed and the variable resistance adjusted, the current
flow will change.
Increasing Current
As the resistance lowers, the current flow increases.
Magnetic Field Strengthening
When the current flow increases, the magnetic field surrounding the
wire strengthens.

Coiled Wire and Electromagnets
Coil Formation
If you wind the wire into a coil, it will form several conductors arranged side by side, with current flowing through each.
A magnet that is a product of passing an electric current through a conductor is an electromagnet.
Advantages of Electromagnets
Electromagnets have major advantages compared with permanent magnets:
•They do not become weaker with use
•Controlling the current flow can control the strength of the magnet

Combined Magnetic Fields in Coils
1
Individual Wire Contribution
Each wire in the coil carries the current flow through it. Therefore, each loop of
the coil generates a small magnetic field around itself.
2
Field Alignment
Since the electric current flows in the same direction through each loop, the
magnetic field around each wire extends in the same direction.
3
Combined Effect
These small magnetic fields combine to produce a single, larger field. The
strength of the larger field depends on the number of loops in the coil.
4
Strengthening Methods
You can strengthen a magnetic field by increasing the applied voltage or by
increasing the number of loops in the coil.

Solenoid Operation
Coil with Iron Plunger
If you place a magnetic plunger, such as a soft iron bar, inside a
coil of wire in a DC circuit.
Circuit Activation
When the switch is closed, current flows through the coil.
Magnetic Field Generation
The current flow produces a magnetic field within and around
the coil.
Plunger Movement
The magnetic field produced will attract the iron bar, pulling it
to the centre of the coil.

Solenoid Applications
Motor Contactors
Solenoids are used in motor
contactors to mechanically
connect or disconnect
electrical circuits, allowing for
remote control of motors.
Solenoid Valves
In fluid control systems,
solenoid valves use
electromagnetic force to
control the flow of liquids or
gases through pipes and
tubes.
Relays
Electromagnetic relays use solenoids to open or close electrical
contacts, allowing a low-power circuit to control a high-power
circuit.

Magnetic Permeability in Coils
Magnetic Circuit Analogy
A magnetic field is a bit like an electric circuit. Magnetic lines
pass through a magnetic conductor better than through a
magnetic insulator.
Air vs. Iron Core
Air has a high magnetic resistance. For that reason, an air-
filled coil will not produce as strong a magnet as a coil that is
wrapped around an iron core.
Iron is a better conductor of magnetism and is said to be
more permeable.

AC Current and Magnetic
Fields
Universal Magnetic
Effect
Electric current flow through
any conductor produces a
magnetic field around the
conductor. This is true for
alternating current as well as
for direct current.
Alternating Field
Direction
With alternating current,
however, the magnetic field
changes direction every time
that the current flow changes
direction.
Mechanical Effects
The rapid switching of magnetic fields can cause vibration in AC
electric machines. This explains why some machines, such as
transformers, sometimes hum as the iron parts vibrate.

Magnetic Relay
Relay Structure
A magnetic relay consists of an electromagnet (coil) and a
set of electrical contacts that can be opened or closed by
the magnetic field.
Operation Principle
When current flows through the coil, it creates a magnetic
field that attracts a movable armature, which in turn
operates the electrical contacts.
Applications
Relays are used in control circuits to allow a low-power
signal to control a higher-power circuit, providing electrical
isolation between the two circuits.

Electromagnetic Induction
Reciprocal Relationship
As mentioned previously, the flow of an electric current flows through a conductor produces a magnetic field around
that conductor.
It is also true that the movement of a magnetic field across a conductor generates voltage is generated in that
conductor.
U-Shaped Electromagnet Example
Figure 4-14 shows a u-shaped electromagnet. The supply of direct current to the coil around the iron core produces an
electromagnet.
Magnetic flux lines pass between the poles of the magnet through the opening in the core. These form north and south
poles on the magnet.
The movement of a conductor across the magnetic field, as indicated, generates voltage in that conductor. The
voltmeter connected across the conductor shows this voltage.

Factors Affecting Induced
Voltage
Voltage Magnitude
The voltage generated is very small, but is measurable with a sensitive meter.
Flux Line Cutting
The voltage generated depends on the number of lines of flux that the
conductor cuts every second and on the angle at which the conductor cuts the
flux.
Speed Effect
The faster the movement of the conductor, the greater the voltage produced.
Flux Density Effect
Increasing the concentration of magnetic flux lines (flux density) increases the
induced voltage, with the conductor moving at a constant speed.

Power Generation Application
Industrial Scale Application
You use the same principle to
generate large amounts of electric
energy in power stations.
Generator Operation
In power stations, large generators
use powerful electromagnets and
rapidly rotating conductors to
produce electricity on an industrial
scale.
Energy Conversion
This process converts mechanical
energy (from steam turbines, water
turbines, or wind turbines) into
electrical energy through
electromagnetic induction.

Applications of Electromagnets
Electric Motors
Electric motors use electromagnets to
convert electrical energy into
mechanical motion. The interaction
between the magnetic fields of
stationary electromagnets and rotating
components creates rotational force.
Lifting Cranes
Industrial cranes use powerful
electromagnets to lift and move
ferromagnetic materials like scrap
metal. The magnetism can be turned on
and off as needed, making loading and
unloading efficient.
Medical Equipment
MRI machines use superconducting
electromagnets to generate powerful
magnetic fields that allow detailed
imaging of the human body's internal
structures.

Solenoid Valve Applications
Gas Control Systems
Solenoid valves are critical components in gas control
systems, where they regulate the flow of gas based on
electrical signals.
When current flows through the solenoid coil, it creates a
magnetic field that moves a plunger, which opens or closes
the valve.
Advantages for Gas Technicians
For gas technicians and fitters, understanding solenoid
valves is essential because:
•They provide remote control of gas flow
•They can be integrated with safety systems
•They allow for automated operation
•They can quickly shut off gas flow in emergency
situations

Relay Operation in Control
Circuits
Signal Reception
A small control current is applied to the relay coil from a low-voltage control
circuit.
Electromagnetic Activation
The current in the coil creates a magnetic field that attracts the armature.
Contact Operation
The moving armature mechanically operates the electrical contacts,
either opening or closing them.
Power Circuit Control
The contacts control a separate high-power circuit, allowing the
low-power control signal to safely manage high-power devices.

Demagnetization Methods
Heating
When a magnetic material is heated above its Curie temperature, the thermal
energy disrupts the alignment of magnetic domains, causing it to lose its
magnetism.
Physical Shock
Strong physical impacts can disrupt the alignment of magnetic domains in a
material, reducing or eliminating its magnetism.
Alternating Current
Exposing a magnet to a decreasing alternating magnetic field gradually
randomizes the orientation of magnetic domains.
Natural Decay
Over time, some magnetic materials gradually lose their magnetism due to
thermal effects and external magnetic influences.

Magnetic Shielding
Principle of Operation
Magnetic shielding works by redirecting magnetic field lines
around the area to be protected, rather than blocking them.
Materials with high permeability provide a path of least
resistance for magnetic flux, drawing the field lines through
the shielding material instead of the protected space.
Applications
Magnetic shielding is used in various applications:
•Protecting sensitive electronic equipment
•Shielding medical devices from external magnetic
interference
•Containing magnetic fields in transformers and motors
•Preventing electromagnetic interference between
components

Magnetic Hysteresis
Definition
Magnetic hysteresis is the tendency of a magnetic material to retain its magnetization
after the magnetizing force is removed.
Hysteresis Loop
The hysteresis loop is a graph showing how the magnetic flux density (B) in a material
changes as the magnetizing force (H) is varied.
Energy Loss
The area inside the hysteresis loop represents energy lost as heat during each
magnetization cycle, which is important in transformer and motor design.
Material Selection
Materials with narrow hysteresis loops (soft magnetic materials) are used in
transformers to minimize energy losses, while materials with wide loops (hard magnetic
materials) are used for permanent magnets.

Magnetic Domain Theory
Atomic Level Magnetism
In ferromagnetic materials, atoms have unpaired electrons that create tiny magnetic moments.
Domain Formation
These atoms naturally group into regions called domains, where all atomic magnetic moments are aligned in the same direction.
Unmagnetized State
In an unmagnetized material, domains are randomly oriented, and their magnetic effects cancel out.
Magnetization Process
When exposed to an external magnetic field, domains aligned with the field grow at the expense of others, resulting in net magnetization.

Lenz's Law
Definition
Lenz's Law states that the
direction of an induced current
is always such that it creates a
magnetic field that opposes the
change that produced it.
Conservation of Energy
This law is a consequence of the
conservation of energy. If the
induced current created a field
that enhanced the original
change, it would create a self-
reinforcing system that
generated energy from nothing.
Practical Applications
Lenz's Law explains the operation of generators, transformers, and
eddy current brakes, and helps predict the behavior of electromagnetic
systems.

Eddy Currents
Formation Mechanism
When a changing magnetic field passes through a
conductive material, it induces circulating currents called
eddy currents within the material.
These currents flow in closed loops perpendicular to the
magnetic field, following Lenz's Law to oppose the change
that created them.
Effects and Applications
Eddy currents have several important effects:
•They cause heating in the conductor (used in induction
heating)
•They create opposing magnetic fields (used in
electromagnetic braking)
•They result in energy losses in transformers and motors
•They're used in non-destructive testing to detect flaws in
materials

Transformer Principle
Primary Current

Core Magnetization
The iron core concentrates and
directs the magnetic flux
Secondary Induction

Voltage Transformation

turns ratio between coils

Electric Motor Operation
Current Supply
Electric current flows through the motor's coil windings, creating
electromagnetic fields.
Magnetic Interaction
These electromagnetic fields interact with permanent magnets or
other electromagnets in the motor.
Force Generation
The interaction between magnetic fields creates forces that
cause rotation of the motor's rotor.
Continuous Rotation
Commutation systems or electronic controls continuously
change the direction of current flow to maintain rotation.

Magnetic Field Safety
Considerations
Medical Devices
Strong magnetic fields can interfere with pacemakers, implantable defibrillators,
and other medical implants.
Electronic Media
Magnetic fields can erase or damage information stored on magnetic media like
credit cards, hard drives, and magnetic identification cards.
Ferromagnetic Tools
Tools made of ferromagnetic materials can become projectiles in strong
magnetic fields, posing serious safety hazards.
Electronic Equipment
Sensitive electronic equipment can malfunction when exposed to magnetic
fields, potentially causing control system failures.

All electromagnetic waves are created by oscillating electric and magnetic fields that are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of

Electromagnetic Compatibility
Definition
Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) refers to the ability of
electronic equipment to function correctly in its
electromagnetic environment without introducing
intolerable electromagnetic disturbances to other
equipment.
This is particularly important in gas control systems where
electromagnetic interference could affect safety-critical
components.
Key Considerations
For gas technicians working with control systems, EMC
involves:
•Ensuring proper shielding of sensitive components

Summary of Magnetism and Electromagnetism
Understanding the principles of magnetism and electromagnetism is essential for gas technicians and fitters. These principles underpin the operation of many
devices used in gas systems, including electric motors, solenoid valves, and relay units in control circuits. By mastering these concepts, technicians can effectively
install, maintain, and troubleshoot these critical components, ensuring safe and efficient operation of gas systems.

CSA Unit 5
Chapter 5
Theory of Direct and
Alternating Current
The gas technician/fitter requires knowledge of direct and alternating
current theory in order to properly size, connect, and troubleshoot the
type of electrical equipment encountered in the gas industry. This
presentation covers the fundamentals of direct and alternating current,
leading and lagging in AC circuits, and capacitance in AC circuits.

differences between DC and AC

and back again to zero

Direct Current (DC)
What is Direct Current?
Direct current (DC) is electric current that flows in one direction only. When a circuit is connected to a DC source like a
battery, the current flows from one terminal to the other in the same direction.
Batteries have a positive and a negative terminal. The battery shown in the example has a voltage of 12 V.
Common DC Applications
•Electronic devices
•Small appliances
•Automobile electrical systems
DC is often supplied by batteries, which have a limited supply of electrical power and must be replaced or recharged
regularly.

Alternating Current (AC)
What is Alternating Current?
Alternating current (AC) is electric current that flows
alternately in both directions. The flow changes or
alternates direction rapidly and constantly.
In North America, generators produce and transmit
electrical energy as alternating current with a frequency of
60 hertz (cycles per second). This means that the current
flows in one direction for 1/120th of a second and then in the
other direction for 1/120th of a second.
Unlike DC where one terminal is always negative and the
other positive, AC constantly changes direction. Most
motors and other devices in homes and industry operate
using alternating current.

Why AC is Widely Used
Versatility
AC is more versatile than DC and is usable in a wide
variety of ways.
Cost-Effective
It is cheaper to produce than DC.
Long-Distance Transmission
It allows transmission of electricity over long distances
more economically.
Voltage Transformation
It easily transforms into lower or higher voltages for use in
various equipment.
Energy Efficiency
Transmission of AC energy at high voltage and low
current keeps energy losses to a minimum.
Flexibility
Many combinations of voltage and current can produce
the same energy level.

AC Generator Principles
Magnetic Field Interaction
A conductor moved in a magnetic field, or vice versa, crosses the
flux lines.
Electron Movement
The field applies a force to the free electrons in the conductor,
moving them.
Voltage Generation
The moving electrons result in a potential difference across
the ends of the conductor.

Factors Affecting Generated
Voltage
Magnetic Field Strength
Stronger magnetic fields produce higher voltages
Conductor Speed
Faster movement through flux lines increases voltage
Cutting Angle
The angle at which the conductor cuts the flux lines affects
voltage

Simple Generator Operation
Power Source
An outside power source such as flowing water, an internal
combustion engine, or steam turns the coil.
Magnetic Flux Cutting
As the loop rotates, the wire cuts the magnetic flux lines,
generating a voltage at the ends of the loop.
Voltage Transfer
The generator transfers the voltage to an external circuit
via slip rings and brushes. These maintain proper electrical
contact while allowing free rotation of the loop.

The AC Waveform
Sinusoidal Wave
A complete cycle of alternating current goes from zero to a
maximum positive value, back through zero to a maximum
negative value, and back again to zero. The voltage makes a
similar pattern, rather like a wave.
The correct name for the shape of this waveform is
sinusoidal or a sine wave.
At any point on this sine wave, the magnitude of the voltage
(or current) is the distance to the time axis. When the
waveform is below the zero line, the current has reversed
direction.

Waveform Characteristics
Symmetrical Pattern
Note that the waveform is the same shape above and below
the horizontal axis (symmetrical)—the positive and negative
parts vary in the same way.
The horizontal axis can be divided into degrees of rotation
rather than units of time. One complete rotation or cycle
equals 360°.
This graph shows how the output voltage (or current) of the
generator varies with the position of the rotor.

In Canada, standard AC electrical power goes through 60 complete cycles each
second. That is, its frequency is 60 cycles per second or 60 hertz (60 Hz). A
simple generator would turn 60 times each second to produce power at 60 hertz.

Phase in AC Circuits
What is Phase?
Phase can be described as the difference in electrical degrees
between two waveforms.
Single-Phase Generator
A single-phase generator produces one alternating (sinusoidal)
voltage waveform.
Three-Phase Generator
Three-phase generators are connected to provide three separate
circuits. Each of these circuits carries a sinusoidal voltage
waveform. The three waveforms are displaced by 120° from each
other.

Three-Phase Generator Windings
Three-Phase Configuration
Three-phase generators have three separate windings that produce three voltage waveforms
displaced by 120° from each other.
This configuration provides more efficient power generation and transmission compared to
single-phase systems.
The windings and voltages of a three-phase, AC generator as shown in Figure 5-5.

Calculating Alternating Current
Root-Mean-Square (RMS) Values
Alternating current is calculated by determining the effective work
that the electric current performs or heat it generates. This is
referred to as root-mean-square or RMS current.
RMS current is the peak current (Imax or Im) divided by square root
of 2 (0.707):
Irms = 0.707 × Imax
Similarly for voltage:
Vrms = 0.707 × Vmax
Residential voltages in North America are 120 V, which is the RMS
voltage. The actual supplied voltage is alternating according to a
sine curve with a peak of approximately 170 V.

Circuit Characteristics
Every real electrical circuit exhibits a combination of resistance, inductance, and capacitance. The nature of the circuit determines which of these
quantities predominates. Whichever quantity predominates, the other two are always present to some extent or other—although, from a
practical point of view, at least one of the others is so insignificant that you may ignore it.

Purely Resistive Circuit
Current and Voltage Relationship
When an AC current flows through pure resistance, a voltage-drop (VR) occurs
across that resistance. You use Ohm's law to calculate the value of that voltage-
drop: VR = IR.
When the current is maximum, the corresponding voltage-drop is also maximum;
as the current falls to zero and reverses direction, the resulting voltage-drop also
falls to zero and changes direction.
In a purely resistive circuit, the current and voltage are in phase with each other.
The phasor diagram shows the current and voltage phasors lie along the same
direction because they are in phase.

Purely Inductive Circuit
Current and Voltage Relationship
When an AC current flows through pure inductance, a voltage (VL) appears across that
inductance. The opposition to current is inductive-reactance (XL), so VL = I × XL.
The changing current induces the voltage (VL) into the inductance. The greater the rate of
change of current, the greater this voltage. The greatest rate of change occurs as the current
passes through zero, so this is where the maximum voltage occurs.
In a purely inductive circuit, the current peaks behind the voltage by 90°. It is said to lag the
voltage by 90°. The phasor diagram shows a 90°angle between the current and voltage phasors.

Purely Capacitive Circuit
Current and Voltage Relationship
When an AC current flows through pure capacitance, a voltage (VC) appears across
that capacitance. The opposition to current is capacitive-reactance (XC), so VC = I ×
XC.
The voltage (VC) builds up across the plates of the capacitor as the current flows
onto those plates. This voltage increases as the current decreases and reaches its
maximum value as the current falls to zero.
In a purely capacitive circuit, the current peaks ahead of the voltage by 90°. It is said
to lead the voltage by 90°. The phasor diagram shows a 90° angle between the
current and voltage phasors.

Phase Relationships Summary
Resistive Circuit
Current and voltage are in phase (0° phase difference)
Inductive Circuit
Current lags voltage by 90°
Capacitive Circuit
Current leads voltage by 90°

Resistive-Inductive (R-L) Circuit
Combined Effect
Many real circuits are resistive-inductive (R-L) circuits. An
R-L circuit is one that has both resistance and inductance.
If the current in a purely resistive circuit is in phase with the
voltage-drop, and the current in a purely inductive circuit
lags the voltage-drop by 90°, then it follows that, in an R-L
circuit, the current will lag the voltage by some angle
between 0° and 90°.
This angle is called the phase angle (φ, Greek letter phi).
Exactly what this angle will be depends on the values of the
circuit's resistance and inductive-reactance.

Resistive-Capacitive (R-C) Circuit
Combined Effect
Less common than R-L circuits, R-C circuits are those that have
both resistance and capacitance.
Current in an R-C circuit leads the voltage by some angle (the
phase-angle, φ) between 0° and 90°.
The exact phase angle depends on the relative values of resistance
and capacitive reactance in the circuit.

Resistance in Electrical Circuits
Definition
In purely resistive circuits, the opposition to current is resistance. Resistance (R)
depends upon the length, cross-sectional area, and material of a conductor.
Measurement
Resistance is measured in ohms (Ω).
Ohm's Law
The relationship between voltage, current, and resistance is defined by Ohm's Law:
V = I × R
Applications
Resistance predominates in heating circuits and other applications where electrical
energy is converted to heat.

Reactance in Electrical Circuits
Definition
In purely inductive or capacitive circuits, the opposition to
current is called reactance. There are two types:
•Inductive reactance (XL)
•Capacitive reactance (XC)
Calculation
Reactance depends upon a circuit's inductance (L) or
capacitance (C) and the frequency (f) of the supply voltage.
It is calculated as follows:
(Inductive reactance) XL = 2πfL
(Capacitive reactance) XC = 1/(2πfC)
Reactance is measured in ohms (Ω).

Impedance in Electrical Circuits
Definition
Impedance (Z) is the total opposition to the flow of current
and consists of a circuit's resistance and reactance.
Calculation
For circuits with resistance and inductive reactance:
Z = √(R² + XL²)
For circuits with resistance and capacitive reactance:
Z = √(R² + XC²)
For circuits with resistance, inductive reactance, and
capacitive reactance:
Z = √(R² + (XL - XC)²)
Impedance is measured in ohms (Ω).

Power in AC Circuits
Phase Angle and Power Factor
The angle between the voltage and current sine curves is
measurable. This angle is called the phase angle (φ, Greek
letter phi).
The cosine of this angle is the power factor of the circuit. A
circuit's power factor varies between 0 (corresponding to a
phase angle of 90°) and 1 (corresponding to 0°).
Types of Power
•True power (or useful power, or active power) -
measured in watts (W)
•Reactive power - measured in reactive volt amperes (var)
•Apparent power - measured in volt amperes (V·A)

Power Relationships in AC Circuits
Apparent Power
Total power in volt-amperes (VA)
True Power
Useful power in watts (W)
Reactive Power
Power for magnetic/electric fields in var
The relationship between the three forms of power is based on the Pythagorean Theorem: (Apparent power)² = (True power)²
+ (Reactive power)² or Apparent power = √((True power)² + (Reactive power)²)

Power Calculations in AC
Circuits
Apparent Power Calculation
Apparent power = Voltage × Current
Power Factor Consideration
Power factor = cos(φ)
True Power Calculation
True power = Apparent power × Power factor
True power = Voltage × Current × Power factor

Power Factor Importance
Efficiency Considerations
For a given value of true power, the apparent power
increases as the power factor falls. For low values of power
factor, a generator must produce a large amount of
apparent power in order to supply a relatively small amount
of true power.
Optimization Goal
As the apparent power determines the amount of current
that a generator supplies, it is desirable to make the value of
the apparent power as close as possible to the true power.
This can be achieved by ensuring that the circuit's power
factor is as high (as close to 1) as possible.

Capacitance in AC Circuits
What is a Capacitor?
The capacitor consists of two aluminum electrodes (plates) with dielectric
material between them. The non-conducting dielectric prevents electron flow
between the plates but allows storage of an electrical charge.
The DC resistance of a capacitor is infinite (∞).
Capacitors store electrical energy in an electric field between their plates.
They are essential components in many AC circuits, particularly in motor
applications.

Types of Capacitors for Gas Technicians
Starting Capacitors
The starting capacitor
consists of two aluminum
plates separated by a
dielectric of chemically
treated paper, impregnated
with non-conducting
electrolyte. Starting
capacitors are available
with capacitance ratings
from 75 to 600 microfarads
(μF) and with voltage
ratings of 110 V to 330 V.
Running Capacitors
Running capacitors stay in
the motor circuit for the
entire cycle of operation.
For this reason, they must
have some means of
dissipating the resulting
heat. They do this by means
of an oil-filled case. The oil-
filled running capacitor is
larger than the starting
capacitor, but its capacity is
smaller.

Starting Capacitors
Physical Characteristics
Starting capacitors have relatively small cases. They are only
used for a short period on each cycle of the motor they
serve. Therefore, they have no need to dissipate heat,
although their capacity is larger than that of running
capacitors.
Technical Specifications
•Capacitance: 75 to 600 microfarads (μF)
•Voltage ratings: 110 V to 330 V
•Construction: Aluminum plates with paper dielectric
•Electrolyte: Non-conducting, chemically treated

Running Capacitors
Physical Characteristics
Running capacitors stay in the motor circuit for the entire
cycle of operation. For this reason, they must have some
means of dissipating the resulting heat. They do this by
means of an oil-filled case.
Comparison to Starting Capacitors
•Larger physical size due to oil-filled case
•Smaller capacitance value
•Designed for continuous operation
•Better heat dissipation capabilities

Capacitors in Parallel
Calculation Method
The capacitance (e.g., μF) of two or more capacitors
connected in parallel is the sum of the individual
capacitances.
For capacitors in parallel:
Ctotal = C1 + C2 + C3 + ...
This diagram shows how capacitors are connected in parallel
and how their total capacitance is calculated.

Capacitors in Series
Calculation Method
For capacitors in series, the total capacitance is calculated
using the reciprocal formula:
1/Ctotal = 1/C1 + 1/C2 + 1/C3 + ...
For two capacitors in series, this simplifies to:
Ctotal = (C1 × C2) / (C1 + C2)
This diagram shows how capacitors are connected in series
and how their total capacitance is calculated.

Capacitor Calculation Example
Series Connection Example
For two capacitors in series with values of 10 μF and 15 μF:
Ctotal = (10 μF × 15 μF) / (10 μF + 15 μF)
Ctotal = 150 μF / 25 μF
Ctotal = 6 μF
Parallel Connection Example
For two capacitors in parallel with values of 10 μF and 15 μF:
Ctotal = 10 μF + 15 μF
Ctotal = 25 μF

Practical Applications of DC
Electronic Devices
Smartphones, tablets, computers, and other personal electronics typically operate on
DC power, often supplied by batteries or AC adapters that convert AC to DC.
Automotive Systems
Vehicle electrical systems use DC power from the battery and alternator to operate
lights, ignition systems, and other electrical components.
Small Appliances
Many portable appliances and tools use DC power from batteries or power adapters.
Solar Power Systems
Solar panels generate DC electricity which can be used directly or converted to AC for
home use.

Homes are supplied with AC power for lighting, appliances, and other
electrical needs.
Industrial Motors
Most industrial machinery uses AC motors due to their efficiency and power.
Power Transmission
Electrical grids transmit power over long distances using high-voltage AC.
HVAC Systems
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems typically use AC power for
their motors and controls.

Electrical Safety for Gas
Technicians
Always Verify Power is Off
Use a properly rated multimeter to confirm power is disconnected before
working on any electrical component.
Use Proper Personal Protective Equipment
Wear insulated gloves and use insulated tools when working with electrical
components.
Know Your Limits
Only perform electrical work you are trained and qualified to do. Refer complex
issues to licensed electricians.
Respect Electrical Hazards
Both AC and DC can be dangerous. Never underestimate the potential for
electrical shock or arc flash.

Troubleshooting Capacitor Issues
Identify Symptoms
Motor fails to start, hums, runs
slowly, or overheats. These can
all be signs of capacitor
problems.
Visual Inspection
Look for bulging, leaking, or
other physical damage to the
capacitor. A damaged
capacitor must be replaced.
Test the Capacitor
Use a capacitor tester or
multimeter with capacitance
function to check if the
capacitor is within its rated
value range.
Replace if Necessary
Always replace with a
capacitor of the same type,
voltage rating, and
capacitance value.

Measuring AC Voltage and Current
Digital Multimeters
Modern digital multimeters can measure both AC and DC
voltage and current. When measuring AC, the meter
typically displays the RMS value.
Always ensure the meter is set to the correct function (AC or
DC) and an appropriate range before taking measurements.
Safety Precautions
•Use meters rated for the voltage being measured
•Use proper test leads with adequate insulation
•Keep hands behind protective barriers on test probes
•Avoid contact with conductive surfaces while testing

Electrical Diagrams for Gas Appliances
Reading Electrical Schematics
Gas technicians must be able to interpret electrical diagrams to
troubleshoot and repair gas appliances with electrical
components.
Common symbols include:
•Switches and relays
•Capacitors
•Motors
•Transformers
•Thermostats and sensors
Electrical diagrams show the connections between components
and help technicians understand how the electrical system
functions.

Motor Types in Gas Appliances
Shaded Pole Motors
Simple, low-starting torque motors often used in fans and blowers. They have no capacitor and are the least expensive type of motor.
Permanent Split Capacitor (PSC) Motors
Use a running capacitor to create phase shift. More efficient than shaded pole motors and commonly used in furnace blowers and condenser fans.
Capacitor Start Motors
Use a starting capacitor to provide high starting torque. The capacitor is disconnected once the motor reaches about 75% of rated speed.

Transformers in Gas Appliances
Function and Purpose
Transformers in gas appliances typically step down the
supply voltage (120V or 240V AC) to lower voltages needed
for control circuits (24V AC is common).
They work on the principle of electromagnetic induction
between coils of wire.
Common Applications
•Powering electronic control boards
•Operating gas valves
•Supplying voltage to ignition systems
•Powering thermostats and other low-voltage controls

Ignition Systems in Gas Appliances
Standing Pilot Systems
Traditional system with a continuously burning pilot flame. Uses a thermocouple to generate a small DC voltage (25-30 millivolts) that keeps the gas valve open.
Intermittent Pilot Ignition
Uses AC voltage to create a spark that lights a pilot only when heat is called for. More efficient than standing pilot systems.
Direct Spark Ignition
Creates a high-voltage spark directly at the main burner without using a pilot. Requires AC power and electronic control circuits.

Thermocouples and Thermopiles
Thermocouple Operation
A thermocouple consists of two dissimilar metals joined
together. When heated by a pilot flame, it generates a small
DC voltage (typically 25-30 millivolts).
This voltage energizes an electromagnet in the gas valve,
keeping it open as long as the pilot is lit. If the pilot goes out,
the voltage drops and the valve closes for safety.
Thermopile Operation
A thermopile is essentially multiple thermocouples
connected in series to generate a higher voltage (around
250-750 millivolts DC).
This higher voltage can operate more complex gas valves
and sometimes power additional controls without requiring
external electricity.

Electronic Control Boards
Function in Gas Appliances
Modern gas appliances often use electronic control boards
that manage all aspects of operation, including:
•Ignition sequence timing
•Safety monitoring
•Temperature control
•Fan and motor operation
•Diagnostic functions
Power Requirements
Control boards typically operate on low-voltage AC (24V)
supplied by a transformer, but may convert this to DC
internally for microprocessor operation.
Some boards include capacitors for filtering and stabilizing
the power supply.

Electrical Testing Equipment
Gas technicians use various electrical testing equipment to diagnose problems in gas appliances. Digital multimeters can measure voltage, current,
resistance, and sometimes capacitance. Specialized tools like microamp meters measure flame sensing current, while capacitor testers verify proper
capacitor operation.

Electrical Troubleshooting Process
Gather Information
Collect symptoms, history, and any error codes from the appliance
Visual Inspection
Look for obvious issues like damaged wires, burnt components, or loose connections
Check Power Supply
Verify proper voltage is reaching the appliance and its components
Component Testing
Test individual components like capacitors, motors, switches, and sensors
Repair or Replace
Fix the identified issues and verify proper operation

Electrical Safety Devices
Circuit Breakers
Protect against overcurrent conditions
by automatically interrupting the circuit
when current exceeds the rated value.
They can be reset after tripping.
Ground Fault Circuit
Interrupters (GFCIs)
Detect imbalances in current flow that
could indicate a ground fault. They
quickly disconnect power to prevent
electrical shock hazards.
Fuses
One-time protection devices that
contain a metal strip that melts when
current exceeds the rated value. They
must be replaced after blowing.

Electrical Grounding
Purpose of Grounding
Electrical grounding serves several important safety
functions:
•Provides a path for fault current to safely return to the
source
•Helps trip circuit breakers quickly during a fault
•Prevents metal parts of appliances from becoming
energized
•Protects people from electrical shock
Grounding in Gas Appliances
Gas appliances with electrical components must be properly
grounded according to local electrical codes and
manufacturer specifications.
Improper grounding can lead to electrical shock hazards,
erratic operation, and damage to electronic components.

Electrical Codes and Standards
National Electrical Code (NEC)
Sets the foundation for electrical safety in residential, commercial, and industrial
installations.
Canadian Electrical Code (CEC)
The Canadian standard for safe electrical installations, published by the Canadian
Standards Association.
Local Codes
Many jurisdictions have additional requirements that supplement national codes.
Manufacturer Specifications
Equipment must be installed according to manufacturer instructions, which may
have specific electrical requirements.

Power Quality Issues

Temporary decreases or increases in voltage that can affect equipment
operation.
Harmonics
Distortions in the voltage or current waveform that can cause
overheating and equipment malfunction.
Power Interruptions
Complete loss of power that can disrupt operation and potentially
damage equipment during restart.
Transients/Surges
Brief, high-voltage spikes that can damage electronic components in
gas appliances.

Energy Efficiency in Electrical Systems
Motor Efficiency
Modern high-efficiency motors use less electricity to
produce the same mechanical output. They typically have:
•Better materials and design
•Lower resistance windings
•Improved bearings
•Better cooling
Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs)
VFDs allow motors to operate at variable speeds rather than
just on/off, which can significantly reduce energy
consumption in applications with varying load requirements.
They work by converting fixed-frequency AC power to
variable-frequency output, allowing precise control of
motor speed and torque.

components like resistors, capacitors, inductors, transformers, motors, switches, grounds, and fuses. Understanding these symbols is essential for properly
interpreting diagrams when troubleshooting gas appliances with electrical components.

Introduction to Transformers
Definition
A transformer is an electrical device that transfers energy
between two or more circuits through electromagnetic
induction and commonly helps increase or decrease the
voltages of alternating current in electric power
applications.
Types
While most large-current transformers are three-phase,
this presentation focuses on single-phase transformers for
simplicity. The principle is the same for three phase, except
that there are three sets of windings instead of just one.

Single-Phase Transformer
Components
Primary Winding
The winding that
receives the input
voltage
Secondary
Winding
The winding that
delivers the output
voltage
Core
Usually made of iron
to concentrate the
magnetic field

Single-Phase Transformer
Operation
Figure 6-1 shows a transformer core with a primary winding and a
secondary winding. The windings are actually wound around each other
on a real transformer. However, for simplicity of understanding, the
figure shows two separate windings. The current is supplied to the
primary winding and the output is from the secondary winding. In this
example, there are 100 turns (Np= 100) in the primary and 1000 turns (Ns
= 1000) in the secondary.

Electromagnetic Induction in
Transformers
Current Flow
When the primary winding of this transformer takes an alternating
voltage, a current flows
Magnetic Field Generation
A magnetic field develops around the winding and fluctuates at 60
Hz
Flux Lines
The flux lines cut through the secondary winding
Voltage Induction
A voltage is induced into the secondary winding through
electromagnetic induction

Step-Up Transformers
Definition
A step-up transformer has more turns in the secondary
winding than in the primary winding, resulting in a higher
output voltage than input voltage.
Example
In Figure 6-1, the secondary coil has 1000 turns and the
primary has 100 turns. This means that the secondary
voltage is 10 times the primary voltage (1000 ÷ 100). Since
the primary voltage is 200 V, then the secondary voltage will
be 2000 V (200 x 10).

Step-Down Transformers
Definition
A step-down transformer has fewer turns in the secondary
winding than in the primary winding, resulting in a lower
output voltage than input voltage.
Operation
In a step-down transformer, the operation is exactly the
same as a step-up transformer. However, the secondary
winding has fewer turns than the primary winding so the
secondary voltage is less than the primary voltage. Also, the
secondary current is greater than the primary current.

Transformer Output Calculation
Voltage Ratio Formula
You can calculate the secondary (output) voltage of a
transformer by multiplying the primary voltage by the
ratio of turns in the secondary to primary coils.
Vs/Vp = Ns/Np
Variables
Vs = secondary voltage
Vp = primary voltage
Ns = turns in secondary coil
Np = turns in primary coil

Transformer Current Calculation
Power Conservation
Transformer efficiency is very high, so the output power is
very close to the input power. Since power is a function of
the voltage times the current, you can calculate the
secondary current if you know the primary current.
VpIp = VsIs
Therefore: Is = (Vp/Vs) × Ip
Example
In the example, the primary current is 10 A. Since output
voltage increases by ten times and the power remains the
same, the current must decrease by ten times. The current
in the secondary winding must therefore be 1 A.

Wire Size in Transformers
Step-Up
Transformers
Since the secondary
current is lower than the
primary current in a step-
up transformer, the size of
the conductor in the
secondary winding can be
smaller
Winding Design
You can make the winding
with the most turns of
smaller-diameter wire
Step-Down Transformers
In step-down transformers, the secondary current is greater than
the primary current, requiring larger wire for the secondary
winding

Self-Regulation in Transformers
Load Change
As the current flow through the
secondary winding changes
Primary Current Adjustment
The primary current also changes
automatically
Power Balance
Input and output power remain
balanced
Circuit Protection
If opening a switch or circuit breaker
stops the secondary current, the
primary current flow also stops

Transformer with Open
Secondary Circuit
In the upper portion of Figure 6-2 is a simple coil of conductor that wraps
around a steel core. An ac voltage applied to the coil normally results in a
flow of current through the wire. In fact, since there are no resistors in
this circuit, a large current flow results. This is the case in a de circuit. But
in a properly designed alternating current circuit, very little current will
flow.

Back EMF in Transformers
Alternating Current
The alternating current causes a magnetic field to build up and
collapse around the coils 120 times per second
Flux Lines
As the lines of flux pass through the primary winding, they induce a
voltage in that winding
Induced Voltage
This induced voltage is the opposite of applied voltage and acts to
limit applied voltage
Voltage Cancellation
The two voltages (applied and induced) very nearly cancel each
other out, so only a very small current flows

Back EMF Example
Example
If a 60 Hz supply is connected to the coil with a voltage of
220 V, the fluctuating magnetic field induces a voltage in the
winding that is equal to the applied voltage, but in the
opposite direction.
Terminology
The induced voltage is often what you call back emf.
Another term for source voltage is electromotive force
(emf). Back emf plays an important part in limiting the
current flow through electric machines.

Transformer with Open Secondary Circuit
The bottom part of Figure 6-2 shows a simple transformer
with the secondary circuit open at the switch. Since no
current flows through this circuit, it has no effect on the
transformer, which operates as though there were only one
coil.
Thus, when the secondary circuit is open, the primary
current flow decreases to a very small value. Although there
is no current flow in the secondary circuit, the field produced
by the very small primary current maintains the terminal
voltage of the transformer's secondary winding's terminal
voltage.

Transformer Under Load
Switch Closure
When the switch is closed and a small load is placed across the
secondary circuit, enough current flows to supply this load
Secondary Magnetic Field
This current flow in the secondary winding now produces a
magnetic field of its own
Field Opposition
The magnetic field that the secondary winding current
produced is opposite the magnetic field that the primary
winding current produced
Primary Field Reduction
Because the secondary field opposes the primary field, the
primary field is reduced

Back EMF and Current Flow
Reduced Primary Field
The primary field is reduced due to the opposing secondary field
Reduced Back EMF
This is the magnetic field that produced the back emf. Since the
primary field is reduced, the back emf is reduced in the primary
winding
Increased Primary Current
The reduction in the back emf causes more current to flow in the
primary winding
Self-Regulation
Any increase in the secondary current flow results in a proportional
increase in primary current flow

Load Increase Effects
Secondary Load Increases
As the secondary load increases
Secondary Current Increases
The current flow through the
secondary winding increases
Secondary Field Strengthens
This increase in current strengthens
the secondary field
3
Primary Field Weakens
The stronger secondary field further
weakens the primary field
Primary Current Increases
This further reduces back emf and
increases primary current flow

Autotransformers
Definition
An autotransformer differs from the standard transformer in
that it consists of a single coil, arranged as shown in Figure
6-3.
An autotransformer is a power transformer with one
continuous winding, part of which serves as the primary
winding and all of which serves as the secondary winding, or
vice versa. Secondary voltages are supplied across any pair
of a series of connections (taps).

Autotransformer Characteristics
No Electrical Isolation
An important thing to note is
that there is no electrical
isolation between the primary
and secondary of an
autotransformer
Economic Advantage
For this reason,
autotransformers are more
economical to manufacture than
other types
Safety Concern
For the same reason, they are
also more vulnerable to
catastrophic failure

Common Electrical
Measuring Instruments
Voltmeter
Used to measure voltage
Ammeter
Used to measure current
Ohmmeter
Used to measure resistance and continuity

Multimeters: The All-in-One Solution
The functions of each individual instrument can be combined into a single versatile instrument called multimeter. Multimeters
are more commonly used in the field and are often known by other names such as volt-ohm-milliammeter (VOM) and digital
multimeter (DMM). A multimeter saves having to purchase numerous individual meters.

Analogue vs Digital Multimeters
Analogue Meters
Consist of a needle-type pointer that moves across a fixed scale
Somewhat delicate and requires placement on a horizontal surface to retain accuracy
Digital Meters
Display using liquid-crystal or light-emitting diodes (LED)
Often easier to read than analogue meters
Will retain their accuracy regardless of positioning

Digital Multimeter
Variations
Digital multimeters can vary greatly in their operation and functions.
Most multimeters can measure both alternating current (ac) and direct
current (dc), whereas some voltmeters and ammeters can measure only
one type of current. Always refer to the instrument's operating
instruction booklet before using it to confirm its safe and proper use.

Measuring Voltage
Connect in Parallel
To measure voltage, you must connect a
voltmeter across the two points in the
circuit where the voltage appears, or in
other words, in parallel with the part of the
circuit under test.
Minimal Circuit Impact
It is very important that the addition of the
voltmeter into a circuit has very little
effect on the conditions normally existing
in the circuit.
High Internal Resistance
A voltmeter must have a very high internal
resistance, so that operating the
instrument will draw very little current
from that circuit.

Voltmeter Resistance Requirements
Maximum Accuracy
For maximum accuracy, a
voltmeter's internal resistance
should be many times higher
than any resistance encountered
in the circuit under test.
Analogue Voltmeters
Analogue voltmeters have
internal resistances in the
thousands of ohms.
Digital Voltmeters
Digital instruments often have
internal resistances in the
millions of ohms.

Measuring Current
Break the Circuit
In order to measure current, break
down the circuit at the point where you
will measure the current.
Insert in Series
Insert the ammeter in series with the
circuit under test.
Safety First
Before breaking any circuit to insert an
ammeter, it is first necessary to switch
the circuit off to avoid danger.

Ammeter Characteristics
Low Internal Resistance
The internal resistance of the ammeter is very low, normally a fraction of an
ohm.
Avoid Incorrect Connections
Due to the ammeter's low internal resistance, you must avoid connecting it
across a load under test or the supply voltage itself.
Potential Damage
Incorrect connection would cause high current to flow through the ammeter,
seriously damaging the instrument and possibly harming the operator.
Protection Features
Some ammeters come with a fuse or circuit-breaker for protecting the
instrument, but you should never assume that this is adequate protection.

Understanding Ohm's Law
Ohm's law tells us that, with a fixed value of voltage across a circuit, the value of current flowing depends upon the resistance of that circuit:
Higher Resistance
The higher the resistance, the lower the current flow.
Lower Resistance
The lower the resistance, the higher the current flow.
In other words, the value of the current flowing through a circuit is a guide to the resistance of that circuit. This is the principle of operation of the ohmmeter.

How an Ohmmeter Works
Connect Test Leads
The test-leads are connected to the instrument's terminals and are
first short-circuited together.
Adjust Rheostat
Adjustment of rheostat occurs until the instrument registers full-scale
deflection—this corresponds to zero ohms.
Test Circuit
Now, the test-leads are connected to the circuit or component under
test.
Read Measurement
The resulting current through the ohmmeter will be lower than it was
before, because of the added resistance, and the instrument's pointer
will register somewhat less than full-scale deflection.

Analogue Ohmmeter Scale
Right to Left Reading
Unlike the voltmeter and the ammeter, the most noticeable
thing about an analogue ohmmeter's scale is that you read it
from right to left.
Non-Linear Scale
The scale is non-linear. This means that the graduations
that represent the higher values of resistance (to the left
side of the scale) are very close together, while those
representing lower values (to the right side of the scale)
have wider spacings.

Zero Ohms Adjustment
Perform Before Use
Using the built-in rheostat to adjust for
full-scale deflection is what you call zero
ohms adjustment. You must perform it
before using the ohmmeter to measure
resistance.
Battery Compensation
This compensates for any variation in the
voltage of the instrument's battery.
Battery Check
If you cannot achieve zero ohms
adjustment, it means the battery is too
weak and needs replacement.

Ohmmeter Operating Precautions
Do
•Always be aware of inadvertently measuring the
resistance of other components that are connected in
parallel with the component under test.
•You may have to physically remove the component from
the circuit before performing the test.
•Always switch an ohmmeter off when measurements are
completed.
Do Not/Never
•Never connect an ohmmeter across a live load or the
supply voltage itself.
•This would cause high current to flow through the
ammeter, seriously damaging the instrument and
possibly harming the operator!
•Never leave test-leads shorted together when the
instrument is off, as the instrument's battery will very
quickly discharge.

Checking Continuity
Technicians/fitters very often use ohmmeters to check for continuity—to
confirm, for example, that a circuit, or component, is not open-circuited.
When checking continuity, the actual resistance of the circuit or
component is unimportant—a simple deflection of the pointer confirms
continuity.

Variable Range Instruments
Extended Versatility
In order to extend their
versatility, most electrical
measuring instruments have
several ranges.
Voltmeter Example
For example, you may adjust a
voltmeter to read: 0 to 5 V, 0
to 10 V, 0 to 25 V, and 0 to 100
V.
Multiple Scales
An analogue voltmeter may have four separate scales or only one
scale (say, 0 to 5 V), in which case you must multiply its reading by
factors of x2, x5, or x20, according to the selected range.

Scale Selection Methods
Analogue Instruments
The method for selecting the range on such an instrument varies from manufacturer to
manufacturer, with the most common being a rotary knob that aligns with ranges engraved
onto the case.
Digital Instruments
Modern digital instruments often select the appropriate range automatically.

Range Selection Best Practices
Start High
If you are unsure of the value of voltage or current that you are about to
measure, always start with the highest range and work down until you
achieve the greatest readable deflection of the pointer.
Estimate First
Always estimate the likely value of voltage or current before
performing the test, just in case it is beyond even the highest range of
the instrument.
Maximize Accuracy
For maximum accuracy with analogue instruments, always select
the range that gives the greatest readable deflection because all
instruments are calibrated to give maximum accuracy at full-scale
deflection.

Understanding Instrument
Accuracy
For example, suppose a 100 V voltmeter is manufactured to an accuracy
of ±5%. This accuracy applies to the instrument's full-scale deflection. In
other words, it is accurate to ±5 V at its 100 V reading. So, when it
indicates 100 V, the actual voltage could be anywhere between 95 V and
105 V. However, when the same instrument indicates, say, only 10 V, it is
still accurate to ±5 V, so the actual voltage could range from 5 V to 15 V!

Ohmmeter Range
Adjustment
Adjust for Zero Ohms
In the case of an ohmmeter,
you must adjust the
instrument for zero ohms
each time its range is
changed.
Prepare Before
Measurement
You must also adjust for
zero ohms before you use
the ohmmeter to take a
measurement.
Verify Battery Condition
If zero adjustment cannot be achieved, check and replace the
battery if necessary.

Digital Multimeter (DMM) Overview
As discussed in Unit 2 Fasteners, Tools and Testing Instruments, Chapter 6. Electrical Testing Instruments, a digital
multimeter has all the functions of an analogue multimeter plus advanced features. The primary difference to the
technician/fitter is the way the user reads the data. DMMs have extended features depending on the make and model.

Field Service Technician's Multimeter
The following illustrations from a user's manual give typical examples of taking measurements with a common digital
multimeter.

Measuring Resistance Safely
Disconnect
Power
To avoid electric
shock, injury, or
damage to the meter,
disconnect circuit
power before testing.
Discharge
Capacitors
Discharge all high-
voltage capacitors
before testing
resistance, continuity,
diodes, or
capacitance.
Follow
Procedures
Always follow proper
safety procedures
when working with
electrical circuits.

Testing for Continuity
Note: The continuity function works best as a fast, convenient method to
check for opens and shorts. For maximum accuracy in making resistance
measurements, use the meter's resistance (Ω) function.

Measuring AC and DC Voltage
Using Auto Volts Selection
With the function switch in the A~~~-V position, the meter
automatically selects a dc or ac voltage measurement based
on the input applied between the V or + and COM jacks.
This function also sets the meter's input impedance to
approximately 3kΩ to reduce the possibility of false readings
due to ghost voltages.

Measuring AC and DC
Millivolts
With the function switch in the m~V position, the meter measures ac plus
dc millivolts. Press D to switch the meter to dc millivolts.

Measuring AC or DC Current
Safety Warnings
To avoid personal injury or
damage to the meter:
•Never attempt to make an
in-circuit current
measurement when the
open-circuit potential to
earth is >600V.
•Check the meter's fuse
before testing.
Proper Setup
Use the proper terminals,
switch position, and range for
your measurement.
Avoid Parallel Connections
Never place the probes in parallel with a circuit or component when the
leads are plugged into the A (amps) terminals.

Current Measurement
Procedure
Power Off
Turn circuit power off before beginning.
Break Circuit
Break the circuit at the point where you want to measure current.
Insert Meter
Insert the meter in series with the circuit.
Power On
Turn circuit power on to take the measurement.

Measuring Current Above 10
Amps
The millivolt and voltage function of the meter can be used with an
optional mV/A output current probe to measure currents that exceed
the rating of the meter. Make sure the meter has the correct function
selected, ac or dc, for your current probe. Refer to a catalog or contact a
representative for compatible current clamps.

Measuring Capacitance
Digital multimeters can also measure capacitance, which is the ability of a
component to store an electrical charge. This is useful when testing
capacitors in electrical circuits.

Multimeter Safety Guidelines
Inspect Before Use
Always inspect the multimeter, test leads, and accessories for damage before use.
Do not use if damage is visible.
Verify Operation
Test the meter on a known live circuit to verify it's working properly before taking
measurements.
Use Proper Category Rating
Ensure your meter has the appropriate category rating (CAT) for the environment
you're working in.
Follow Manufacturer Instructions
Always read and follow the specific instructions provided by the manufacturer for
your model.

Proper Hand Positioning
Correct Technique
When using a multimeter, keep your fingers behind the
finger guards on the test probes.
This helps prevent accidental contact with live circuits and
reduces the risk of electrical shock.

measure the resistance of the
solenoid coil. Compare with
manufacturer specifications to
determine if the solenoid is
functioning properly.

Inspect Wiring
Test for continuity in all wiring connections

Measuring Thermocouple Output
Thermocouples are safety devices used in gas appliances to verify the presence of a
pilot flame. A properly functioning thermocouple should generate a small DC voltage
(typically 25-30 millivolts) when heated by the pilot flame.
Set Multimeter
Set the multimeter to DC millivolts (mV) range.
Connect Probes
Connect the negative probe to the thermocouple sheath and the positive
probe to the copper lead.
Heat Thermocouple
With the pilot lit and heating the thermocouple, take the reading.
Interpret Results
A reading below 20mV typically indicates a failing thermocouple that
should be replaced.

Testing Pressure Switches
Function
Pressure switches in gas appliances verify proper venting
and air flow before allowing gas valve operation.
They are normally open (NO) switches that close when
proper pressure differential is detected.
Testing Method
Set multimeter to continuity or resistance mode.
Connect probes to the pressure switch terminals.
With the system running and proper pressure applied, the
switch should show continuity (closed circuit).
Without proper pressure, the switch should show no
continuity (open circuit).

Checking Fan Motor Circuits
Verify Power Supply
Measure voltage at the motor terminals to confirm proper supply
voltage.
Test Motor Windings
Measure resistance of motor windings to check for opens or shorts.
Check Capacitor

Measuring Flame Rectification
Current
Modern gas appliances often use flame rectification to verify flame presence. This
system produces a small DC current (typically 2-10 microamps) when a flame is present.
Set Multimeter
Set the multimeter to DC microamps (μA) range.
Break Circuit
Disconnect one wire from the flame sensor and connect the multimeter in
series.
Operate System
Start the appliance and allow it to ignite.
Read Current
A stable flame should produce a reading of at least 2 microamps. Lower
readings indicate a problem with the flame sensor or grounding.

Testing Limit Switches
Function
Limit switches are safety devices that open when temperature exceeds safe levels,
shutting down the heating system.
Normal Operation
Under normal temperature conditions, limit switches should show continuity
(closed circuit).
Testing Method
Set multimeter to continuity or resistance mode and connect probes to the switch
terminals. A reading of near zero ohms indicates a properly functioning switch.
Troubleshooting
If a limit switch shows no continuity at normal temperatures, it may be defective or
may have tripped due to overheating conditions that need to be addressed.

Checking Transformer Output
Primary Side
Set multimeter to AC voltage and measure across the primary terminals of
the transformer. This should match the input voltage (typically 120V or
240V).
Secondary Side
Set multimeter to AC voltage and measure across the secondary terminals.
This should match the expected output voltage (typically 24V for control
circuits in gas appliances).

Verifying Proper Grounding
Importance
Proper grounding is essential for both safety and correct operation of
electronic control systems in gas appliances.
Testing Method
Set multimeter to continuity or resistance mode and check for continuity
between the ground terminal and the appliance chassis.
Voltage Check
Set multimeter to AC voltage and measure between the neutral wire and
ground. A properly grounded system should show very low voltage (less than
2V).
Resistance Verification
The resistance between the ground terminal and chassis should be very low
(less than 1 ohm).

Measuring Voltage Drop
Voltage drop testing can help identify poor connections or excessive
resistance in circuits that may cause operational issues.
Set Multimeter
Set the multimeter to DC voltage for DC circuits or AC voltage for AC
circuits.
Connect Probes
Connect the probes across the component or wire section being
tested.
Operate Circuit
Ensure the circuit is operating and current is flowing.
Interpret Results
A significant voltage drop across a connection or wire indicates
excessive resistance that should be addressed.

Testing Relay Circuits
Coil Testing
Set multimeter to resistance mode and measure across the
relay coil terminals. The reading should match the
manufacturer's specifications (typically a few hundred
ohms).
Alternatively, set to DC voltage and verify the coil is
receiving the correct voltage when activated.
Contact Testing
Set multimeter to continuity mode and check the relay
contacts in both energized and de-energized states:
•Normally open (NO) contacts should show no continuity
when de-energized and continuity when energized
•Normally closed (NC) contacts should show continuity
when de-energized and no continuity when energized

Checking Thermistor Sensors
Thermistors are temperature sensors used in modern gas appliances to monitor various
temperatures. Most are negative temperature coefficient (NTC) type, meaning their
resistance decreases as temperature increases.
Resistance Testing
Set multimeter to resistance mode
and measure across the thermistor
terminals. Compare the reading to the
manufacturer's
temperature/resistance chart.
Temperature Correlation
Measure the actual temperature at
the sensor location and verify the
resistance reading corresponds to
that temperature according to
specifications.
Circuit Verification

receiving the sensor signal.

Diagnosing Intermittent Issues
Monitor Over Time
Use a multimeter with min/max recording capability to capture fluctuations
Check Under Vibration
Test connections while gently flexing wires to identify loose connections
Test at Different Temperatures
Monitor circuit behavior as components heat up during operation
Verify Under Load
Test circuit performance when the system is under full operational load

Measuring Insulation Resistance
For testing high-resistance insulation in motors and wiring, a specialized insulation tester
(megohmmeter) is often required, as standard multimeters cannot measure very high
resistance values accurately.
Safety First
Always disconnect power and discharge capacitors before testing insulation
resistance.
Specialized Equipment
Use a proper insulation resistance tester (megohmmeter) for this test.
Testing Method
Connect one lead to the conductor and the other to ground, then apply the test
voltage and read the resistance value.
Interpretation
Good insulation typically shows resistance in the megohm range. Low readings
indicate insulation breakdown.

Testing Capacitors
Discharge First
Always discharge capacitors before testing by shorting the
terminals with an insulated resistor.
Set Multimeter
Set the multimeter to capacitance mode if available.
Connect Probes
Connect the probes to the capacitor terminals, observing
polarity for polarized capacitors.
Read Value
Compare the measured value to the rated capacitance. It
should be within the tolerance specified (typically ±10%).

Checking for Voltage Leakage
Voltage leakage can occur when insulation breaks down or when moisture creates conductive paths between circuits.
Testing Method
Set multimeter to the highest DC or AC voltage range.
Connect one probe to the suspected leakage source and the
other to ground or another circuit.
Any significant voltage reading indicates leakage that
should be addressed.
Common Causes
•Damaged wire insulation
•Moisture or corrosion on circuit boards
•Failed component insulation
•Improper grounding
