Operating steam pressure switches on steam boilers are what you call pressuretrols. As steam pressure in the boiler rises and reaches the
set point of the pressuretrol, the switch contacts open and de-energize the power to the main gas valve. The contacts remain open until the
steam pressure drops and reaches the low point setting. The high and low set points on the operating pressuretrols are adjustable, as are
the differentials.

Combination Pressure-Temperature
Relief Valve: Installation
Requirements
Proper Positioning
The sensing stem must extend into the water within the top six inches of the tank
Discharge Piping
Must be piped without restrictions or reductions in diameter to an air gap as per local
Building Codes
Material Selection
Discharge pipe must be of a material suitable of withstanding the potential discharge
temperatures
Replacement
Whenever a water heater is replaced, you should install a new valve and discard the old
valve

Low Water Cut-Off Switch: Float Type
The float type low water cut-off switch is a normally open
switch that the float on top of the water holds close. If the
water level falls below a predetermined point, the float
mechanism lowers and breaks the electrical contact.
This type of low water cut-off is commonly used in larger
boiler systems and provides a mechanical means of
detecting low water conditions without relying on electronic
sensors.
The float mechanism must be regularly maintained and
inspected to ensure proper operation, as sediment or scale
can affect its movement.
Figure 4-12 Float-type low water cut-off switch

Low Water Cut-Off Switch: Probe Type
The probe type low water cut-off switch is a normally open
switch. It has an electronic circuitry that uses boiler water to
conduct current between the terminals on the end of the
probe.
If the water falls below the level of the probe, the electronic
circuit between the terminals is broken. In response to no
circuit, the low water cut-off switch opens, cutting off power
to the main gas valve.
Probe-type systems are often preferred in modern
installations due to their reliability and lack of moving parts
that can fail due to scale or sediment buildup.
Figure 4-13 Probe-type low water cut-off switch (top view)

Flow Switch: Critical Safety Function
Prevent Damage
Protects boiler from operating without adequate water flow
Detect Water Movement
Senses circulation in the piping system
Verify Pump Operation
Confirms pumps are functioning properly
Control Burner
Prevents firing without proper circulation
Flow switches are especially important for boilers with small water capacities, as their water may turn to steam if the flow of water is
inadequate, potentially causing damage to the system.

Air Flow Switch Applications
Sail Switch
Used to detect the physical movement
of air in ducts and ventilation systems.
The "sail" portion moves when air flows
past it, activating the switch
mechanism.
Pressure Differential Switch
Used in high-efficiency furnaces to
verify proper combustion air flow and
venting. It measures the pressure
difference created by the draft inducer
motor.
Blocked Vent Safety
Air flow switches can detect blocked
vents, faulty heat exchangers, or
blocked drain tubes, shutting down
furnace operation to prevent dangerous
conditions.

Flame Roll-Out: Causes and
Hazards
Definition
Flame roll-out occurs when the
burner flame escapes from the
combustion chamber, potentially
causing fire or carbon monoxide
hazards.
Common Causes
•Failure to vent flue products
properly
•Heat exchanger cracks or failures
•Blocked or restricted heat
exchangers
•Excessive gas pressure
•Improper burner alignment
Safety Response
The flame roll-out switch is a high temperature limit switch that opens and de-
energizes the gas valve if it senses flame roll-out. This is a manually reset switch
to ensure the issue is addressed before operation resumes.

Blocked Vent Shut-Off System: Importance
Critical Safety Function
When furnaces have draft hoods, you may equip them with a shut-off system that
automatically cuts out the main burner when the vent is totally blocked.
These systems are temperature sensing, manual reset switches wired in series to the gas
valve function. They detect when flue gases are not properly venting and shut down the
system to prevent carbon monoxide from entering the living space.
Furnace certification standards specify test methods for these systems to ensure they
function properly in emergency situations.
These shut-off systems are commonly—and incorrectly—referred to as spill switches.
The proper terminology is important for technicians to understand the exact function
and purpose of these safety devices.

Electronic Control Module: Diagnostic Capabilities
Continuous Monitoring
The integrated circuits continuously monitor the furnace's
operation and the operation of the integrated control
module itself.
Failure Codes
If a failure occurs, LEDs can indicate a failure code. The
Owner's Manual and the furnace door provide the codes.
Self-Diagnostics
These integrated controllers can perform self-diagnostics
to identify specific system issues.
Troubleshooting Aid
Diagnostic capabilities help technicians quickly identify
and resolve problems.

High Efficiency Furnaces and Control Modules
You always find integrated electronic controllers on higher efficiency furnaces that rely on many sophisticated design
features to reach their high AFUE ratings of over 90%.
These advanced control systems manage complex operations including:
•Variable-speed blower motor control
•Multi-stage or modulating gas valve operation
•Precise timing of ignition sequences
•Monitoring of multiple safety circuits
•Communication with smart thermostats
•Self-diagnostic functions
Modern high-efficiency furnaces require sophisticated electronic control systems to manage their complex operations
and safety features.

Gas Control Valve Components
Regulator
Reduces gas pressure or controls gas
flow
Automatic Shut-Off Valves
One or two valves that automatically
control gas flow
Manual Shut-Off
Allows manual control of gas flow,
may direct flow only to pilot line
3
Pilot Flow Control
Controls flow rate to pilot line, usually
by means of a needle valve
Test Ports

outlet pressure

Gas Control Valve Applications
Constant Pilot Models
Used in older appliances where a small flame burns continuously to ignite the main burner
when needed. These are becoming less common due to energy efficiency concerns.
Intermittent Pilot Models
The pilot only ignites when the appliance calls for heat, then ignites the main burner. This
improves efficiency by eliminating the constant pilot flame.
Direct Ignition Models
No pilot flame is used. Instead, the main burner is ignited directly by a spark or hot surface
igniter when heat is called for, maximizing efficiency.
Modulating Valves
Advanced valves that can vary the gas flow rate to provide precise temperature control and
improved efficiency in high-performance systems.

Wireless Control Advantages
Installation Flexibility
Hard-wired connections between thermostats and furnaces have many limitations that you can overcome
with the application of wireless technology.
Wireless thermostats allow for temperature control in one or more locations during retrofits or new
construction projects without the need to run new wiring through walls.
Most wireless systems include a remote sensor thermostat and sensor along with the option of multiple
remote controllers, providing unprecedented flexibility in system design and operation.
Advanced Features

Manages steam pressure for
manufacturing processes where
specific pressure levels are critical for
production operations.
Residential Steam Heating
Controls lower pressure steam in home
heating systems, typically maintaining
pressures below 2 psig for safe and
efficient operation.

Pressure Relief Valve Sizing and
Selection
Capacity Rating
Must be sized to discharge the full BTU/h capacity of the boiler if needed. Undersized
valves cannot provide adequate protection.
Pressure Setting
Must be set at or below the maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP) of the boiler,
typically with a margin of safety.
Code Compliance
Must meet ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code requirements and be properly certified
and stamped.
Installation Requirements
Must be installed directly to the boiler without intervening valves that could isolate it.
Discharge piping must be properly sized and supported.

Low Water Cut-Off Maintenance
Regular Testing
Low water cut-offs should be tested regularly according to manufacturer
recommendations and local codes, typically weekly for commercial systems.
Cleaning and Inspection
Float-type devices should be disassembled and cleaned periodically to
remove sediment and scale that could affect operation.
Probe Maintenance
Probe-type devices should have their probes inspected and cleaned to
ensure proper electrical conductivity through the water.
Documentation
All testing and maintenance should be documented in the boiler
maintenance log for compliance and safety records.

the switch is closed at normal temperatures.
Reset Verification
If the switch has tripped, press the reset button and verify it resets
properly. If it won't reset, the switch may need replacement.
Root Cause Analysis
If the switch has tripped, thoroughly investigate the cause of flame
roll-out before returning the system to service.

Electronic Control Module Diagnostic Codes
Modern electronic control modules use LED flash patterns or digital displays to indicate specific fault conditions. These
diagnostic codes help technicians quickly identify issues such as flame failures, pressure switch problems, limit switch trips, or
communication errors. The specific codes vary by manufacturer but are typically documented on the furnace door or in the
service manual.

Non-vented and Vented Gas
Appliances
A gas technician/fitter encounters many different gas appliances: some
simple, some complex, some vented, and others non-vented. The
purpose of each is to transfer heat to his unliculpur purpose. This
presentation gives an overview of gas appliances commonly found in the
industry.

Heat Transfer Methods
Energy Transfer Principles
Energy is neither creatable nor destroyable. However, you can
move or transport it from one place to another in various ways.
To understand how a heating or cooling system works, you
must first understand the ways in which heat transfer (energy
movement) occurs.
Heat always flows in one direction, from hot to cold. When
water flows downhill, the steeper the hill, the faster the water
travels. Likewise, in the transfer of heat, the greater the
temperature difference, the faster the heat flows.
Understanding heat transfer methods is essential for gas
technicians to properly install, maintain, and troubleshoot
various gas appliances. Each appliance utilizes one or more of
these methods to deliver heat efficiently.

Conduction Heat Transfer
Definition
Conduction is the flow of heat through a substance by the transfer of heat
energy from particle to particle.
Process
As the particles with greater motion pass some of their energy to slower
particles, heat energy flows from the warmer region to the colder region.
Example
When a rod is heated over an open flame, heat travels by conduction from
the hot end to the cooler end.
Contact Transfer
Conduction heat transfer occurs not only within an object or substance,
but between different substances that are in contact with one another.

Convection Heat Transfer
Definition
Convection is the movement of heat due to the movement
of the heated body. In a convection heating system,
something undergoes heating, then moves to the location to
be heated, where the system gives off the heat.
Fluid Movement
You can most easily do this with fluids (gases and liquids),
because you can easily make them flow from one place to
another to carry the heat. Air is a mixture of several gases
and is therefore considered a fluid. As the air flows or moves,
it carries heat from one place to another.
Natural Convection
When a fluid undergoes heating, it expands and becomes
lighter. If part of a fluid is cooler than another part, gravity
pulls the cooler part earthward, displacing the lighter part of
the fluid so that it rises. Convection movements or currents
are said to move the heat.

Radiation Heat Transfer
Definition
Radiation is the transfer of energy through space, even through a vacuum. Light is a visible form of wave
energy that radiates through space.
Invisible Radiation
Infrared and ultraviolet rays are next to visible light waves on the colour spectrum. However, they have a
different wavelength. You can feel, but not see, their effects.
Visible Radiation
You can also feel and see some heat radiation. The light from the sun is a good example. Another is when you
can see and feel the heat radiation from a red-hot furnace wall or a white-hot piece of metal.
Surface Effects
At the same temperature, a rough dark surface, for example, radiates much more heat than another surface
that is smooth and bright.

Non-vented Gas Appliances Overview
Safety Considerations
Proper ventilation is critical
Heat Transfer Methods
Conduction, convection, radiation
Installation Requirements
Follow CSA B149.1 standards
Gas technicians/fitters commonly install and service various non-vented gas appliances. These appliances don't require
venting to the outside but must be installed in well-ventilated areas. For more detailed information on each of the
characteristics, refer to other chapters covering venting, operation and applications of various burners, pilots and ignition
systems, and controls and safeties.

Barbecue
Heat Transfer
Although construction differs from one to another, gas barbecues cook mostly by
infrared radiation and by convection.
The supply of heat occurs in one of two ways:
•From below the food by briquettes heated by a gas burner
•From above the food by a gas burner of radiant material
Controls and Safety
Ignition: You can light barbecues by hand or with piezo igniters (push-button
quartz igniters).
Burner control: Burner control is typically through a manual control dial.
Safeties: Barbecues do not have safeties included; however, you must place them
in a well-ventilated area as a safety measure.

Range: Cook Top
Heat Transfer

Ignition
You light older models
with a match. Newer
models, on the other
hand, have automatic
ignition (spark
ignition).
Burner Control
On most units, gas flow
through a manual valve
controls the heat.
Some units have a
thermostatically
controlled burner
whereby a device that
contacts the bottom of
the utensil being used
senses the heat.
Safeties
There are no safeties.
Refer to Clauses 7.32 and 7.33 of CSA B149.1 for the general installation requirements for residential
and commercial ranges.

Range: Oven
Heat Transfer
Natural or forced convection
Ignition
You manually light older models with a match. Newer models have a
standing pilot or hot surface ignition.
Burner Control
You turn the burner on and off manually. Controlling the gas flow to
the burner involves the use of a temperature sensor and gas valve as
thermostat.
Safeties
The safeties depend on the type of burner control.

Portable Cook Top and Hot Plate
Installation Requirements
Refer to Clause 7.29 of CSA B149.1 for the general
installation requirements for portable cook tops and hot
plates.
Specifications
•Heat transfer: Predominantly conduction
•Ignition: Manual
•Safeties: There are no safeties
Portable cook tops provide flexibility for cooking in various
locations. They are simple devices with manual controls and
no built-in safety features, making proper installation and
usage critical for safe operation.

Clothes Dryer
Heat Transfer
Forced convection
Ignition
Standing pilot, spark igniter, glow coil, or glow bar
Burner Control
Thermostat sensing element senses exhaust temperatures. This cycles the
burner on and off. Moisture sensor or timer controls the drying period.
Installation
Refer to Clauses 7.4 and 7.5 of CSA B149.1 for the general installation
requirements for residential and commercial clothes dryers.

Clothes Dryer Safety Features
Temperature Limit
Controls
The location of temperature limit
controls is at strategic points in a
dryer. If the controls sense the
main burner compartment
getting too hot, they open the
electric circuit to the main gas
valve.
Motor Safety Circuit
A centrifugal circuit in the motor
causes the main gas valve to
close if the motor is not
operating.
Airflow Monitoring
Large commercial dryers may
have a sail switch located at the
outlet of the blower. If the build-
up of lint results in the reduction
of air flow, the switch will open
and de-energize the main gas
valve.
Gas dryers use a moisture exhaust duct that meets a separate set of code requirements from gas venting and as such is not
considered a vented appliance.

Refrigerator
Installation Requirements
Clause 7.34 of CSA B149.1 contains general installation requirements for refrigerators.
Unvented gas refrigerators have been responsible for numerous CO exposures to occupants. These units are older unvented models
that regulators have subsequently banned for resale. Certified new units both unvented and direct vented are available once again
incorporating CO detectors interlocked to the pilot safety.
Specifications
•Heat transfer: Conduction
•Ignition: Manual or piezo-electric
•Burner control: Thermostat capillary type varies the amount of cooling by varying the amount of gas flow to the burner
•Safeties: High temperature limit switch, interlocked with carbon monoxide (CO) detectors on new models

Water heaters, boilers, pool heaters
Decorative & Space Heating
Fireplaces, infrared heaters, wall
furnaces
Venting Systems
B-vent, direct vent, chimney
Vented gas appliances require proper venting systems to safely remove combustion products to the outdoors. These
appliances come in various types and configurations to meet different heating needs.

Forced Warm-Air Furnace
Overview
Most furnaces in houses and small commercial buildings have a blower that circulates the conditioned air
from a central area of the house, around the heat exchanger, and through the duct work to the rooms.
New gas furnaces in Canada are high-efficiency (89-96%) condensing furnaces. The high-efficiency
furnaces use a plastic vent and are most often vented out the side wall.
Specifications
•Venting: Natural draft, induced draft, or fan assist, depending on furnace design
•Venting material: B vent, BH vent, or direct vent
•Heat transfer: Forced convection
•Ignition: Standing pilot, spark-ignited pilot, direct spark ignition, hot surface ignition
•Burner control: A thermostat mounted in the space being heated

Furnace Safety Features
High Temperature Limit
Shuts down the furnace if temperature exceeds safe
levels
Flame Roll-Out Switch
Detects flames escaping the heat exchanger
Combustion Air-Proving Switch
Ensures proper air for combustion
Door Switch
Prevents operation when access panels are removed
Blocked Vent Shutoff System
Detects improper venting conditions
Burner Management System
Controls ignition sequence and monitors operation

Up-flow Furnace (High-boy)
Design Characteristics
Up-flow units or high-boy units have the blower under the
heat exchanger with the air flow going upward. You may
install this type of furnace in closets or utility rooms.
There are several types of blower designs to accommodate
different installation requirements. You can find both direct
drive and belt driven blower assemblies in the field today.
The up-flow design is one of the most common furnace
configurations in residential applications. It's particularly
well-suited for installations where the ductwork runs
through the attic or upper floors of the building.

Down-flow Furnace
Down-flow furnaces are specifically designed for applications
where the heating ducts are located beneath the furnace, such as
in crawl spaces or basements.
Design Characteristics
Down-flow units have the blower above the heat exchanger with
the air flow going downward. You can find down-flow units usually
in trailers and mobile homes, as well as in single-storey buildings
where the heating supply duct is installed beneath the floor.
This configuration is ideal when space constraints require the
furnace to be installed on the main floor with ductwork running
below.

Low-boy Furnace
Design Characteristics
The low-boy furnace is designed for installations with height
restrictions, such as crawl spaces or areas with low ceilings.
This configuration features a more horizontal layout
compared to traditional up-flow or down-flow designs,
allowing it to fit in spaces where vertical clearance is limited.
Low-boy furnaces provide the same heating capacity and
efficiency as their taller counterparts but in a more compact
package that can fit in tight spaces.

Duct Furnace
Application
You use duct furnaces in duct distribution systems where
air moving equipment is supplied separately. In some
applications, they function as indirect-fired make-up air
heaters.
Heat Transfer
Forced convection
Ignition
Standing pilot, spark-ignited pilot, direct spark ignition, hot

Unit Heater
Specifications
•Heat transfer: Forced convection
•Ignition: Standing pilot, spark ignited pilot, direct spark ignition, hot
surface ignition
•Burner control: Manual switch or wall-mounted thermostat
•Safeties: High-temperature limit switch, blocked vent shutoff system
Clause 7.28 of CSA B149.1 contains general installation requirements for
unit heaters.
Unit heaters are compact, self-contained heating appliances that are
typically suspended from the ceiling or mounted on walls in commercial
and industrial spaces. They provide efficient spot heating and are
commonly used in warehouses, workshops, and other large open areas.

Swimming Pool Heater
Installation Considerations
Most pool heaters include all necessary controls, including a pool temperature control and water
that reduces condensation in the heater. You can find water heating appliances installed in the
water circulation system of the pool at a point between the treatment stage and the pool.
Special Challenges
Swimming pool heaters may have problems not encountered with other water heaters and boilers
because of the low water temperature at which they operate. In view of the condensation, which can
be a problem, you should take extra care with respect to sizing, water flow, combustion air, and
regular maintenance.
Installation Restrictions
As a result of these ongoing maintenance issues and harsh operating environments, the installation
of swimming pool heaters of the finned-tube type within a building that houses occupants is not
allowed.
Code Requirements
Clause 7.26 of CSA B149.1 contains general installation requirements for Pool Heaters.

Hot Water Boiler
Overview
Domestic and commercial space heating commonly employ hot water boiler
contains water, and a control system keeps the water at a preset temperature.
A pump helps circulate the hot water through the heating system.
Clause 7.1 of CSA B149.1 contains general installation requirements for hot
water boilers.
Specifications
•Heat transfer: Convection and radiation
•Ignition system: Standing pilot, spark-ignited pilot, direct spark ignition,
hot surface ignition

Hot Water Boiler Controls and Safeties
Make-up Water Supply
Whenever boiler water pressure drops below a set point, you
must supply make-up water.
Pressure Reducing Valve
The pressure reducing valve is set at a point below which boiler
pressure must not drop. The valve allows the make-up water to
enter and bring the boiler pressure back to the proper level.
Expansion Tank
As the temperature of the water increases, the water expands.
The expansion tank partially contains air, which compresses as
the water expands and enters the expansion tank, allowing the
system pressure to remain stable.
Stop Valves
Stop valves help isolate the boiler from the system piping.
Operating Temperature Limit Control
The operating temperature limit control monitors the water
temperature and interlocks with the burner.

More Hot Water Boiler Safety Features
High Temperature Limit Control
If the operating limit control fails, the high-limit control
will shut the burner down. You must set the high-limit
control at a higher temperature than the operating limit
control.
Low Water Cut-off
A low water cut-off is required on hot water boilers when
the input is in excess of 400,000 Btu/h (117 kW) or when
the boiler is above the hot water circulating system. It
interlocks with the burner to cause a shutdown if the
water level drops below the set point.
Flow Switch
Codes may require a flow switch on any copper fin tube
type and/or low mass boiler, especially when the firing
rate exceeds 400,000 Btu/h (117 kW).
Safety Relief Valve
If the pressure in the boiler rises above the set point, the
safety relief valve will open and remain open until the
pressure drops to a safe level.

Steam Boiler
Overview
It is uncommon to use steam boilers for domestic purposes.
Generally, people use it to heat large spaces or for industrial
processing.
Steam boilers partially contain water and the space at the top
of boiler allows steam to accumulate (steam drum). The
combustion control system monitors steam pressure.
Clause 7.1 of CSA B149.1 contains general installation
requirements for steam boilers.
Specifications
•Heat transfer: Convection and radiation
•Ignition system: Standing pilot, spark-ignited pilot, direct
spark ignition, hot surface ignition

Steam Boiler Controls and Safeties

Steam Gauge
Registers steam pressure in the boiler
Operating Pressuretrol
Controls steam pressure in the boiler, interlocks with the burner
High-Limit Pressuretrol
Set higher than the operating pressuretrol, interlocks with the burner to cause shutdown if the operating pressuretrol should fail
Pump Control
Maintains proper water level in the boiler, which is visible through the gauge glass

More Steam Boiler Safety Features
Low Water Cut-off/Hartford Loop
Required on all steam boilers, interlocks with the burner, and causes shutdown if the water in the boiler drops below the required level
Safety Valve

Check Valve
Allows flow in only one direction, required on the condensate return line to the boiler
Return Tank
Condensate from the piping system returns to the tank and is fed to the boiler via the pump
Feedwater Pump
Supplies water to the boiler as required

Hartford Loop in Steam Boilers
Definition and Purpose
A Hartford Loop is an arrangement of piping between a steam boiler's header and its gravity-return piping. The
end of the header drops vertically below the boiler's waterline and connects into the bottom of the boiler.
The pipe is termed the "equalizer" because it balances the pressure between the boiler's steam outlet and
condensate-return inlet.
Function and Benefits
The "wet" gravity return line, which returns the condensate from the system, rises from the floor to join the
equalizer at a point about 2 inches below the boiler's lowest operating water line.
The piping arrangement is not fail-safe, but it is an improvement over the old way of returning condensate directly
into the bottom of the boiler. A low water cut-off should protect the boiler against a sudden loss of water, but with
a gravity-return system, a Hartford Loop is a cost-effective method to back up a low-water cut-off should a
return rupture and water suddenly leave the boiler.

Combination Unit
Overview
A combination unit is a hot water that supplies water for domestic use, as well
as a fan coil unit that heats air for space heating. More elaborate systems can
also supply hot water for in-floor radiant space heating.
Specifications
•Heat transfer: Conduction, convection, or radiation
•Ignition system: Standing pilot, spark-ignited pilot, direct spark ignition,
hot surface ignition
•Burner control: Aquastat thermostat
•Safeties: High limit aquastat, temperature pressure relief valves
•Note: All components must have approval for potable water
This illustration shows a combination fan coil unit with storage-type water
heater. All piping and safety requirements may not be shown. This illustration
is for education purposes only. Adherence to local code requirements, as well
as manufacturer's certified instructions is essential to efficient and safe
operation of any combustion appliance.

Infrared Heater
Overview
An open flame can produce infrared energy. However, modern infrared systems use burning gas to heat a
radiating surface. (These heated surfaces are better radiators than naked flames.) The radiating surfaces undergo
heating by direct flame contact or with the products of combustion.
Clause 7.23 of CSA B149.1 contains general installation requirements for infrared heaters, which people primarily
use for commercial or industrial purposes.
Specifications
•Heat transfer: Predominantly radiation
•Ignition: Standing pilot, spark-ignited pilot, direct spark ignition, hot surface ignition
•Burner control: Thermostat
•Safeties: High-temperature limit switch, air proving switch for fan-operated system

Low-Intensity Infrared Heater
Design and Operation
In low-intensity infrared heaters, combustion occurs in tubes or
panels that are made of metal or ceramic. The tubes radiate heat to
reflectors, which in turn direct the heat source to the floor.
The surface temperature may be as high as 1200°F (648°C) and the
units are generally vented to the atmosphere.
Low-intensity infrared heaters are commonly used in large spaces
like warehouses, aircraft hangars, and manufacturing facilities
where zone heating is more efficient than heating the entire space.
They provide comfortable radiant heat that warms objects and
people directly rather than heating the air.

High-Intensity Infrared Heater
High-intensity infrared heaters are often used in outdoor or semi-
outdoor applications such as restaurant patios, loading docks, and
sports venues where direct, intense heat is needed.
Design and Operation
High-intensity infrared heaters (often called "surface combustion
infrared heaters") are made of porous ceramics, drilled port
ceramics, stainless steel, or a metallic screen.
A combustible mixture of gas and air enters the enclosure and
flows through the refractory material, at which point the gas
ignites. Since the gas evenly spreads on the exposed surface, the
flame is quite steady.
The surface temperature may rise as high as 1800°F (982°C). To
reach these high temperatures, you may use an atmospheric
burner if the porosity is suitable; if not, you must use a power
burner.
You must not connect high-intensity infrared heaters to a vent.
They must, however, be in a well-ventilated area.

Water Heaters
Overview
A gas water heater heats water for cooking, dishwashing, clothes washing, lavatories,
baths, and showers. It does not heat water for space or central heating.
There are two common ways to heat the water: instantaneously, as water is needed, and
stored in a tank at constant temperature.
Instantaneous Water Heater
Tankless water heaters can provide an instant, endless supply of hot water within their
net capacity and operating conditions. Though these units modulate, their net output
firing rate capabilities and the temperature differential between the incoming water
temperature and their set output temperature determine their minimum and maximum
GPM yield.

Tankless Water Heater Performance
Flow Rate Considerations
Pressure drop through tankless units increases with flow rate. They typically have substantially higher firing rates than tank-type hot
water heaters; therefore, they have far better recovery rates.
Since these systems function on an on-demand basis, they don't require a holding tank to store pre-warmed water. Having no storage
or holding reserve means that tankless water heaters have a life span that's potentially twice as long as traditional systems, because the
risk of rust and corrosion may significantly drop with proper maintenance.
This chart shows maximum GPM yield for specific tankless water heater models based on pressure drop and temperature differential
variables. Careful adherence to the manufacturer's installation requirements for these units is essential to their proper functionality and
is the responsibility of the installer.

Storage-Type Water Heater
This unit is typical, however, limited in its recovery due to significantly lower
firing rates. Its advantage over tankless type water heaters is its initial capacity
and negligible pressure drop at high flow rates.
Comparing Tank vs. Tankless
Gas technicians/fitters often get questions on their opinion regarding
comparisons of tankless versus tank-type water heaters; however, there may
not always be a clear "best choice".
Through an analysis of the potential system variables, such as potential GPM
requirements, water hardness, and outputing and receives, potential Grill
requirements, supply water procesure halp a lines, potential changes to
gas/potable pipe sizing and supply water pressure help advise a customer of
the advantages/disadvantages/disadvantages/disadvantages/of both.
You must take application and site conditions into consideration.

Dual-Tank Water Heating System
Design and Operation
Figure 5-23 shows another version of a storage water heater where one tank houses water heating and
a larger tank stores the water. Gravity or a circulating pump helps circulate the water is circulated
through the heater.
This system allows storage of large amounts of water for intermittent draw and uses a smaller heating
tank. Additionally, the heating tank can supply water that is of a different temperature from that in the
large storage tank.
Specifications
•Heat transfer: Conduction
•Ignition: Standing pilot, spark-ignited pilot, direct spark ignition, hot surface ignition
•Burner control: Aquastat, non-electric valves
•Safeties: Temperature and pressure relief valves, high-limit aquastat, FVIR design
Clause 7.27 of CSA B149.1 contains general installation requirements for water heaters.

FVIR Water Heater Design
Safety Innovation
Flammable Vapor Ignition Resistance (FVIR) is a technology
developed for gas-fired water heaters that resists ignition of
flammable vapours that may occur outside and near a water
heater as a result of the mishandling of flammable products.
This helps guard against such an incident and reduce the
risk of the water heater becoming a source of ignition.
FVIR technology typically includes flame arrestors and
sealed combustion chambers that prevent external vapors
from being ignited by the water heater's burner. This safety
feature has become standard on residential gas water
heaters to prevent accidents involving flammable vapors
from products like gasoline, paint thinners, or solvents.

Decorative Gas Appliances
Overview
Clause 7.25 of CSA B149.1 contains general installation
requirements for decorative gas appliances such as gas logs.
Specifications
•Heat transfer: Predominantly radiation
•Ignition: Standing pilot
•Burner control: None
•Safeties: None
•Venting: Chimney, chimney liner, and type B vent
Decorative gas appliances are designed primarily for
aesthetic purposes rather than as a primary heat source.
They create a realistic flame appearance while providing
some radiant heat to the surrounding area.

Vented Gas Fireplace
Types and Installation
Vented gas fireplaces (previously called decorative gas
appliances) include fireplace inserts, free-standing stoves,
and zero-clearance units. Clause 7.25 of CSA B149.1 contains
general installation requirements for decorative gas
appliances, including vented gas fireplaces.
Specifications
•Heat transfer: Convection, radiation
•Ignition: Standing pilot, piezo igniter, hot surface ignition
•Burner control: Thermostat or manual switch
•Safeties: Blocked vent safety shut-off switch
•Venting: Direct vent, Type B vent, flexible liners
Fireplace inserts are designed to fit into existing masonry
fireplaces, converting them from wood-burning to gas. They
provide efficient heating while maintaining the aesthetic
appeal of a traditional fireplace.

Free-Standing Gas Stove
Free-standing gas stoves offer flexibility in placement as
they don't require an existing fireplace structure. They can
be positioned in various locations within a room, provided
proper venting and clearances are maintained.
Design and Features
Free-standing gas stoves are self-contained heating
appliances that simulate the appearance of traditional wood
stoves while offering the convenience of gas fuel.
These units typically feature viewing windows on multiple
sides, allowing the flame to be visible from different angles
in the room.
Modern free-standing gas stoves often include features
such as remote controls, programmable thermostats, and
battery backup systems for operation during power outages.

Zero-Clearance Gas Fireplace
Design and Installation
Zero-clearance gas fireplaces are factory-built units designed to
be installed with minimal clearance to combustible materials.
These units are ideal for new construction or renovations where a
traditional masonry fireplace isn't practical. They can be framed
directly into walls using standard building materials.
Most zero-clearance fireplaces use direct venting, which draws
combustion air from outside and exhausts combustion products to
the exterior through a dual-channel vent system.
Zero-clearance fireplaces offer significant installation flexibility, as
they can be placed in locations where traditional fireplaces would
be impractical. Their sealed combustion systems also provide
improved energy efficiency compared to traditional open
fireplaces.

Room Space-Heater
Design and Application
The room space-heater is a free-standing, self-contained
unit that is installed in the room where heat is necessary.
Room heaters must be under thermostatic control. The
venting system can be either gravity or forced-air (fan
assisted).
Specifications
•Heat transfer: Convection, radiation
•Ignition: Standing pilot and spark igniter
•Burner control: Thermostat or manual switch
•Safeties: High-temperature limit switch
•Venting: Direct vent, Type B vent
Room space-heaters are commonly used for supplemental
heating in individual rooms or in spaces where central
heating is impractical. They provide localized comfort
without the need to heat an entire building.

Recessed Wall Furnace
Wall furnaces are an excellent solution for heating small spaces
efficiently. Their compact design makes them ideal for applications
where floor space is limited.
Design and Application
The recessed wall furnace takes up less space and is easier to install
than other room heaters. (Wall furnaces were once recessed into the
wall between the wall studs, but now they mount directly on the wall.)
They are self-contained and available with or without a fan.
You can find these appliances in small houses, room additions,
garages, cabins, or motel rooms.
Specifications
•Heat transfer: Conduction
•Ignition: Standing pilot, spark-ignited pilot, direct spark ignition
and hot surface ignition
•Burner control: Thermostat
•Safeties: High-temperature limit switch
•Venting: Type BW vent

Baseboard Heater
Design and Application
Baseboard heaters operate independently from other sources of
heat. They can therefore be installed as required throughout a
building. They are usually vented through an outside wall, rather
than through the ceiling.
This is a low input heating appliance that heats an area within a
room.
Specifications
•Heat transfer: Conduction, convection
•Ignition: Standing pilot, spark igniter pilot, direct spark
ignition, hot surface ignition
•Burner control: Manual switch or thermostat
•Safeties: High temperature limit switch
•Venting: Direct vent
Gas baseboard heaters provide an alternative to electric
baseboard heating, offering the efficiency of gas with the
distributed heating approach of baseboard units. They're
particularly useful in rooms with large windows or exterior walls
where heat loss is a concern.

Rooftop Units
Design and Application
Rooftop units combine both heating and cooling functions within
a self-contained unit mounted on the roof of a building. People
mainly use rooftop units for low-rise commercial and industrial
applications such as commercial shopping centers and industrial
parks.
Specifications
•Heat transfer: Conduction
•Ignition: Spark-ignited pilot, direct spark ignition, hot surface
ignition
•Burner control: Thermostat
•Safeties: High-temperature limit switch, gas pressure, and
mercury pilot proving switches
Rooftop units offer several advantages for commercial
applications, including freeing up valuable interior space,
simplified maintenance access, and reduced noise inside the
building. Their all-in-one design combines heating, cooling, and
ventilation functions in a single package.

Gas-Fired Residential Generators
Residential gas generators provide reliable backup power during
outages, automatically starting when utility power fails and
shutting down when it's restored.
Function and Benefits
You can also install home generator systems to run on your home's
natural gas line or propane supply. When a power failure occurs,
the electric load automatically transfers to the generator set.
Upon restoration of the commercial power service, the electric load
transfers back to the utility line. Because this process is completely
automatic, there is the assurance of a ready supply of electric
power for lighting, heating, air conditioning, and other various
applications.
Installation Considerations
Gas generators require proper ventilation, clearances from
buildings, and connection to the home's electrical system through
a transfer switch. Professional installation by qualified technicians
is essential for safe operation.

Professional Development for Gas Technicians
Manufacturer Training
Most appliance manufacturers offer training on their products
or appliances. In some cases, validation of warranties may not
be possible for equipment that a licensed, factory trained gas
technician/fitter has not installed and/or initiated.
Continuous Learning
It is in every gas technician's best interest to continuously
update their skills with training made available, as this will
provide further employability and added value to your
customers.
Code Compliance
It is the responsibility of the gas technician/fitter to comply
with all codes as well as their local trade regulations.
Scope of Practice
Connections made to gas appliances, including potable,
hydronic, refrigerant, duct work, and electrical connections
that exceed the essential components affecting the safe
operation of the appliance must meet local provincial and
municipal code requirements and may fall outside a gas
technician's/fitter's scope of practice.

Heat Transfer in Gas Appliances
ConductionConvectionRadiationMixed Methods
This chart illustrates the distribution of heat transfer methods across common gas appliances. Convection is the most prevalent method, used in 40% of appliances including furnaces and convection ovens. Conduction
accounts for 30% of appliances, particularly in cooking equipment and water heaters. Radiation is used in 15% of appliances, primarily infrared heaters and decorative fireplaces. The remaining 15% employ a combination of
multiple heat transfer methods for optimal performance.

Ignition Systems in Gas Appliances
Standing Pilot
A small, continuously burning flame that ignites the main burner when needed. Common in older appliances and some modern decorative gas fireplaces.
Advantages include operation without electricity, but they consume gas continuously even when the main burner is off.
Spark Ignition
Uses an electric spark to ignite the gas when the appliance calls for heat. More energy efficient than standing pilots since no gas is consumed during standby
periods. Common in modern ranges, furnaces, and water heaters.
Hot Surface Ignition
Uses an electric heating element that glows red-hot to ignite the gas. Highly reliable and energy efficient. Commonly found in newer furnaces, water heaters, and
boilers. Requires electricity to operate.

Safety Features in Gas Appliances
1
Flame Supervision
Ensures gas flow stops if flame is extinguished
2
Temperature Limits
Prevents overheating of components
Blocked Vent Protection
Detects improper venting conditions
Pressure Relief
Prevents dangerous pressure buildup
CO Detection
Monitors for dangerous carbon monoxide levels
Modern gas appliances incorporate multiple layers of safety features to protect users from potential hazards. These systems work together to ensure safe
operation under normal conditions and to shut down the appliance if unsafe conditions are detected.

Venting Systems for Gas Appliances
Proper venting is critical for the safe operation of gas appliances. The type of venting system used depends on the appliance design, efficiency, and
installation location. Common venting systems include B-vent, direct vent, power vent, and chimney systems. High-efficiency condensing appliances
typically use PVC venting due to the lower temperature of exhaust gases.

Efficiency Comparison of Gas Appliances
Standard Efficiency (%)High Efficiency (%)
This chart compares the efficiency ratings of standard and high-efficiency gas appliances. High-efficiency models utilize advanced technologies like condensing heat exchangers, sealed combustion, and
electronic controls to extract more usable heat from the same amount of fuel. While high-efficiency appliances typically cost more initially, they can provide significant energy savings over their operational
lifetime.

Requirements for
Converting Appliances
Between Propane and
Natural Gas
This presentation covers the essential requirements and responsibilities
for safely converting appliances between propane and natural gas. Gas
technicians must understand the critical differences between these fuel
types and follow proper procedures to ensure safe and effective
conversions.

Purpose of Conversion Requirements
Why Proper Conversion Matters
While natural gas and propane have similarities in appliance
appearance and operation, their differences in specific
gravity and calorific value must be considered when
converting from one fuel to the other.
It is the responsibility of the gas technician/fitter making the
conversion to ensure it is done safely, following all
manufacturers' instructions and gas code requirements.

Learning Objectives
Describe installer's responsibilities
Understand the legal and technical obligations of gas technicians performing
conversions

Required Combustion Analysis
Completeness of Combustion
Verify that fuel is burning efficiently and completely
Test for Toxic Gases
Ensure no dangerous byproducts like carbon monoxide are being produced
Verify Proper Burner Operation
Confirm burners are functioning correctly with the new fuel type

Installer's Responsibilities
Proper Authorization
Only qualified individuals may perform conversions
Follow Procedures
Adhere to manufacturer instructions and codes
Safety First
Ensure all conversions are performed safely
The conversion of appliances from one fuel type to another requires special knowledge and procedures. If performed
incorrectly, the appliance will not function properly and may prove potentially dangerous. The gas technician/fitter must
therefore perform all procedures properly and, in some cases, arrange for inspection of the converted appliance by the
inspection authority or an agency authorized by the inspection authority.

Authorization Requirements
Qualified Personnel
Only authorized individuals have permission to perform fuel type
conversion on appliances with inputs of 400,000 Btu/h or less.
Local Regulations
Check local regulations to determine the applicable qualifications.
Permits
Some jurisdictions may require a permit prior to converting an
appliance to an alternative fuel.
Manufacturer Instructions
Always adhere to manufacturer's certified conversion instructions
when these are available or obtain manufacturer's information.

Pre-Conversion Inspection
Inspect the appliance and heat exchanger
Ensure they are safe for continued use
Remove components for inspection
Check burners, blowers, humidifiers, etc.
Look for damage or wear
Identify scale, holes, cracks, water leaks, and seals
Verify approval for conversion
Confirm existing appliance is approved for conversion

Input Requirements
1
Maintain Same Input
When converting an
appliance, the input must
remain the same, and the
new gas must have a
marking on the rating plate.
2
Consider Orifice and
Pressure
Based on the same orifice
diameter and gas pressure,
propane supplies a greater
input than natural gas.
3
Evaluate Supply Pipe Size
The supply pipe size may need a replacement during the
conversion.

Pipe Sizing Considerations
Natural Gas to Propane
When converting from natural gas (7
in w.c.) to propane (11 in w.c.), unless
the original piping or tubing was
undersized, the requirement for new
piping or tubing is not likely.
Propane to Natural Gas
When converting from propane (11 in
w.c.) to natural gas (7 in w.c.), new gas
piping or tubing will likely need to
satisfy sizing requirements.
New Piping Requirements
When new piping is required, safe
removal and abandonment of the old
piping is a must.

Propane Tank
Decommissioning
Shut off all valves
Ensure all gas flow is stopped completely
Disconnect the pipe or tubing
Safely remove all connections to the tank
Plug the openings
Seal all openings to prevent gas leakage

Venting and Air
Requirements
Based on Input
The requirements for venting and combustion air are based on input
and, therefore, do not normally undergo modification.
Inspection Required
Checking the venting and air supply ducting to ensure their
compliance with the Code requirements and their good physical
condition is a must.

Important Considerations
for Scenario 2
Burner Orifice Sizing
When performing these conversions, the most important factors
to consider are burner orifice sizing and manifold pressure
settings.
Follow Instructions
It is also very important to follow the manufacturer's instructions.

Scenario 3: Propane Only Certification
Field Approval Required
In this case, the inspection authority or an agency
authorized by the inspection authority (field approved) must
test and label the conversion.
Cost Consideration
Another factor to consider before deciding to proceed with
the conversion is the costs of appliance recertification.

Burner Orifice Sizing
Performing conversions entails the purchase and installation of a
properly sized gas orifice.
A gas orifice is a hole or opening that controls the direction and amount
of gas discharged into a burner. Burner orifices come in a variety of
shapes and sizes, and the actual size and configuration of each orifice
depends on several factors.

Factors Affecting Orifice Design
Type of Gas
This is the most critical factor in orifice design. Although the specific
gravity of propane is higher than natural gas (which will limit the flow
through an orifice), the heat capacity of propane is higher than natural
gas.
Appliance Input
The orifice size directly affects the consumption rate of the appliance.
The larger the appliance capacity, the larger the orifice size.
Manifold Pressure
This influences the size of orifice required, since the greater the pressure,
the greater the volumetric flow through the orifice.

Propane vs. Natural Gas Orifice Size
Heat Capacity Difference
Producing the same amount of heat requires a lesser volume
of propane than when natural gas is used.
Orifice Size Comparison
This means that a propane orifice will always be smaller than
a natural gas orifice for the same heat output.

Maintaining Proper Input Rate
Follow Manufacturer
Specifications
Always keep the appliance input
rate the same as the one that the
appliance manufacturer
specified on the appliance rating
plate or on the certified
conversion kit instructions.
Risks of Improper
Adjustment
Improper input rate adjustment
can result in poor burner flame
characteristics and/or the
production of carbon monoxide.
Dangers of Overfiring
Overfiring can result in a potential fire hazard as well as overheating and
destruction of the heat exchangers.

Orifice Sizing Resources
Manufacturer Data
Data about the size of orifice to input capacity for natural gas and
propane is available from manufacturers.
CSA B149.1 Annex I
Refer to Annex I General information of CSA B149.1 for orifice
sizing information.

Manifold Pressure Adjustment
In addition to changing the orifice size, the appliance manifold pressure requires adjustment. This procedure requires you to
use pressure measuring equipment (a manometer) to confirm that the correct manifold pressure has been obtained.

Manifold Pressure Adjustment
Procedures
1
Certified Conversion Kits
The appliance manufacturer will indicate whether or not any adjustments to the
manifold pressure are required. In all cases, check that the gas supply pressure
immediately upstream of the manifold falls within the recommended range for the
appliance.
2
No Certified Conversion Kits
When no certified conversion kits are available but the appliance has received
certification for both fuels, obtain original testing data from the agency certifying the
appliance. Adjust the manifold pressure accordingly.

Manifold Pressure
Specifications
Stay Within Specifications
Always keep the manifold pressure within the range specified by the
appliance manufacturer, since adjustments beyond this range can
adversely affect the burner operation.
Risks of Low Pressure
Pressures that are too low may not entrain enough air into the burner.
Risks of High Pressure
Pressures that are too high may entrain too much air.
Carbon Monoxide Risk
In either case, poor burner flame characteristics can occur, resulting in
production of carbon monoxide.

Typical Manifold Pressures

Conversion Documentation
Record all conversion details
Document all parts changed and adjustments made

Furnace Cleaning Overview
Filter System
Replace or clean filters to ensure
proper airflow
Blower
Clean blower assembly to prevent
airflow restrictions
Motor
Maintain motor according to
manufacturer specifications
Always ensure that the power supply is turned off before beginning these furnace cleaning steps!

Filter System Cleaning
Filter Inspection
•Take it out and hold it up to the light
•If it looks clogged, replace it with a new filter of the
same type and size regardless of the length of time it
has been used
Filter Replacement
•An electronic air cleaner should have cartridges
cleaned in accordance with the manufacturer's
instructions
•Permanent screen filters should be removed and
cleaned

Types of Furnace Filters
Disposable Furnace Filter
•Consists of a fibre mesh in a cardboard frame
•The size of the filter is printed on the edge of the frame
•An arrow on the edge of the frame indicates the correct direction of
air flow through the filter
•Air flows from the return-air duct toward the blower
•The arrow on the filter should point away from the return-air duct
and toward the blower
Permanent Filter
•Usually sprayed with a special filter-coating chemical, available at
hardware stores and home centers
•Clean this type of filter according to the manufacturer's instructions,
which are usually attached to furnace housing

Blower Cleaning
Blower Assembly
You must clean the blower assembly, belts
and pulleys to the blower, and motor
housing. Cleaning the blower is critical if
the furnace has a squirrel-cage fan
because openings in this type of blower
often become clogged with dirt.
Squirrel-Cage Fan
This type of blower can easily become
clogged with dirt, restricting airflow and
reducing efficiency.
Accessing the Blower
Remove the panel that covers the filter to
gain access to the blower or panel on the
front of the furnace. This panel may be
slip-fit on hooks or held by a series of
retaining screws. Sliding out the fan Unit,
which is held on track by screws, may help
you gain access to inside of the blower.

Motor Cleaning
Access Electrical Panel
It may be necessary to swing out
an electrical panel or module
control on high-efficiency Units
Check Fan Belt
Check the condition of fan belt if
equipped
Maintain Motor
Maintain the fan motor with oil, if
the manufacturer advises

Additional Cleaning Considerations
Air-Conditioning A-Coils
Other items of concern are the
underside of air-conditioning A-coils,
as they can become clogged with dirt
and act as a dirty filter would.
Secondary Heat Exchanger
Additionally, on high-efficiency Units
the secondary heat exchanger, which
you can access while the blower
assembly is removed, may require
cleaning in order to remove dirt build
up on the coil surface.
Condensate Drain
You should clean the condensate
drain tubing, specifically on high-
efficiency Units, and confirm it to be
free running all the way to the floor
drain to ensure trouble-free drainage.

Reactivation Process Overview
Pre-checks
Complete all pre-reactivation
checklists
Gasification
Introduce gas to the system
System Testing
Check for leaks and proper pressure
Ignition
Light the appliance following
manufacturer's instructions
Analysis
Perform combustion analysis
When the appliance is ready for reactivation, you must re-check the system after its gasification and before you light up the
appliance. In all cases, you must perform combustion analysis to determine the completeness of combustion and to test for
toxic gases before leaving the appliance in operation.

Natural Gas Regulator
Activation
Important Note
You should turn on the main valve to a natural gas regulator/meter
set slowly when reactivating a system. If turned on too quickly, the
regulator will not have time to react, which could cause overpressure
damage to the meter diaphragm, regulator, and other downstream
gas controls.

Checking System Once
Gasified
Visual Inspection
Visually check the piping to ensure there are no openings in the
system from which gas could escape

Carbon Monoxide Safety
Deadly Hazard
Can cause serious illness or death
Venting Issues
Most common cause is venting problems
Detection
Proper testing is essential
The most common cause of carbon monoxide poisoning from gas equipment is due to venting system problems. This is why
thorough inspection of the venting system is the first priority before reactivating any gas appliance.

Flame Characteristics
Proper Flame
A proper gas flame should be blue with slight yellow tips. It should be stable and consistent across all burners.
Improper Flame
Yellow flames indicate incomplete combustion, which can produce carbon monoxide. This requires immediate adjustment.
Flame Impingement
When flames touch heating surfaces directly, it can cause overheating, damage, and inefficient operation.

Flame Problems to Watch For
Flame Lift-off
When flames lift away from the burner ports, it indicates improper gas pressure or air-to-fuel ratio. This can lead to flame
outage and gas accumulation.
Flame Roll-out
When flames extend outside the combustion chamber, it indicates a serious problem such as blocked heat exchanger or
insufficient combustion air. This can cause overheating of components and is a fire hazard.

Venting Action Verification
Proper Draft
•Use a draft gauge to measure the draft in the vent connector
•Compare readings to manufacturer specifications
•Adjust barometric damper if necessary
Spillage Test
•Hold a smoke pencil or match near the draft hood
•Smoke should be drawn into the draft hood
•No spillage should occur after 30 seconds of operation

Safety Controls Verification
High Limit Controls
Prevent overheating by
shutting down the system
when temperature exceeds
safe levels
Flame Safeguards

Clocking the Meter
Time Gas Flow
Time how long it takes for one cubic foot of gas to flow
Calculate BTU Input
Convert flow rate to BTU input using gas heating value
Compare to Rating
Compare calculated input to appliance rating plate
Adjust if Needed
Adjust gas pressure if input is not within 5% of rating

Clocking the Meter Formula
Formula for Natural Gas
BTU Input = (3600 × Heating Value) ÷ Seconds per cubic foot
•3600 = seconds in an hour
•Heating Value = BTU per cubic foot (typically 1000 for natural
gas)
•Seconds per cubic foot = time measured during test
Example Calculation
If it takes 40 seconds for the meter to complete one revolution of 1
cubic foot:
BTU Input = (3600 × 1000) ÷ 40 = 90,000 BTU/hr

Manifold Pressure Adjustment
When No Meter is Available
When a gas meter is not available for clocking, you must ensure:
1.The proper orifice is installed according to manufacturer
specifications
2.The manifold pressure is set correctly using a manometer
3.All adjustments match the manufacturer's specified rating
Most gas valves have an adjustment screw for setting the
manifold pressure. Always refer to the manufacturer's
instructions for the correct procedure and specifications.
