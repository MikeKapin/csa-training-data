Flow Rates with Pressure
(Volume) and Temperature
Compensation
As the temperature of a gas increases, the volume of the gas increases,
unless it is restricted in a container; in that case, the pressure in the
container increases.
Most gas meters are equipped with temperature compensating devices
to correct the actual volume of gas that passes through the meter to a
standardized volume measurement at a standardized temperature (1
cubic foot at 60°F or 1 cubic metre at 15.4 °C).
When temperature is a factor in measuring flow rate with gas pressures
over 0.5 psig, and the meter is not corrected, use the following formula to
calculate the flow rate.

Barometric Pressure
Considerations
The local weather bureaus generally report barometric pressures that are
corrected to sea level. In the above equation, the actual barometric
pressure must be used. This can be obtained from the weather bureau.

Electronic Correctors
Electronic metering systems do all the things mechanical devices do
(Figure 3-10), plus they have many more features such as continuous
temperature, pressure, correction factor readouts, indications of gas flow
conditions, and storage of load survey data. Some of this information can
be accessed by the gas fitter using the scroll buttons, whereas more
detailed information requires a computer connection with the
appropriate software. The amount of information that can be accessed
depends on the type and complexity of the device.

Electronic Corrector
Applications
Electronic metering devices are typically found on large commercial and
industrial installations. Electronic correctors employ a magnetic sensing
device to sense each rotation of the meter that represents the non-
compensated (UNC-uncorrected) meter gas volume. The volumetric
input pulses are also converted to base measurement conditions (COR-
corrected).

Common Electronic
Correcting Systems
•electronic temperature compensating index (TCI); and
•electronic volume corrector (EVC).

Electronic Temperature
Compensating Index (TCI)
A TCI converts gas volume from operating conditions to reference
temperature conditions. The temperature is measured by a temperature
sensor located in the temperature well of the meter. A pressure
transducer is also mounted inside the meter or as a separate piping
connection.

Electronic Volume Corrector (EVC)
An EVC converts gas volume from operating conditions to reference pressure and temperature conditions. The temperature is
measured by a temperature sensor located in the temperature of the meter. A pressure transducer is also mounted inside the
meter or as a separate piping connection.

Correction Factor Calculation
The pressure and temperature correction factors are calculated by the same formulas previously mentioned. Depending on
how the utility has set up the meter display, there are many parameters that could be viewed. Figure 3-11 shows the gas
temperature and the calculated correction factor for a TCI. Because this meter is located indoors, the gas temperature is above
the 15 ° C base conditions; therefore, the correction factor is less than one. Notice that the temperature correction factor is
quite small unless the temperatures are very extreme.

EVC Unit Screens
In Figure 3-12, the two screens of an EVC unit show the absolute pressure on the left and the pressure correction factor on the right.

EVC Unit for Clocking
Purposes
When using EVC unit for clocking purposes, the test dial display, also
known as the live flow rate, may or may not be corrected depending on
the parameter settings. You may have to contact the utility or meter
manufacturer to verify which parameters are being displayed. The meter
shown in

Live Corrected Flow Rate
Figure 3-13 is displaying the live corrected flow rate in cu ft/h for a 55
MBH appliance. This is useful for checking the appliance input, as there is
no need to clock the meter or perform any correction factor calculations.
You only need to multiply the flow rate by the appropriate CV of the gas
for that area. Be aware that the utility could have the meter set up to
display the live flow rate as cu ft/h or m3/h.

Using a Meter to Leak Test
Piping Systems
A diaphragm or bellows meter can also be used for leak testing a piping
system at working pressure. Rotary meters and orifice meters are not
considered sufficiently accurate at measuring small volumes of gas to be
reliably used for this purpose.

Steps for Leak Testing with
a Diaphragm Meter
1.Turn off all gas consuming devices (appliances and pilots) as close to
the appliance as possible.
2.Mark the position of both test dials on the meter display using a non-
permanent marker. See Figure 3-9.
3.After waiting at least ten minutes, check to see if either dial has
moved from the marked position.

Interpreting Leak Test
Results
Movement of the test dials indicates that gas has passed through the
meter and is leaking from the pipe (if all gas-consuming devices have
been completely shut off). The source of the leak must be investigated
and corrected.

Why Mark Both Test Dials?
Both test dials are marked during the meter leak test in case one dial
moves back to its original position at the end of the test. Since the two
dials are moving at different speeds, they are unlikely to both return to
their original position.

Importance of Accurate Flow Rate Measurement
Accurate measurement of gas flow rates is crucial for ensuring the safe and efficient operation of gas appliances. It helps in
verifying that the burner input conforms to manufacturer specifications and prevents potential hazards.

Role of Gas Technicians
Gas technicians and fitters play a vital role in maintaining gas systems.
Their expertise in understanding different meter types, performing
accurate calculations, and conducting leak tests is essential for public
safety and optimal appliance performance.

Advancements in Metering
Technology
The evolution from mechanical dial-type meters to advanced electronic
correctors highlights the continuous improvement in gas measurement
technology. These advancements provide more precise data and
additional features for comprehensive monitoring and analysis of gas
flow.

Ensuring Compliance and Safety
Adhering to gas regulations and standards is paramount. Regular checks of burner input and diligent leak testing procedures
are critical steps in ensuring that gas equipment operates safely and efficiently, protecting both property and lives.

Continuous Learning in Gas
Measurement
The field of gas measurement is dynamic, with ongoing developments in
technology and best practices. Continuous learning and staying updated
with the latest tools and techniques are important for gas technicians to
excel in their profession and ensure high standards of service.

Fuel Containers
Propane gas equipment is normally supplied from either a cylinder or a
tank. To ensure a steady supply of gas, the container and accessories
must be sized and installed to meet the appliance needs under all
temperature and weather conditions.

Natural Gas Supply
Natural gas is normally supplied from a natural well. It travels
from the well through a large pipeline to a city or town gate
station operated by local utility. From here it is distributed to
each building via service piping. It passes through a meter
set before it reaches the consumer. A steady supply of
natural gas is ensured if the piping and tubing systems, as
well as the required pressure regulators, are operating
correctly.
Propane Supply
For propane, sufficient storage capacity is required to meet
the total demand of installed appliances and equipment,
especially during cold weather. It is thus extremely
important to select the correct propane container.

Propane Container Services
and Regulations
Propane companies normally lease propane tanks and cylinders to
customers and then provide a filling service for the tank and an exchange
service for the cylinder.
Propane cylinders are intended for transportation both empty and filled,
and tanks are intended to remain stationary once they are placed in
service and filled.
Due to the need for safety, a number of standards and regulations that
govern the type, location, and size of propane storage containers are in
place. Refer to CSA B149.2 for these requirements.

Cylinders
CSA B149.2 states that all cylinders must be fabricated, tested,
inspected, and legibly marked in accordance with CSA B339 and the
Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations from Transport Canada
(www.tc.gc.ca).
Refillable cylinders will have the important information shown in Figure
4-1 stamped on their protective collar.

Cylinder Markings:
Construction Standard
Additional information regarding these markings is provided below.
Construction Standard
Only TC standards are currently
acceptable in Canada. However,
older cylinders may reference
CTC or DOT (e.g., CTC/DOT 240
4BA). Note: "M" at the end
indicates metric units.
Manufacturer's Name
Such as: Worthington,
Manchester, etc.
Date of Manufacture
Such as: 12 10 or Dec 10

Cylinder Markings: Re-inspection and Capacity
Date of Re-inspection
Cylinders with a water capacity of 240 lb or less must be
recertified within 10 years of the date of manufacture or date
of re-inspection. The cylinder recertification facility must
stamp the collar with the cylinder's identification number
and date of recertification (e.g., AAO311096).
Note: Prior to June 1994, it was acceptable to simply stamp
the date of re-inspection followed by an "E" meaning visual
re-inspection.
Capacity
The volume of the cylinder is given in pounds or kilograms of
water at 130°F (e.g., WC 240#). This is the capacity of the
cylinder when filled with water. From this, you can quickly
determine how much propane can be safely stored in the
container by multiplying by .42 (since propane is .51 the
weight of water and the cylinder must only be filled to the
80% capacity to allow for expansion). Therefore, a 240 lb
w.c. cylinder can safely hold 100 lb of propane.
Note: The largest cylinder that is made has a capacity of
1000 lb of water (420 lb propane).

Cylinder Filling Methods and Overfill Prevention
When using a scale to fill, note that the weight of the cylinder and valves when empty is added to the weight of propane put
into it.
Some cylinders have a "spit valve" for filling without a scale. The spit valve is a small orifice threaded valve equipped with a dip
tube that extends down to the 80% level of the tank. When the spit valve is manually opened during filling operations, it will
start to spit liquid propane when the liquid level reaches 80% at which time the filling operation must be stopped.
Cylinders manufactured after January 1, 2008, with a capacity of 40 lb (18.2 kg) or less were required to have an overfill
prevention device (OPD) in compliance with UL 2227, Standard for Overfilling Prevention Devices. An OPD, as shown in Figure
4-2, prevents filling beyond the 80% capacity.

Working Pressure Rating
and Cylinder Components
Working pressure rating is usually given as 375 psig (2586 kPa) since the
relief set point of cylinder relief valves is 375 psig.
Cylinders come in a variety of sizes. Figure 4-3 shows the common sizes
as well as components of a typical propane cylinder.

Propane Storage Tanks
When a larger installation is planned, propane storage tanks are often
required to deliver a sufficient flow of propane to meet the demand of
connected appliances. Tanks may also be preferred when the number of
cylinders required is inconvenient to handle or when the delivery
schedule is not frequent enough to ensure a continuous supply.
As with propane cylinders, propane storage tanks have a label attached
to them to identify their characteristics. A typical ASME propane storage
tank nameplate is shown in Figure 4-4.

Valves and Accessories
The design of valves, controls, and accessories found on propane tanks and cylinders vary greatly with the design of the containers, manufacturers, and local code requirements. Stationary cylinders or tanks
(Figure 4-5) must contain a:
•service valve;
•filler valve;
•safety pressure relief valve; and
•fixed liquid level gauge.
Portable cylinders have only one opening in the service end. A combination service valve is usually installed in this opening.

Service Valve Connections
An independent service valve controls the flow of gas out of the
container. This type of valve is found on both a propane cylinder and a
propane tank. The outlet of the service valve is called a service
connection. There are two main types of vapour service connections on
cylinders and tanks:
•Prestolite (POL); and
•quick closing coupling (QCC).
POL valves are the oldest standard for propane tank connections. They
have a left-hand thread on the inside of the valve outlet (Figure 4-6). The
POL fitting is unique to vapour service and cannot accidentally be
connected to a liquid line.

QCC Connection for Acme
Valves
QCC connection used for Acme valves (Figure 4-7) differs from POL
valves in its size and use of external threads. Easier to use QCC
connection can be tightened by hand. Acme propane valves are also
compatible with appliances that have POL connections, as they also have
the internal left-hand threads. A big advancement over the POL valve is
the addition of a built-in safety device that allows gas to flow only when
the tank is attached to a device, preventing accidental leakage while
being stored.
Figure 4-7 Acme service valve Courtesy of Camosun College, Rodney
Lidstone, licenced under CC BY

Liquid Service Connections
Liquid service connections usually have a special thread (Figure 4-8) designed by the Compressed Gas Association (CGA).
This unique fitting prevents the valve from being accidentally connected to a vapour service valve. Unlike the vapour
withdrawal valve, the liquid withdrawal valve has a right-hand thread.

Changeover Manifold Assemblies
Cylinders and tanks may also have changeover manifold assemblies attached to them (Figure 4-9). These devices are used in installations where there are two cylinders or tanks in use. It allows the propane supply to be switched from the supply tank to a reserve tank when the
propane pressure in the supply tank drops below a certain point. This changeover is done without disrupting the supply.
The main supply tank can then be refilled while the reserve tank continues to supply propane to the attached systems. The manifold assembly has a method of indicating that it has switched the supply from one tank to another. There are many different types of changeover
manifold assemblies, but they all perform the same operation. For information on specific manifold assemblies, consult the manufacturer's instructions.

Connectors: Pigtail
A common type of connection on propane tanks and cylinders is a pigtail
(Figure 4-10). This type of copper tubing forms part of the vapour
withdrawal system. It allows for flexibility in movement of the rest of the
piping in the system.

Filler Valve
Stationary tanks and cylinders and tanks, rather than filling through the
service valve, will have a separate filler valve to prevent interruption of
service. The double check valve design allows fuel to enter the tank but
prevents the propane from escaping when the fill hose is disconnected.

Safety Relief Valve
The safety relief valve is one of the most important valves installed in an
LP-gas container. Also known as relief valves, pressure venting valves,
and pop-off valves, their purpose is to automatically relieve excess
pressure that can build up inside a cylinder or tank. For this reason,
propane cylinders should always be stored outdoors in a well-ventilated
area. The pressure relief valve setting for cylinders is 375 psig, and tanks
are either 312 psig or 250 psig.

Liquid Level Indicators
It is important to know the level of the propane liquid in the tank to
ensure the tank is not overfilled and to schedule refills when a stationary
tank is running low.
Float type (face) gauge
A float is located inside the tank and as the liquid level changes, the
movement of the float raises or lowers indicating the liquid level in the
tank or cylinder.
Figure 4-13 Float gauges Courtesy of Rotarex SGR

Fixed Tube Gauge
The fixed liquid level gauge also called the bleeder valve, is the one and only gauging device that accurately depicts the level of propane in the tank when it is being filled. The fixed tube gauge is designed so that during the filling process, when the propane going into the tank
reaches 80%, liquid will come out of the opened valve. The face gauge is not to be used during the refuelling process. During filling, the bleeder valve is opened, and the LP-gas vapour is allowed to vent out the end of the tube. However, when LP-gas liquid reaches the bottom of
the dip tube, a white fog or mist vents out the gauge body. The white mist indicates that the maximum permitted filling level has been reached and the filling operation must be immediately stopped.

Excess Flow Valve
Excess flow valves are in-line valves intended to close upon excessive
discharge of vapour or liquid resulting from a hose or piping break. If flow
exceeds the valve setting, the valve will close, reducing the flow to a
trickle until the pressure across it equalizes. They are available in a large
variety of sizes and body configurations. For example, some propane
service regulators will often have an excess follow valve incorporated into
the tank connection.
Figure 4-15 Excess flow valve Courtesy of RegO Products

Combination Service Valves
These valves combine any number of the three basic valves:
•service;
•filler; and
•safety.
The most common combination is the service and safety relief valve.
The service and safety relief combination valve comes in two distinct forms: one for vapour service, the other for liquid service.
Each combination valve is designed to be used solely with either vapour or liquid containers.

Vapour Service Combination Valve
The combination valve shown in Figure 4-16 is designed for vapour service only. On portable cylinders, the outlet connection
will be used for both service and filling. This combination valve is also equipped with a relief valve and a fixed liquid level gauge.
The relief valve is only designed to relief gas; therefore, it is important that portable tanks with this type of valve be installed
and transport in the upright position.
Figure 4-16 POL combination valve Courtesy of RegO Products

Overfill Protection Device
(OPD)
The OPD valve is a backup system to prevent the overfilling of gas
cylinders. OPD valves use a special float that rises during refilling to block
the valve when the cylinder is 80% full.
All small capacity cylinders (4# to 40#) now come from the factory
equipped with an OPD. A cylinder that comes with an OPD can be
recognized by the unique triangular-shaped hand wheel (Figure 4-17) as
well as by the letters OPD stamped on the valve and the valve handle.

Liquid Service Combination Valve
A combination valve used for liquid withdrawal is shown in Figure 4-18. It is designed for liquid service since it comes with a
CGA 555 connection.
Figure 4-18 Combination valve for liquid service
The excess-flow valve protects the container against uncontrolled discharge of LP-gas in case the gas line breaks. The
excess-flow valve is installed in the liquid dip tube. The dip tube completely isolates LP-gas liquid from the inlet to the relief
valve. But vapour is free to flow around the dip tube to the inlet of the safety relief valve.

Sizing and Installing
Cylinders and Tanks
When sizing a propane container, the most important consideration is
the vapour or liquid withdrawal capacity of the container. The container
must always have a propane withdrawal capacity that is high enough for
the application. If the container's propane capacity is too low (having an
undersized tank or cylinder), the appliances may not operate properly.
You will briefly review the propane vapourization process before
discussing the procedures for sizing propane containers. Knowing how
propane reacts under temperature and pressure changes will increase
your understanding of the factors that influence container sizing.

Propane Vapourization
Propane is made up of hydrogen and carbon atoms. Under normal atmospheric pressure, propane is a vapour. To store propane, the vapour is pressurized and stored as a liquid. Although it is stored as a liquid, when filled to capacity, only 80% of the container is filled with liquid,
the rest of the container is filled with vapourized gas. Overfilling the storage container reduces the volume available for vapourization and may result in liquid withdrawal or a hydrostatic pressure buildup.
The relationship between the propane liquid and vapour is constant unless the temperature of the propane changes or the pressure inside the container changes.
When the temperature of propane liquid inside a pressurized container increases, the liquid boils and vapourizes. This vapourization increases the pressure in the container. Since there is a relationship between temperature and pressure, this boiling continues until the
temperature and pressure reach equilibrium at a new point (Figure 4-19).
Another way to make the liquid boil is to release some pressure. When the supply valve opens and discharges vapour, a drop in pressure occurs. As a result, the liquid immediately boils off, trying to re-establish the same pressure that was in the container before the valve was
opened. When the valve closes, the liquid continues to boil off until the cylinder is re-pressurized.

Vapourization Rate
The vapourization rate of a container is the volume of propane that can be boiled off inside the container during a period of time. The vapourization rate is expressed in cubic feet or cubic meters of vapour per hour. When sizing a container for vapour service, always ensure that
the container's vapourization rate is equal to, or greater than, the demand for propane. If it is smaller, the appliances will not operate at their rated inputs due to low pressure.
There are six basic factors that affect the vapourization rate of a propane container.
These factors either slow down the boiling rate or speed it up.
As a result, the vapourization rate either increases or decreases due to these factors.
Figure 4-20 Liquid propane boiling inside pressurized chamber

Factors Affecting Vapourization Rate: Surface
Area and Ambient Temperature
Surface area of tank
Heat is transferred through the walls of the container. The
specific area of the tank that comes in contact with the
propane liquid is called the wetted surface area. In effect,
the larger the wetted surface area, the higher the
vapourization rate.
Ambient temperature
Temperature directly affects the vapourization rate. If the
ambient temperature (temperature around the wetted
surface area) is high, as in summertime, more heat is
transferred to the liquid. When the outside temperature is
high, the vapourization rate is high. In winter, when the
outside temperatures are lower, the vapour pressure is
reduced. When the vapour pressure is reduced, the
vapourization rate is also reduced.

Factors Affecting Vapourization Rate: Liquid
Temperature and Level
Temperature of gas
The temperature of the liquid in the container determines
how much extra heat is needed for a specific vapourization
rate. If the liquid temperature is low, more heat is required
from the wetted surface area to bring the propane liquid to
its boiling point.
Level of liquid
As propane vapour is withdrawn, the liquid level in the tank
drops. This also means that the wetted surface area
decreases. When the wetted surface area decreases, heat
transfer to the liquid decreases, and the vapourization rate
decreases.

Factors Affecting Vapourization Rate: Relative
Humidity
As the demand for propane vapour increases, additional heat must be transferred to the liquid. In transferring heat to the
liquid, the air surrounding the wetted surface may cool.
The resulting "frost line" on the wetted surface (in high humidity) acts as an insulator, drastically reducing the vapourization
rate of the container.
If the air is very moist (high humidity), the cool air may reach its "dew point" temperature and condense on the wetted surface
of the container. If a high demand for vapour continues after the moisture has condensed on the wetted surface area, the dew
or moisture will continue to cool down rapidly. When the temperature reaches 32° F (0 °C), the moisture will freeze.
If the air is very dry (low humidity), the temperature surrounding the container can drop a great deal before any moisture or
dew condenses.

Factors Affecting
Vapourization Rate:
Location
Containers can be installed above or underground. Containers that are
installed above-ground benefit from high summer temperatures as well
as direct sunlight.
The vapourization rate of an above-ground tank or cylinder in the winter
drops because of the low outside temperatures. Underground containers
usually have constant vapourization rates all year round due to the
relatively constant temperatures underground.

Sizing a Container: Five Important Steps
Determine the total demand of all present and future appliances.
Determine the total effective load on the container.
Determine the most severe weather conditions under which the container must operate.
Determine the correct sizing table to use.
Select the proper size and number of propane containers for the application.

Step 1 - Determine Total Demand
•Size the container so that it can handle the maximum possible load that will be placed on it.
•Check the demand of all existing appliances.
•Ask the customer if any appliances will be installed in the near future.
•Locate the data or rating plate on each appliance in the system.
•Record the input rating (Btu/h) of each appliance. Be sure to include the input ratings of appliances that may be installed
later.

Step 1 - Determine Total
Demand (Continued)
If the data plate is missing, get this information by:
•a) checking with the manufacturer or distributor of the appliance for
the appliance's exact rating in Btu/h; or
•b) measuring the size of the burner orifices and determining the
rating from an orifice sizing guide.
If you still cannot determine the input rating of the appliances, use Table
4-3 as a guide to various input ratings. This table shows common
domestic, commercial, industrial, and agricultural appliances and their
respective input ratings. However, try to determine the exact rating
before referring to Table 4-3.

Step 2 - Determine Total Effective Load
The appliance input ratings shown in Table 4-3 are based on continuous operation for one full hour (Btulh). However, in many
cases, an appliance burner is controlled by a thermostat. As a result, the burner does not operate for a full hour. Instead, it
cycles on and off to satisfy the temperature setting on the thermostat.
For example, an 80 000 Btu furnace requires 32 cu ft of propane every hour to operate continuously. However, a properly sized
furnace that is installed in a well insulated home will normally cycle on and off five or six times each hour. As a result, the main
burner operates for approximately 30 minutes out of each hour.
This on and off cycling means that the supply withdrawn from the propane container is not continuous.
In order to properly size a container, you need to know what gas supply is actually required for.

Formula to Calculate Effective Load
To determine the effective (actual) load on a propane container, perform the following calculation:
Input rating × Load factor = Effective load
Where
Input rating Is that shown on the appliance rating plate
Load factor Is the actual amount of gas used, divided by the maximum amount of propane that the appliance would use if it operated continuously
Where
The right-hand column of Table 4-3 contains the average load factors for various appliances.
If the load factor for a particular application cannot be determined, use an average load factor for the relevant type of appliance or equipment. The following load
factors are "safe" average load factors for individual appliances:
•domestic 0.5
•commercial 0.5
•industrial 0.75
•agricultural 1.0
In the 80 000 Btu/h furnace example, the propane container only boils off half (30 minutes) of the vapour that it requires to operate continuously. The load factor
is therefore 0.5

Multiple Appliances: Calculating Total Effective Load
Since the propane container may be supplying gas to many appliances, all loads must be added together to find the effective load on the container.
Use the following procedure:
1.Determine the input rating for each appliance or piece of equipment.
2.Multiply the input rating of each appliance by its proper load factor (Table 4-3).
3.Add the effective loads of each of the appliances together to determine the total effective load on the container.
For example, determine the total effective load of three domestic appliances, namely:
•domestic water heater (35 000 Btu/h);
•gas range (45 000 Btu/h); and
•central heating system (80 000 Btu/h).
Input rating ×Load factor = Effective load
35 000 Btu / h ×0.16 = 5 600 Btu / h
45 000 Btu / h x 0.03 = 350 Btu / h
80 000 Btu / h ×0.50 = 40 000 Btu / h
= 46 950 Btu / h

Step 3 - Determine Weather Conditions
As stated earlier, several factors affect the vapourization rate inside the propane container. During vapour withdrawal, the two
most important factors are:
•temperature; and
•humidity.
To properly size a container for vapour withdrawal, always size the container so that it provides propane under the most
difficult weather conditions.
1.Determine the times when the container normally provides propane vapour to appliances (i.e., morning only, summer only).
2.Determine the lowest outside temperature that occurs during a normal operating period.

Step 4 - Determine Sizing
Table
The tables for sizing containers are organized according to the type and size of
container (ASME tanks, stationary DOT/TC cylinders, portable DOT/TC
cylinders, etc.). For this reason, first determine the type of container to be
used before selecting one of the tables.
There are three tables for sizing containers, all located in Appendix A:
UseFor
Table 4A-1ASME aboveground tanks
Table 4A-2ASME underground tanks
Table 4A-3DOT/TC portable cylinders,
exchange cylinders, and
stationary cylinders

Step 5 - Select Propane Gas
Containers
1.Now that the effective load, operating conditions, and sizing table
have been determined, select the proper size and number of
container(s) from the tables.
•To make the tables easier to use, the vapourization rates are not
expressed in cubic feet per hour; instead, the ratings have been
converted to Btu per hour (Btu/h).
•Additionally, the ratings indicate the vapourization rate when the
container is ready to be refilled. As a consequence, all ratings in the
tables are based on a container that is a quarter full (25% of the
container's water capacity). As long as the container is at least 25%
full, an adequate supply of gas is ensured.

Sizing Aboveground ASME Tanks
To properly size an aboveground ASME tank, follow the steps using Table 4A-1 in Appendix A of this workbook.
1.Based on the relative humidity in the area, select the applicable table:
UseFor
Table 4A-1a50-60% humidity
Table 4A-1b60-70% humidity
Table 4A-1c70-80% humidity
1.Based on the lowest temperature for the operating season of the tank, select the appropriate temperature column in the table.
2.Read down the temperature column until you locate a Btu rating that is equal to, or greater than, the effective load of the
application.
3.Read across to the Tank capacity (gallons w.c.) column to locate the required tank size.

Sizing Underground ASME Tanks
Table 4A-2 in Appendix A of this workbook, lists the vapourization rate of various ASME tanks when they are installed
underground.
Note: The temperature column only lists 50 °F. Regardless of the time of year, the earth surrounding an underground tank
usually remains around 50 °F. Note: The moisture content of the soil has been averaged out.
1.To select the proper size of an underground tank, read down the 50 °F column until you find a rating that is equal to, or
greater than, the effective load of the application.
2.Read across to the left to determine the proper size tank capacity (gallons w.c.).
If the tank is undersized, a frost line could develop on the tank and the vapourization rate will drop off to zero. If this occurs, the
tank must be dug up and a larger tank set in, resulting in a waste of time and money.
Note: Never undersize an underground tank.

Sizing DOT/TC Cylinders
Table 4A-3 in Appendix A of this workbook lists the capacities of common DOT/TC cylinders.
This table is different from the others because each cylinder has four different vapourization rates:
•two ratings for winter; and
•two ratings for summer.
Further, the summer and winter ratings are divided into low and high humidity:
AverageS
High humidity70%
Low humidity30%
Because of the low capacities of cylinders, a 10% difference in humidity or temperature does not greatly change the vapourization rate of the cylinder.
To select a DOT/TC cylinder for an application, use the following procedure:
1.Select the column in Table 4A-3 that represents the most severe weather conditions for the area (winter and high humidity, summer and low humidity, etc.)
2.Determine the type of cylinder needed (portable, replaceable, or stationary).
3.Read down the column until you locate a Btu rating that is equal to, or greater than, the effective load of the application.
4.Read straight across to the extreme left column, Cylinder Capacity, and select the cylinder required.

Propane Vapourizers
Propane vapourizers can be used when equipment or appliance demand
exceeds the natural vapourizing capacity of the tank and placing a much
larger tank, with higher vapourization capacity would not be practical.
Direct fired propane vapourizer shown in Figure 4-21, uses a flame that
directly heats the liquid propane which turns it to gas for use in
downstream, high vapour demand equipment. Liquid propane is piped
from the tank to the vapourizer where it is then heated and in turn, the
propane gas vapourization is accelerated. The vapourizer is essentially a
boiler that does not build pressure.

Container Sizing for Liquid Withdrawal
Sizing LP-gas containers for vapourizers, liquid burner applications, and stationary engines is a simple procedure. Basically, the
size of the container is based on two considerations:
•liquid withdrawal rate each day; and
•minimizing the number of gas deliveries to the customer.
In order to properly size containers for these applications, determine the daily withdrawal rate for the application. Stationary
engines are rated in the number of US gallons (litres) that they use in one continuous hour of operation (gal/hr, I/hr). To size
the container, determine the expected number of hours that the engine must operate under normal conditions.
If there are additional loads in Btu/h convert:
•effective load Btu/h divided by 91,500 = gal/hr; and
•effective load Btu/h divided by 24,174 = I/hr.
