This section provides general information about troubleshooting problems. Its purpose is to help you develop a consistent, analytical approach to troubleshooting problems.
Troubleshooting procedure
ln any troubleshooting situation, it is necessary to consider the entire system and sequence of operation including not only the burner, controls, witness such as a many of the
supply, fuel supply, fuel supply, and the condition and characteristics of the flame itself. In order to cover all areas of burner operation, the troubleshooting procedure is broken
down into a series of specific steps.

Step 1: Know the System
Study Technical
Manuals
ln other words, do your
homework. Study the
manufacturer's technical
manuals. Know how the
system works.
Stay Updated
Keep up with the latest service
bulletins. Read them and them
in a handy place. This month's
bulletin may cover the more

nandy places. The cause and
remed
Build Knowledge
Understanding the system thoroughly is the foundation of effective
troubleshooting. Familiarize yourself with all components and their
functions.

Step 2: Ask Questions and Look for Symptoms
1
Gather Information
Usually, the information available
on arrival at the installation
consists of a simple statement
such as "The burner shuts
down." Start by asking all the
installation consisted of anyone
that might have some
knowledge of what happened.
2
Ask Specific Questions
For example:
•When does the shutdown
occur?
•What part of the cycle?
•How long after the startup?
•Does a shutdown occur after
every start?
•How is the light off?
3
Observe Symptoms
These are only sample questions.
The information you need will
depend on the individual
situation situation.
Examine the equipment and look
for symptoms. A symptom is a
sign that the equipment is
operating abnormally (e.g.,
discoloration is a symptom of
excessively high heat).

Step 3: Evaluate Your Information
Consult Resources
Use the supplied manufacturer's manuals, charts, service suggestions
Apply Experience
Combine documentation with personal knowledge
Form Hypothesis
Develop initial theories about the problem
Use the supplied manufacturer's manuals, charts, service suggestions, together with your personal experience, to evaluate any
information you have concerning the problem.
The conclusions you have drawn at this stage only provide an idea of where to look for the exact solution to the problem.

Step 4: Make a Trial Run
Cycle the System
Cycle the burner system and observe.
Observe Operation
•Was each step of the startup according to the design
sequence?
•Did any deviations occur?
•Did the shutdown occur exactly as described?
•Did anything else happen?
•Have any new facts been established
Document Findings
While you perform the trial run, make a note of any new
information.

Step 5: Re-evaluate
Ongoing Assessment
You can often make the re-evaluation of
available facts during the trial run. Look
over your list of possible causes and
decide which are most likely and which
are easiest to verify.
Multiple Factors
Remember that in some instances,
more than one factor may be
contributing to the problem and you
must consider this in the solution.
Prioritize Solutions
Reach your decision on the leading
causes and plan to check them first.

Steps 6-7: Test and Correct
Step 6: Test Your Conclusions
After determining the apparent cause(s) of the appliance
problem, perform a second test run to Aller dotomining the
uppers. If you have not found the answer, you must make a
new See if the ovaluation is on our information that you have
obtained during the second test run. More than one re-
evaluation test may be necessary to get all the information
you need to positively identify the cause(s) of the problem.
Step 7: Correct the Condition(s)
At this stage, you would be confident in adjusting or
replacing the faulty part(s). (Note that you At this Stuge,
you would be connect with the manufacturer's manual.) Do
a final run-through cannot adjust all parts in the first -
solerent parts, make sure that you provide the model
number of the equipment.

Mechanical Drawings and
Specifications
Mechanical drawings are essential tools in the gas industry, serving as
"maps" that guide technicians in understanding where to install
appliances and connect gas piping. Gas technicians and fitters must
develop a strong understanding of how to interpret these important
drawings and the symbols used in them to perform their work effectively.

Purpose of Mechanical Drawings
Essential Tools
Mechanical drawings serve as necessary tools in the gas industry,
providing detailed information about installation locations and
connection points.
Technical Guidance
These drawings act as "maps" that guide technicians in understanding
exactly where to install appliances and where to connect gas piping.

Understanding terminology is essential for correctly interpreting
mechanical drawings and specifications in the gas industry.

Basic Drawing Views
Three-Dimensional
Representation
Buildings are three-
dimensional objects, making it
impossible for a single view to
show an entire building and all
necessary details.
Multiple Perspectives
A set of construction drawings
typically includes various
views showing the building
from different angles to
provide complete information.
Comprehensive Understanding
Different views work together to convey all the construction
information needed for proper installation and connection.

Pictorial Drawings
Easy Comprehension
Pictorial or perspective drawings are easy to understand
because they show an object as it appears in real life.
Like photographs, pictorials show the length, width, and
height of objects in a single view, giving viewers a quick
mental image of an object.
Pictorial drawings are like photographs, showing the object
as it appears. They're particularly useful for inexperienced
readers of construction prints.

Uses of Pictorial Drawings
Architectural Visualization
Architects often use pictorial drawings to show project owners how the final building will look.
Quick Comprehension
Viewers can quickly understand the object's appearance, even if they are inexperienced in reading construction prints.
Three-Dimensional View
Shows length, width, and height of objects in a single view, similar to a photograph.

Orthographic Projections
Precise Information
While pictorial drawings give a quick mental image, they
aren't ideal for conveying precise information about size and
shape.
In pictorial drawings, parts of the object are distorted to
create a three-dimensional look, which can affect accuracy.
Two-Dimensional Views
Orthographic projection shows separate but related two-
dimensional views of an object on a single piece of paper.
This method provides the precise information needed to
fabricate the object without distortion.

The Glass Box Concept
Imagine an Object in a Glass Box
The best way to understand orthographic projection is to imagine an
object floating inside a glass box.
Draw Views on Each Side
Looking at right angles through each side of the box, you would
draw the view of the object on the glass.
Create Plane Views
Each view through the glass shows only one plane of the
object, with all lines straight and parallel.

Orthographic View Representation
Each side of the glass box shows only one plane of the object
and all lines are straight and parallel.
Square Views
Each view represents what you would see when looking at the
object squarely from that direction.
This method eliminates distortion and provides accurate
dimensions for each plane of the object.

Opening the Glass Box
Unfolding the Views
If you were to open the imaginary glass box, each view would
be in the correct position for a true orthographic drawing.
Each view has a name that reflects its position in relation to
the other views.
Opening up the imaginary glass box places each view in the
correct position for a true orthographic drawing.

Flattening the Glass Box
Flatten the Box
The next step is to flatten out the
imaginary box to create a two-
dimensional representation.
Remove the Box
Finally, remove the box completely to
leave only the views of the object.
Create Standard Projection
The result is a standard six-view
orthographic projection showing all
sides of the object.

Six-View Orthographic Projection
Complete Representation
A standard six-view orthographic projection shows the
front, back, top, bottom, left side, and right side of an object.
This comprehensive set of views provides complete
information about the object's dimensions and features
from every angle.
Standard six-view orthographic projection showing all sides
of an object in a flattened arrangement.

Practical Orthographic Projections
Simplified Views
In most cases, it is not necessary to show all six sides of an
object.
Most orthographic projections show only the front, top, and
right-side views.
Essential Information
Designers generally include only as many views as needed to
convey the information required to fabricate the object.

Orthographic Projections in Appliance
Specifications
Practical Applications
One common use of orthographic projection in
manufacturer's instructions is to show the dimensions and
optional layouts for appliances or components.

showing dimensions and layout options.

Isometric Drawings
Combining Approaches
An isometric drawing is like a pictorial or perspective
drawing, except that its front view is flat like the front view
of an orthographic projection.
The receding view is at a 30° angle, creating a three-
dimensional appearance while maintaining more accurate
proportions.

Detail and Assembly Drawings
Component Visualization
A detail or assembly drawing is a detailed drawing of the components and hardware of an
appliance.
These drawings are particularly useful when you need to disassemble, assemble, or repair an
appliance on the job site.
Typical detail and assembly drawing showing components like gaskets, brackets, and blower
parts.

Detail Drawing
Characteristics
Focused Scope
As the name implies, a detail
drawing shows a small part of
the entire project in great
detail.
Larger Scale
Often, a larger scale is used to
include more detailed
information in the drawing.
Component Clarity
Detail drawings provide clear information about specific parts,
making them invaluable for repair and maintenance work.

Piping Drawings
Representation Types
Piping drawings can be orthographic or isometric, depending
on the level of detail and perspective needed.
The typical isometric drawing displays all the important pieces
in symbol form like a schematic.
Piping drawings use standardized symbols to represent valves,
fittings, and other components in a clear, consistent manner.

Mechanical Drawings
Purpose
The purpose of mechanical
drawings is to illustrate the
mechanical systems in a
building.
Creation Timeline
They are drawn during the
design of the building and
reviewed during
construction.
Content
Typically includes building address, location of mechanical
equipment, ventilation systems, electric panel locations,
ductwork location, and sizes.

Schematic Diagrams
Function Over Form
The schematic diagram facilitates the tracing of hydraulic, pneumatic, or electrical lines and the
components of each.
It shows the relationship between the various parts of a system, not the actual size, shape, or
location of the components or devices.
A schematic diagram of a circuit showing electrical components without regard to their physical
location.

Schematic Diagram Focus
Connections
Schematics show how
components connect to each
other within a system.
Functions
They illustrate the functional
relationship between
components rather than their
physical arrangement.
Flow
Schematics demonstrate how energy, signals, or materials flow
through the system.

Wiring Diagrams
Physical Representation
Unlike schematic diagrams, wiring diagrams show how and
where the wires are connected and how they run between
devices.
Wiring diagrams are very useful for the initial wiring of a circuit
and for tracing wires when troubleshooting.
Wiring diagram of an electrical circuit showing the physical
arrangement of connections.

Wiring Diagram
Conventions
Solid Lines
Solid lines typically
represent conductors that
the manufacturer has wired
in the factory.
Broken or Dotted
Lines
Broken or dotted lines
represent wiring that will be
applied in the field by the
technician.
Common Placement
Wiring diagrams are commonly found on the rear panel covers of
major gas and propane appliances.

Wiring Diagram Schedules
Definition
Wiring diagrams often come with a schedule, which is usually a table that
lists important details.
Color Information
Schedules typically include color codes for different wires in the system.
Terminal Locations
They provide information about where wires connect to terminals in the
system.
Voltage Specifications
Schedules list the expected voltage at various points in the circuit.

Lines and Symbols
Visual Language
Lines and symbols are the language of the draftsperson.
In gas or hydronic systems, they help visually represent pipes, fittings, valves, and components.
System Visualization
When drawn together in their respective positions, they clearly illustrate a piping system and explain a great deal of how
it operates.

Line Types and Meanings
Information Precision
Lines on technical drawings provide exact information concerning the
shape of an object and how it is connected to other objects and various
circuits.
A variety of lines help convey different meanings, with Canadian
standards defining line thickness as thick or thin.
Thick lines are at least twice as thick as thin lines, creating visual
hierarchy in the drawing.

Common Line Types
Line TypeDescription
Object lineThick lines that trace the visible outline
of an object
Hidden lineThin, equally spaced, broken lines that
show surfaces and features hidden in
the chosen views
CentrelineThin, broken lines, with long and short
lines spaced alternately that indicate
the exact centre of an object
Extension lineThin lines that do not touch the object
lines and extend them out for
dimensioning
Dimension lineThin lines with arrowheads that touch
extension lines, giving measured
dimensions

Piping Symbols and Lines
Standardized Shorthand
Symbols are the shorthand signs used on drawings. They are
for the most part international, but some countries have
different symbols.
Organizations like ISO, CSA Group, and ANSI publish tables
of symbols for welding, piping, surface texture, and
electrical elements.
Common piping fitting symbols used in mechanical
drawings.

Common Fitting Symbols
Piping installation plans contain special lines to distinguish various types of pipes, with different symbols representing elbows,
tees, wyes, crosses, caps, plugs, and reducing couplings in both single-line and double-line formats.

Specifications
Variable Scope
A specification normally accompanies the construction
prints and can vary considerably in length depending on the
size and complexity of the project.
On smaller jobs, the specifications or "specs" may consist
simply of a list of materials written on the same page as the
drawings.
Comprehensive Documentation
On large projects, the specifications are printed in book or
manual form, often spanning several hundred pages.
These comprehensive specs cover every aspect of the job
from the initial bidding process to the final payment.

Precedence of Specifications
Contractual Importance
The specification is an integral part of the contract documents and is generally
considered the most important document after the actual written agreement.
Conflict Resolution
If there is any disagreement between the specification and a drawing, the
information in the specification is usually taken to be correct.
Final Decisions
The reason is that specifications usually come last in preparation and reflect final
decisions.
Legal Weight
Written instructions also carry more weight in a court of law.

Handling Discrepancies
Identify the Issue
Recognize when there is a discrepancy between specifications and
drawings.
Report to Architect
If a discrepancy is found, it should be reported to the architect.
Seek Confirmation
The architect should confirm the correct information to
resolve the discrepancy.
Document Resolution
Ensure the resolution is documented for future reference.

The Scale
Importance
The scale is very important, although it does not occupy its
own block on drawings.
It makes it possible to describe details of large and small
machines or components on standard sized paper.
Determining Factors
The size and complexity of the machine determine the scale
used in the drawing.
The first figure of a scale designation refers to the
dimensions used to draw the object, while the second
number refers to the actual size of the object.

Scale Types
Scale TypeRatio ExampleDescription
Actual scale1:1Drawing is actual size
Reduced scale1:10One unit on the print

Revision Block
Placement
The revision block may be
placed either in the lower left-
or upper right-hand corner of
the print.
Purpose
The purpose of this block is to
list any and all revisions made
to the drawing after the initial
drafting of the print.
Change Tracking
This ensures that all modifications to the original design are
documented and traceable.

Materials Block
Location and Purpose
The materials block is generally found just above the title
block.
It may also be called the bill of materials and provides a
complete list of parts for that print or page.

enlarged scales help show fine details that would be difficult to see at actual size.

Specification Importance by Project Size
Specification PagesRelative Importance
As project size increases, both the length of specifications and their relative importance in the contract documents grow significantly. For large projects, specifications often become the definitive
reference for resolving any discrepancies or questions during construction.

Common Piping Symbols
Piping symbols provide a standardized way to represent various fittings and components in piping systems. These symbols are used consistently across
drawings to ensure clear communication between designers, engineers, and installers. Understanding these symbols is essential for gas technicians to

Graphs and Charts
Graphs and charts are what you use to represent facts, statistics, or the relationship between physical properties. A visual or
graphical description is often easier to understand than a numerical or verbal description. The gas technician/fitter must know
how to read and correctly interpret the many types of graphs and charts in the gas industry.
Objectives
At the end of this Chapter, you will be able to:
•identify types of graphs and charts; and
•locate data on graphs.

Types of Graphs and Charts
A graph or chart is a line or diagram showing how one quantity depends
on, changes, or relates with, another. Graphs and charts represent facts,
statistics, or the relationship between physical properties. A visual or
graphical description is often easier to understand than a numerical or
verbal description.

Applications of Graphs and
Charts

Bar Graphs
Bar graphs are visual representations of numerical values by bars or columns of
different lengths. The bars, which may be vertical or horizontal, begin at a baseline
and indicate the relationship between two or more related variables. In Figure 4-1, the
two variables are temperature in "F and resistance in ohms for a resistance
temperature detector (RTD).
Present Information to Non-Technical Audience
Easy to understand for all viewers
Represent Small Numbers of Plotted Values
Works well with limited data points
Simple Comparison of Two Values
Clear visual comparison along two axes
Represent Data for a Total Period
Shows data relative to point data

Disadvantages of Bar Charts
While bar charts are effective for many purposes, they do have limitations that make them
less suitable for certain applications.
Not Suitable For:
•Comparing several series of data
•Plotting large numbers of values
When dealing with multiple data series or large datasets, other chart types may provide
better visualization and clarity.

Pie Charts
You use pie charts to compare individual parts in relation to their total by
representing them as sectors of a circular area. Its common uses are the
following:
Visually Present Data on a Percentage Basis
Shows proportional relationships clearly
Present a General Overall View
Provides quick understanding of information
Show Relationship Between Small Number of Values
Works best with limited data points
Emphasize Amount of Data Rather Than Trend
Focuses on proportions rather than changes over time

X-Y Graphs
X-Y graphs have the values of two related variables plotted as points on a coordinates grid. The points are then joined together
successively to form a continuous line or curve.
Compare Large Numbers of
Values
Can display many data points in a
compact space
Compare Trends of Several
Curves
Multiple data series can be shown
on one graph
Calculate Intermediate
Values
Values that fall between plotted
points can be determined

Reading X-Y Graphs
On X-Y graphs, you see the values of the two variables plotted with reference to two axes that are perpendicular to one
another, meeting at a common origin or zero point.
The curve on the X-Y graph in Figure 4-3 represents the relationship between flue gas temperature and the operating time of a
burner. The x-axis is the time of burner operation in minutes and the y-axis is the flue gas temperature in degrees Celsius.
The five lines labelled A, B, C, D, and E on the X-Y graph in Figure 4-4 represent the relationship between outside air
temperature (x-axis) and the operating time (y-axis) of each of five different building's heating systems.

Disadvantages of X-Y Graphs
Despite their versatility, X-Y graphs have certain limitations that make them less suitable
for specific applications.
Generally Unsuitable For:
•Representing small numbers of plotted values in a series
•Showing changes or differences in absolute amounts
•Showing extreme or irregular movements of data
In these cases, other chart types may provide better clarity and visual representation of
the data.

Flow Charts
A flow chart is generally a schematic representation of a process flow, showing the information in several ways, including:
•schematic symbols;
•labelled blocks; and
•combinations of all three.
The flow chart in Figure 4-5 shows the water circulation flow-path through a hot-water heating system. In Figure 4-5, the arrowheads
indicate the direction of water flow through the system, schematic symbols represent the valves, and the boiler and radiator are in pictorial
form.

Locating Data on Graphs
The X-Y chart in Figure 4-6 is what you use to determine the correct termination height for a vent on roofs with a pitch greater than 9/12.
You can see the roof pitch values along the x-axis, and the minimum allowable vertical distance from the roof surface to the lowest opening
in the top along the y-axis.
Identify the Variables
Understand what each axis represents and
the units of measurement
Locate the Point of Interest
Find where your specific values intersect on
the graph
Read the Corresponding Value
Trace to the appropriate axis to determine
the result

Using Charts to Determine Vent Termination Height
Determine the Pitch of the Roof
Find this value on the x-axis
Locate the Point on the Diagonal Line
Trace a line from the roof pitch value vertically up the y-axis
Trace the Horizontal Line
Follow the horizontal line nearest the point where the roof pitch value crosses the diagonal line back to the distance scale along the y-axis
Read the Corresponding Value
This indicates the minimum allowable vertical distance between the vent or chimney discharge and the nearest obstruction or opening

Practical Application of Vent Termination Charts
Reading the Chart
The chart provides a visual guide for determining the correct
height for vent termination based on roof pitch. By following
the steps outlined in the previous section, gas technicians can
ensure proper installation that meets safety standards.
Importance of Accuracy
Precise measurement and correct interpretation of these
charts is essential for proper venting, which affects both the
efficiency of gas appliances and the safety of the installation.
Always verify measurements and consult local codes for
specific requirements.

Units of Measurement and
Conversion Factors
A gas technician/fitter needs to know both the traditional Units of
measurement and the SI (metric) Units of measurement in technical
manuals, specifications, drawings, and graphs. Installing and servicing
the gas equipment in accordance with specifications requires prior
understanding of the Units of measurement.

Purpose of Understanding
Measurement Units
Technical
Documentation
Gas technicians must interpret
technical manuals and
specifications that use various
measurement units.
Equipment Installation
Proper installation of gas
equipment requires
understanding specifications
in both imperial and metric
units.
Service and Maintenance
Servicing gas equipment according to specifications requires
knowledge of measurement units.

Learning Objectives

International System of Units (SI)
Development of SI Units
Countries that participate in the activities of the General
Conference of Weights and Measures (CGPM), the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and
the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have
developed and approved the International System of Units
(SI), a rationalized, coherent, simplified metric-based
system of measurement.
Canadian Participation
Canada is a member of all these organizations.
However, many Units of measurement that the gas industry
uses are still in imperial Units of measurement.

Understanding
Measurement Prefixes
The use of prefixes indicates the order of magnitude of the quantity
noted. Thus, the prefix 'k' used with the symbol 'W' for watts, indicates
1000 watts or a kilowatt. The prefix 'M' used with the symbol J for joule
indicates 1,000,000 joules or a megajoule (MJ).
Table 5-1 lists the prefixes that a gas technician/fitter typically
encounters.

Common Measurement Prefixes
SymbolNameMultiplying factor
Ggiga1 000 000 000 = 109
Mmega1 000 000 = 106
kkilo1,000 = 103
ddeci0.1 = 10-1
ccenti0.01 = 10-2
mmilli0.001 = 10-3

Special Note on "M" in
Imperial Measurements
Sometimes in imperial measurement, "M" represents a multiplying
factor of 1,000 = 103 (e.g., MBtu/h = 1,000s of Btu/h).
This is an important distinction to remember when working with both
imperial and SI units, as the same prefix can have different meanings
depending on the measurement system being used.
