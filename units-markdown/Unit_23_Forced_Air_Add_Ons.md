Indoor air quality is a critical consideration for health and comfort. The EPA estimates that
indoor air can be 2-5 times more polluted than outdoor air, making effective filtration an
essential component of a healthy home environment.

Filter Efficiency vs. Airflow Balance
Filtration Efficiency (%)Airflow Restriction (%)
This chart illustrates the relationship between filter efficiency (MERV rating) and airflow restriction. As filter efficiency increases, so does the resistance to airflow. Finding the right balance is
crucial for system performance and air quality.

Air Filter Environmental Impact
Disposable Filters
Disposable filters contribute to landfill
waste, with millions discarded
annually. The environmental impact
includes:
•Manufacturing resources (paper,
cardboard, synthetic materials)
•Transportation emissions
•Landfill space
•Non-biodegradable components
Reusable Filters
Reusable filters offer environmental
benefits but have their own
considerations:
•Reduced waste generation
•Water and detergent usage for
cleaning
•Energy for manufacturing durable
materials
•Longer lifespan (typically 3-5
years)
Energy Considerations
The energy efficiency impact of filters
is also important:
•Clean filters reduce HVAC energy
consumption
•Proper filtration extends
equipment life
•Balanced approach saves
resources long-term

Electrostatic Filter Installation
Installation Locations
Because electrostatic filters are a form of slab filter, they are installed in the same
position and way as slab filters, either:
•inside the plenum; or
•in a filter frame.
Consult the manufacturer's specifications for installation instructions.
Proper installation of electrostatic filters is essential for optimal performance. Always
follow manufacturer guidelines for specific installation requirements and clearances.

Electrostatic Filter Cleaning Instructions
Vacuuming
If the filter is lightly soiled,
vacuuming will be sufficient to
remove the particles.
Vacuum first the upstream side
of the filter, followed by the
downstream side. You can also
vacuum some electrostatic
filters in place.
Consult the manufacturer's
instructions for specifics.
Flushing with clean water
From time-to-time, flush the
filter thoroughly with clean water
using either a hose or shower
nozzle.
Drying the filter before returning
it to position is not necessary,
but you should shake excess
water from it to prevent it from
dripping into the ductwork.
Washing with detergent
If the filter is greasy, wash it with
detergent, possibly in a bathtub.
However, take care not to
scratch the tub with the filter
frame.
Rinse the filter with clear water
before you return it.

Electrostatic Filter
Maintenance
Regular Inspection
The gas technician/fitter
should inspect the
electrostatic air filter during
the inspection of the furnace
and replace damaged filters.
Customer Education
Ensure customers understand
the cleaning requirements and
maintenance schedule for
their electrostatic air filter.
Performance Monitoring
Check filter efficiency periodically to ensure it continues to provide
adequate air filtration for the system.

Electronic Air Cleaners Overview
What Are EACs?
An electronic air cleaner (EAC) may be free-standing or designed to be installed into
central heating and cooling systems. The basic operation is the same. In this chapter,
references to EACs are those designed to be installed into the heating and cooling
system.
Electronic air cleaners use an electrostatic charge to capture airborne particles,
providing efficient filtration for residential HVAC systems.

Electronic Air Cleaner Components
Pre-filter
The pre-filter screens large particles
before they enter the electrostatic
field. This section may be composed
of fine wire mesh, expanded
aluminum, or foam.
The large particles removed by the
pre-filter might cause excessive
arcing (and excess ozone production)
if they could enter the high-voltage
section of the air cleaner cell. Note:
The pre-filter serves the same
purpose as the slab or hammock
filters in the furnace blower
compartment, so when an EAC is
installed, remove any existing slab or
hammock filter.
Charging Section
The charging section (cell) consists of
a band of small-diameter wire
filaments or ionizer wires.
They are supplied with high DC
voltage (between 6 and 25 kV DC)
from the power pack. The wires are
suspended equidistant between
grounded plates. The high voltage on
the wires creates an electrostatic
field, also called an ionizing field.
The positive ions create flow across
the airstream. As airborne particles
pass through the field, they become
positively or negatively charged.
Collecting Section
The collector cell contains a series of
parallel plates.
Alternate plates are charged with a
positive direct current voltage of 4 to
10 kV DC. Plates that are not charged
are at ground potential. The charged
particles passing into this section are
attracted to the plates by the electric
field on the charges they carry. These
capture and hold contaminated
particles of the opposite charge.
Oils or adhesives on the plates may
augment retention.
Power Pack
The power pack consists of: a step-up
transformer, which increases
incoming 120 V AC current to 3000 -
3500 V at the collector cells; and a
rectifier circuit (also called a voltage
doubler), which converts the
previously mentioned current to 7500
-- 8500 V DC at the charging cells.

EAC Control Systems
System Switch
The air cleaner comes with a
manual system switch.
Air Proving Switch
The air proving switch ensures
that the EAC is functioning
only when the furnace blower
is in operation.
Indicator Lights
Many EACs include indicator lights to show when the unit is
operating and when maintenance is required.

EAC Advantages and Disadvantages
Advantages
•Unchanging system resistance as particles are collected
•Removal of fine particulate matter, such as cigarette
smoke and pollen
•Collection of particles does not impair system operation
•Highly efficient on 5 and and differen
Disadvantages
•Removal of odours of vapours such as tobacco smoke are
not removed (To reduce these odours, you may add an
activated carbon filter downstream of the EAC to filter
out odours)
•High initial cost
•Production of ozone gas with a noticeable odour created
by an electrical arc
•More complicated customer-performed maintenance
and cleaning than for media filters
As a result of some of these disadvantages, EACs are not as popular today as they once were. EACs produce ozone levels in the
house air but not greater than the safe concentrations recommended by health guidelines.

EAC Installation Locations
Return Air Plenum
EACs are typically installed in the return air plenum.
Near Blower Compartment
They may be installed in the return air duct close to the blower compartment.
Between Components
They may be installed between the plenum and the blower.
Additional Locations
You can also install air cleaners in the outdoor-air intake ducts of buildings
and residences or in the recirculation and bypass air ducts.
Always place air cleaners ahead of heating or cooling coils and other air-conditioning
equipment in the system to protect other equipment from dust and to increase its
efficiency.

Sheet Metal Modifications for EAC
Installation
Gradual Transitions
If the duct is a different size from the air cleaner cabinet, gradual transitions
are recommended to reduce air turbulence and increase efficiency.
Expansion Limits
The expansion should be no more than 20 degrees, or 4 inches per running ft
(100 mm per 300 linear mm) on each side.
Air Distribution
In the duct adjacent to the unit, install turning vanes to ensure good air
distribution across the face of the electronic cells.
System Benefits
This will help to keep the blower and evaporator coil clean and ensure the unit
functions efficiently.

EAC Installation Requirements
Complete Filtration
EACs must filter the entire return air stream.
Proper Air Flow
EACs must not exceed acceptable restrictions to air flow.
Adequate Clearance
EACs must be installed with clearances that match
manufacturer's specifications and allow for service
access. If necessary, a duct offset can be used to provide
space for an EAC.
Humidifier Considerations
EACs should be installed upstream from the humidifier, if
possible. Moisture from the humidifier will cause mineral
and salt buildup in the EAC. If the EAC must be installed
downstream from the humidifier, the distance between
the two units should be as great as possible.

Duct Offset for EAC
Installation
Measure Required Space
Determine the dimensions needed for the EAC installation.
Create Offset Design
Design the duct offset to accommodate the EAC while maintaining
proper airflow.
Fabricate Transition Pieces
Create the necessary ductwork components for the offset
installation.
Install Offset and EAC
Mount the offset ductwork and install the EAC according to
manufacturer specifications.

EAC Installation Step 1:
Preparation
Clean Blower Compartment
Remove as much dust as possible from the heating system before installing the
EAC.
Remove Furnace Filter
Remove and discard the furnace filter.
Vacuum Ductwork
Power vacuum the ductwork to remove accumulated dust in an existing home,
or construction dust in a new home.
Clean Fan Blades
Clean the furnace fan blades as required. Since the EAC removes particles only
from circulating air, it cannot remove dust that has settled in the blower
compartment or distribution ducts.

EAC Installation Step 2: Attach Cabinet to Furnace
Remove Components
Remove and set aside the access door, electronic cell(s), and pre-filters.
Note: Electronic cells and ionizing wires are very delicate. You must handle them with caution. The power door requires accurate and secure
replacement.
Align Cabinet
Align the cabinet with the return air opening.
Create Opening
Create an opening in the furnace to match air cleaner cabinet opening.
Install Transition
Install a transition when furnace and air cleaner openings are different sizes.
Level and Support
Be sure the unit is firmly supported and level. Place blocks under the cabinet if necessary.
Secure Cabinet
Attach the cabinet securely to the furnace. Either attach the cabinet directly or use a starting collar fitted in the furnace opening. Either drill holes
and fasten with sheet metal screws or rivets, or use slip joints.

EAC Installation Step 3: Install
Turning Vanes
When To Install
Install turning vanes if the EAC must be located close to a turn in the ductwork.
Purpose
The vanes ensure even air flow over the face of the unit.
Installation Method
Follow manufacturer guidelines for proper installation of turning vanes to optimize
airflow.
Performance Impact
Properly installed turning vanes improve EAC efficiency and reduce system
resistance.

EAC Installation Steps 4-5: Ductwork and Wiring
Step 4: Fasten Cabinet to Ductwork
Install a transition when the opening on the air cleaner and the opening on
the duct are different sizes.
Step 5: Wiring
EACs function only when the blower is operating and air is in motion. When
properly installed, the EAC electrically or mechanically interlocks with the
furnace or cooling system blower circuit and can only operate when the
furnace blower is energized.
For an interlock:
1.Install a sail switch in the return air duct. When the blower is energized,
the air movement causes a fin on the sail switch to move, closing a set
of electrical contacts to the EAC and energizing it.
2.Follow all electrical and building codes in conjunction with
manufactures instructions.

Ozone Production in EACs
Normal Operation
A properly functioning EAC produces a small amount of ozone, the odour of which may be
noticeable. The gas technician/fitter should explain this odour to the building occupants.
Excessive Ozone
A strong noticeable odour indicates continuous arcing and brush discharge in the EAC and
indicates a need for service.
Odor Reduction
An activated carbon filter can reduce the odour of ozone. Install the activated carbon
downstream from the air cleaner.
Safety Note
Since some activated charcoal filters are combustible, it is important that particles from the air
filter are not able to fall into the EAC.
Note: High ozone odours can occur if there is too little air flow through the filter.

Customer Instructions for EAC
Maintenance
Cleaning Frequency
EACs require cleaning every one to six months, depending on household
conditions.
Household Factors
A home with several people and pets, where residents smoke tobacco, and have
hobbies such as woodworking, will need frequent EAC cleaning.
Lower Maintenance Homes
A smaller household with no smokers, pets, or individuals with dusty hobbies, will
need less frequent EAC cleaning.
Professional Service
Since cleaning must be frequent, while other services are rarer, the customer
must know how to clean the EAC. Some customers may also be happy to replace
broken ionizing wires themselves. A trained gas technician/fitter should do all
other servicing.

Technician Responsibilities for Customer Education
Show Power Switch
The gas technician/fitter must show the customer the
location of the power switch (and test switch, if the EAC
includes one).
Demonstrate Cleaning
The gas technician/fitter must ensure that the customer
knows how to remove and clean filters and cells, according to
the manufacturer's instructions for the unit.
Explain Maintenance Schedule
Most EACs come with a wash reminder schedule, which
should be posted in a convenient place for customer
reference.
Explain Indicator Lights
Some EACs have an indicator light that comes on to indicate
that the cells are dirty and air cleaning efficiency is
diminished. Ideally, the cells should be washed frequently
enough that this light never comes on.
Caution! Turn off the power to the EAC before cleaning the cells to discharge the electronic cells. Sometimes, it takes a few minutes for the
charge on the cells to dissipate. Pressing the test button after the unit is turned off will dissipate the charge to ground.

Cleaning EAC Cells: Basic Procedure
Remove Cells
Slide cells out of cabinet. Be careful as cells may have sharp edges.
Wash Cells
Wash the cells either by soaking them at a coin-operated do-it-yourself car wash or in an automatic dishwasher. Take care not to damage the ionizing wires, no matter which method is
used. Detergent is usually used for cleaning. Follow the manufacturer's specific instructions for cleaning materials.
Inspect Cells
After washing, inspect the cells for dirt or residue. Repeat the washing process if necessary.
Clean Pre-filter
Before reassembling the EAC, clean the pre-filter. You may wash the pre-filter screen with detergent, or you may vacuum them, whichever is more convenient. Do not wash the
pre-filter in the dishwasher or a car wash. Since the pre-filter contains lint that can become caught in cells, do not soak it at the same time as the cells.
Inspect Wires
Before reassembling the EAC inspect the ionizing wires and replace any that are broken.
Reassemble
Reassemble the EAC. If the EAC has a drying unit, engage it.
Restore Power
Turn power on at main disconnect.
Note: Some EACs will not operate until they are completely dry. Others will operate, but wet cells and pre-filters may cause arcing. If the unit comes with a Check LED, the light may come on
when cells and pre-filters are wet in the unit. Wait for two or three hours until the cells and pre-filter are completely dry to avoid these problems.

Dishwasher Method for Cleaning EAC Cells
Check Compatibility
Before washing the cells in the dishwasher, check the dishwasher manual. Some manufacturers of dishwashers do not recommend using them to wash electronic cells.
Position Cells
Place cells on the bottom rack with the air flow arrows pointing up, being sure to place in such a way as to allow good water circulation. Do not place anything else in the dishwasher with the cells.
Add Detergent
Use regular dishwashing detergent.
Run Wash Cycle
Run them through a complete wash cycle. Do not allow the dishwasher to run through the dry cycle. The dry cycle will bake on any contaminants that remain on the cells and impair air cleaner
efficiency.
Cool and Drain
Allow the cells to cool completely in the dishwasher or wear protective gloves to avoid burns when removing the cells. Hot water may accumulate in the tubs supporting the collector plates. Tip the
cells to drain these tubes.
Clean Wires
Wipe the ionizer wires and contact board on the end of the cell gently using a small damp cloth.
Clean Dishwasher
If dirt or residue remains in the dishwasher, run the dishwasher again, empty, to clean it.

Soaking Method for Cleaning EAC Cells
Prepare Container
Do not soak cells in a bathtub since their sharp edges can scratch the tub finish. Fill a container large enough to immerse one or both cells with
very hot water.
Add Detergent
Dissolve 3/4 cup of regular automatic dishwashing detergent per cell. If the detergent does not dissolve readily or forms a scum on the water,
use softened water or try another brand.
Soak Cells
After the detergent is completely dissolved, lower the cell(s) into the container and soak each cell for 15 - 20 minutes.
Agitate and Remove
Lift the cells up and down a few times, then remove them.
Rinse and Soak Again
Rinse the cells with a fine spray and soak again in hot clean water for 5 - 15 minutes.
Drain
Stand the cells upright to drain.

Checking and Replacing Ionization Wires
Inspect Wires
The fine tungsten wires in the charging section of the electronic cell are brittle and can easily break or become damaged. Show the customer how to inspect the cell from the upstream side to ensure no wires are broken or out of position.
Identify Issues
Broken wires can cause visible arcing or sparking. They require replacement.
Replacement Parts
Replacement wires are supplied cut to length with eyelets on both ends for installation. Some customers may prefer to have the gas technician/fitter replace ionizing wires rather than doing it themselves.
Replacement Procedure
Remove the broken wire. Be careful not to damage the spring connector. Be sure all parts of the wire are removed. Hook the eyelet of the new ionization wire over the spring connector on one end of the cell. Hold the opposite eyelet with needlenose pliers and
stretch the wire the length of the cell. Depress the opposite spring connector and hook the eyelet over it.
Note: Take caution when working on EACs; always ensure the power supply is off.

EAC Maintenance and Service
Customer Maintenance
The customer can clean cells and replacement ionizing wires, but a trained gas
technician/fitter must perform other maintenance and service.
Basic Maintenance
Before the beginning of the heating and cooling seasons, inspect the solid-state
components and ionizing wires of the EAC. The exact procedure for checking the unit will
vary depending on the manufacturer, so refer to the manufacturer's instructions.
Component Checks
Checking the components at the beginning of the heating and cooling seasons is basic
preventive maintenance for the EAC. Checking the components requires a voltmeter or
multimeter.
Professional Service
Regular professional maintenance ensures optimal performance and extends the life of the
EAC.

Checking EAC Components
Power Check
Be sure the power from the main disconnect to the EAC is in the ON position.
Sail Switch Test
To check the operation of the sail switch (or electrical blower interlock), energize the furnace blower. If the EAC does not operate, the sail switch may be faulty.
Indicator Light Check
Check to see that the voltage indicator light is on. If the light is not on, but the unit operates, the light is faulty.
Test Button Check
Push the Test Button on the front of the EAC access door. Pushing the button shorts the hot side of the collector section to ground and should produce one or more loud
snapping sounds in the section. This indicates that the EAC is working properly. The test button discharges the cells.
Power Pack Voltage Check
Remove the access door. With the voltmeter or multimeter set to AC, check the voltage to the power pack. It should read 120 V AC. If the power pack is not working, you
can replace the solid-state power supply within the power supply box.
Collecting Section Voltage Check
With the voltmeter or multimeter set to DC, check the voltage to the collecting section plates (3000 - 3500 V DC).
Charging Section Voltage Check
With the voltmeter or multimeter set to DC, check the voltage to charging ionization wires. It should read 7500 - 8500 V DC.
Caution! EACs operate at high voltage to charge particles. Follow manufacturer's instructions carefully when servicing them to avoid a hazard.

EAC Troubleshooting
IfThen
There is visible arcing or sparking.Check the cell for short circuits using
an ohmmeter. Make sure power to the
EAC is off and cells are discharged.
Check the resistance between the
frame of the cell and the ionizer, and
the frame of the cell and the collector
contacts. In each case, the resistance
should be infinite.
A cell is sparking continuously in one
place.
The plates need to be repositioned.
Consult the manufacturer's
instructions for correct positioning of
plates.
The customer complains of an ozone
odour.
Make sure the air cleaner shuts off
when the furnace blower is not active.
Make sure there is adequate air flow
through the unit.

UV Air Purifiers Introduction
What is UV Light?
Ultraviolet (UV) light rays lie in the spectrum of light that is
invisible to most humans. UV lights are designed to create a
specific wavelength range within the electromagnetic spectrum
of UV radiation.
The following are the common UV lamps used in air purification
systems:
•The UVC range is germicidal and is therefore commonly used
for air sterilization UVC lamps effectively destroy
microorganisms that pass by the bulb, including germs,
viruses, bacteria, and fungi (such as mould).
•Vacuum UV (VUV) lights can help reduce gaseous
contaminants and odours such as volatile organic
compounds (VOC).
•UVA combined with a catalyst reduce odours and chemicals.
UVC light is like looking at the sun. Looking at the blue light can
result in significant eye damage and exposure to it can result in
skin damage.
Ensure no plastic parts or wire insulation are exposed to UV light.

UV Light Spectrum
UVA (315-400 nm)
When combined with a catalyst, UVA light can help reduce odors and chemicals
in the air.
UVB (280-315 nm)
This range has limited applications in air purification systems.
UVC (200-280 nm)
The germicidal range that effectively destroys microorganisms including germs,
viruses, bacteria, and fungi.
Vacuum UV (100-200 nm)
Can help reduce gaseous contaminants and odors such as volatile organic
compounds (VOCs).

Germicidal UV Lamp
Basic Function
The basic UVC lamp device is designed to fit into a wide variety of locations in
the supply or return air duct. Installing the device near the cooling coil to
reduce mould and bacteria in the coil fins, drain pans, and surrounding
surface.
Continuous operation of the air handler motor and UVC germicidal lamp
allows maximum exposure of airborne contaminants to the UVC light.
Advantages and Disadvantages
AdvantageDisadvantage
Can destroy micro-organisms,
such as germs, viruses, bacteria,
and fungi (including mould)
No effect on particulates
including most allergens
Helps prevent illness and diseaseNo effect on chemical fumes,
gases, or cigarette smoke
Does not produce ozone

UV Air Treatment Systems
Integrated Systems
UV lamps have been incorporated into systems that can both purify and filter
the air. These systems can include different filters options including HEPA and
charcoal.
Installation Options
They may be installed to operate as a standalone system, as a partial bypass
arrangement or an insert unit, in either case they do not remove the inline
HVAC filter necessary to protect then fan.
UV Light Types
UV air treatment systems may use different types of UV lights depending on
the type of air treatment being performed. Do not assume that all UV systems
have germicidal capabilities.
Ozone Production
Some UV lights are designed to produce both UVC and VUV light. A VUV light
unit will produce small amount of ozone. This ozone odour may be noticeable.

Electrostatic Filter Installation Best Practices
Proper Positioning
Electrostatic filters must be installed in the correct orientation to ensure proper airflow and filtration efficiency. Always check for airflow direction indicators on the
filter frame.
Secure Mounting
The filter frame must be securely mounted to prevent air bypass around the edges of the filter. Any gaps will significantly reduce filtration effectiveness.
Proper Sealing
Use appropriate gaskets or sealing materials to ensure an airtight fit between the filter frame and the ductwork or plenum. This prevents unfiltered air from
bypassing the filter.

Electrostatic Filter Cleaning Frequency
This chart illustrates the recommended cleaning frequency for electrostatic filters based on different household conditions. Homes with higher levels of airborne contaminants, such as those with pets
or smokers, require more frequent filter cleaning to maintain optimal performance.

Electronic Air Cleaner Components
Pre-filter
The pre-filter screens large particles before they enter the electrostatic field. This prevents excessive arcing and ozone production in the high-voltage section of
the air cleaner cell.
Charging Section
The charging section consists of ionizer wires supplied with high DC voltage that create an electrostatic field. As airborne particles pass through this field, they
become positively or negatively charged.
Collecting Section
The collector cell contains a series of parallel plates with alternating charges that attract and capture the charged particles as they pass through the section.

Electronic Air Cleaner Power Supply
120V AC Input
Standard household current
Step-up Transformer
Increases voltage to 3000-3500V
Rectifier Circuit
Converts to 7500-8500V DC
Power Distribution
Supplies voltage to charging and collecting sections
The power pack is a critical component of the electronic air cleaner system. It converts standard household current into the high-voltage DC
current required for the charging and collecting sections. The step-up transformer increases the incoming 120V AC to 3000-3500V, and
the rectifier circuit (also called a voltage doubler) further converts this to 7500-8500V DC for the charging cells.

EAC Installation Location Considerations
Air Flow Direction
Ensure the EAC is installed with the
correct airflow direction as indicated
on the unit
Clearance Requirements

EAC Electrical Interlock Options
Sail Switch
A mechanical switch activated by air movement in the duct. When the blower is energized,
the air movement causes a fin on the sail switch to move, closing a set of electrical
contacts to the EAC and energizing it.
Current Sensing Relay
Monitors the current draw of the blower motor and activates the EAC when the blower is
running.
Pressure Differential Switch
Detects the pressure difference created by the blower operation and closes the circuit to
the EAC when sufficient pressure is detected.
Direct Wiring
Connects the EAC directly to the blower circuit so that it operates whenever the blower is
energized.

UV Air Purifier Applications
Cooling Coil Treatment
Installing UV lamps near the cooling coil helps reduce mold and bacteria growth in the coil fins, drain pans, and surrounding surfaces, improving system efficiency
and indoor air quality.
Return Air Treatment
Placing UV systems in the return air duct helps neutralize airborne pathogens before they enter the HVAC system, providing whole-house air purification.
Standalone Systems
Portable or wall-mounted UV air purifiers can provide targeted air treatment in specific rooms or areas without modifying the central HVAC system.

The effectiveness of UV air purification systems depends on multiple factors working together. The most critical factor is exposure time - microorganisms must be exposed to
the UV light long enough for inactivation to occur. Light intensity directly impacts how quickly pathogens are neutralized, while the distance from the UV source affects the
intensity reaching the target organisms. Lamp condition deteriorates over time, with most UV lamps requiring replacement every 9-12 months to maintain optimal
performance. Finally, air flow rate must be carefully balanced - too fast and organisms won't receive sufficient exposure, too slow and system efficiency decreases.

UV Lamp Maintenance
Requirements
Monthly Inspection
Visually check that UV lamps are operating (blue glow visible
through viewport if equipped)
Quarterly Cleaning
Gently clean lamp surface with alcohol wipe to remove dust (with
power off)
Semi-Annual Testing
Verify UV intensity with appropriate meter if available
Annual Replacement
Replace UV lamps according to manufacturer's schedule (typically
9-12 months)

Air Filtration Efficiency Comparison
This chart compares the filtration efficiency of different air cleaning technologies for particles 0.3 microns in size. Standard fiberglass filters provide minimal filtration at around 25% efficiency, while pleated media filters
offer moderate improvement at 45%. Electrostatic filters, when clean, can achieve approximately 80% efficiency. Electronic air cleaners provide excellent filtration at 95% efficiency when properly maintained. HEPA filters
offer the highest efficiency at 99.97% but typically require more powerful blower motors due to increased air resistance.

Integrated Air Quality Solutions
Particulate Filtration
Removes dust, pollen, pet
dander, and other airborne
particles using mechanical
or electronic filtration.
Microbial Control
Neutralizes bacteria,
viruses, and mold spores
using UV germicidal
irradiation technology.
Chemical Filtration
Absorbs odors, volatile
organic compounds, and
gaseous pollutants using
activated carbon or other
adsorbent media.
Humidity Control
Maintains optimal humidity
levels to discourage
microbial growth and
enhance comfort.
A comprehensive approach to indoor air quality combines multiple technologies to address different types of air contaminants. While electrostatic
filters and electronic air cleaners excel at removing particulates, UV systems target microorganisms, and activated carbon addresses chemical
pollutants and odors. When properly integrated, these systems work together to provide complete air purification for residential and commercial
environments.

Customer Education Materials
Providing comprehensive educational materials to customers is essential for ensuring proper maintenance and operation of air cleaning systems. These materials should
include clear instructions for routine maintenance tasks, safety information, maintenance schedules, and contact information for professional service. Well-informed
customers are more likely to properly maintain their systems, resulting in better air quality and longer equipment life.

Air Cleaning Technology Selection Guide
Electrostatic Filters
Best for: Homes with standard HVAC systems seeking moderate filtration with low maintenance costs. These washable filters provide good particle removal
without creating significant airflow restriction. Ideal for households with average air quality concerns and those looking to reduce disposable filter waste.
Electronic Air Cleaners
Best for: Homes with occupants who have respiratory sensitivities or allergies. EACs provide superior filtration of fine particles including pollen, dust, and smoke.
They're ideal for households willing to perform regular maintenance in exchange for excellent air quality. Not recommended for homes where ozone sensitivity is a
concern.
UV Air Purifiers
Best for: Homes with concerns about biological contaminants such as mold, bacteria, and viruses. UV systems are excellent supplements to other filtration methods
but shouldn't be the only air cleaning technology. They're particularly valuable in humid climates where microbial growth is a concern or in homes with
immunocompromised occupants.

Humidifiers: Installation,
Operation, and Service
Since the comfort of building occupants depends on both air
temperature and relative humidity, the gas technician/fitter should
understand humidification. There are many types of humidifiers. The gas
technician/fitter must install them carefully so they do not damage the
heating and cooling equipment.

Basic Concept of Central
Humidifiers
Water Supply
A small water line connected to household plumbing carries water to the
humidifying unit
Evaporation
Inside the humidifying unit, water evaporates into the passing air
Distribution
The moistened air increases the humidity level throughout the home
Where central humidifiers differ is in how the evaporation is accomplished, what happens
to any excess water, and what controls are available to regulate the humidification.

Understanding Relative
Humidity
Definition
Relative humidity (RH%) is a measurement of the percentage amount
of water vapour contained in the air compared to the amount that can
be contained (100%) when the air is saturated at the same temperature.
Key Characteristics
•Changes with temperature as warm air can hold more water than
cold air
•Is always low in warm desert climates (such as Arizona)
•Is low inside in the winter (when the temperature is low outside) in
cold climates, such as in much of Canada

Comfort and Relative Humidity
Effects of Low Humidity
•The room may feel colder than its actual temperature
•There may be high levels of static electricity
•Building occupants may be more susceptible to colds
and other airborne viruses since excessive dryness
reduces the effectiveness of the nasal membranes
A humidifier adds moisture to the air, increasing the relative
humidity and the comfort level. In most cases, a relative
humidity of 30-50% is most comfortable for building
occupants.

Condensation Concerns
Condensation of water on inside windows in the form of fogging or frost
is usually an indication of excessive relative humidity. This condensation
can take place in other areas of the building with the possibility of
damage from staining, rotting, and mould.

Types of Humidifiers
By Installation Type
•Stand-alone devices
•Integrated part of the building's
heating and cooling system
By Location
•Installed in the furnace plenum
•Installed in duct
•Attached to the plenum or duct to
introduce water vapor into the air
stream

Humidistat Control
Humidistats installed either in the living area or in the cold air return
control most humidifiers. The basic control for humidifiers is a humidistat
which turns the humidifier on or off according to the humidity level. This
is different from a common household thermostat which controls
temperature.
If the humidifier is connected to a forced-air furnace, it will only work
when the furnace blower is operating. However, there may be times when
the humidifier should be on, but the furnace is off.

Independent Humidifier Operation
Fan-Equipped Humidifiers
Humidifiers that contain their own fans
can independently (and thus better)
regulate the humidity level.
Furnace Fan Control
You can run the furnace fan constantly
in dry periods by adjusting the
thermostat fan auto/on switch to the
on position.
Advanced Humidistats
Humidistats are also available with fan contacts to actuate the fan of a furnace when
humidification is required. They may also be able to activate the cooling system for
dehumidification.

Types of Humidistat Controls
Mechanically Controlled
•Contains a strip of moisture-
sensitive plastic film that elongates
as humidity rises
•When humidity reaches the preset
level, the strip triggers a switch
that turns the humidifier off
•When humidity falls, the strip
shrinks and starts the humidifier
•The dial face will often have a scale
showing the recommended setting
based on outdoor air temperature
Electronically Controlled
•Contains electrical sensors that
vary in resistance as the relative
humidity changes
•Will have connections for an
outdoor temperature sensor
•Can detect very small changes in
relative humidity

Humidistat Positioning
Importance of Position
If the humidistat is not in the right place, the relative humidity will not be
measured correctly, and the building may be less comfortable.
Recommended Location
The humidistat is normally mounted in the return air duct or an area where
air is being controlled. Select a location clear of drafts or excessive
humidity.
Locations to Avoid
Avoid mounting near doors or windows, or in bathrooms and kitchens.
Convenient Placement
A location near the thermostat is convenient for building occupants.

Manual Humidistat
Features of Mechanical Humidistat
The mechanical humidistat will only have one setting, for
relative humidity, and the building occupants set the
humidistat to the desired relative humidity.
This simple control allows users to manually adjust the
humidity level based on comfort needs and outdoor
temperature conditions.

Digital Humidistat Control
Electronic Humidistat Settings
The electronically controlled humidistat will typically have a
manual and automatic setting:
•When on manual setting, it will give the owner direct
control of their RH%, the same as a mechanical
humidistat
•When in automatic mode, if installed with outdoor
sensor, the control will automatically adjust RH% to help
prevent window condensation

Wetted-Element
Humidifiers
All wetted-element humidifiers operate on the same principle. An open
textured medium, the evaporating surface, is wetted, and the water it
contains evaporates into the air.
Medium Types
The medium may be a fixed pad wetted by a spray or fed by gravity,
or it may be dipped into a water reservoir on an electrically-powered
paddle, drum, or rotating belt.
Control
Humidistats control wetted-element humidifiers, turning them on
when humidity falls below the set point.

Drum Humidifiers
Operation
Duct-mounted drum humidifiers contain a 24 V AC motor
and a wheel or drum covered with foam. When the
humidistat calls for humidity, the drum rotates through a
water reservoir. This saturates the foam on the drum, which
then evaporates into the air passing through the humidifier.
The moistened air enters the return air plenum and is
distributed throughout the home by the furnace blower. The
reservoir contains a float and water valve to automatically
control water level and prevent overflows.

Evaporator-Pad Humidifier
Operation Principle
Similar to the drum humidifier, the evaporator-pad
humidifier is duct-mounted and is connected between the
warm-air supply plenum and the return air supply (also
referred to as by-pass type).
Air flows from the warm-air supply plenum through a
moisture-laden evaporator pad, picking up moisture and
returning moist air to the return air supply of the furnace.

Evaporator-Pad Humidifier Features
Water Distribution
The pad is "wetted" by water controlled through a solenoid
valve and distributed over the pad by a distributor trough at
the top of the humidifier.
Mounting Requirements
It is important to mount the humidifier level to ensure that
the trough delivers water uniformly over the entire top
surface of the humidifier pad.
Water Management
Water that does not evaporate drains from the bottom of
the humidifier.
Powered Models
Powered models have a built-in fan which allows the unit to
circulate humidified air even when the heating system is
not in operation.

Spray Humidifiers
Humidity Call
When the humidistat calls for humidity, a solenoid is energized and opens a water valve
Water Flow
Water flows through the 24 V AC solenoid valve and open valve
Spray Action
Water is sprayed on the humidifier medium
Evaporation
From this point, the operation is the same as a drum humidifier

Atomizing Humidifiers
Atomizing humidifiers introduce small droplets of water directly into
either the duct air stream or the conditioned space.
Atomization Methods
•Centrifugal force
•Spray nozzle
•Ultrasonic vibrations
Important Note
Do not use atomizing humidifiers with hard water. The minerals
contained in hard water leave the evaporating water vapour as dust
that will be distributed through the building.

Centrifugal Atomizing Humidifiers
Operating Principle
Centrifugal atomizing humidifiers contain a spinning disc or
cone that breaks the water into a mist, or a rotating disc
which slings water into the air from a reservoir.
This method creates very fine water droplets that can be
easily absorbed into the air stream, providing efficient
humidification.

Spray-Nozzle Atomizing
Humidifiers
Operation
Spray-nozzle atomizing
humidifiers have a fine spray
nozzle that creates fine droplets
and sends them into the duct
airstream. The nozzle may use
water pressure alone or a mixture
of air and water.
Installation Types
Atomizing humidifiers are often
portable or console-type units, but
you can also mount them so that
the water will be directed into a
ducted central system.
Important Caution
If they are connected to the ducts, do not use them when the furnace is not
operating. If the fan is not running, the moisture they introduce can
accumulate and cause corrosion, mildew, and other moisture problems.

Steam Humidifiers
Since steam is water vapour at high temperature, introducing steam into the airstream is an efficient way to add water vapour
to the air.
Self-Contained Type
•Converts tap water to steam by
electrical energy
•Can either be free-standing and
unconnected to the duct system or
inject steam into the duct system
Inject Type
•Inject steam from a boiler into
either the space or duct system
•Must be placed where the air can
absorb the vapour to ensure that
condensation does not occur in the
ducts
Benefits
•Can deliver significant amount of
humidification for large homes or
arid climates
•Use less water than other types of
units

Self-Contained Steam Humidifier
Operation
The self-contained unit generates steam by energizing two
electrodes that extend into a canister of water. The current
flowing between these electrodes causes the water to boil.
The steam then flows from the outlet hose and is injected
into the moving air stream through a dispersion tube
mounted in the ductwork.
You can use a separate fan pack for homes without
ductwork.

Steam Humidifier Dispersion
Tube
Design Features
The design of the dispersion tube
incorporates vertical tubelets that
distribute the steam over the entire
area of the duct and allow any
condensed moisture back into the
steam hose to drain back to the
steam canister.
Installation Requirements
You must mount the dispersion tube
on the vertical dust surface. The
mounting plate will angle the tube
upward. The dispersion tube should
be higher than the humidifier so the
steam hose can be sloped to drain
back to the unit.
Condensation Management
Any condensation that forms on the outer walls of the tubelet is directed back to
the system, preventing moisture accumulation in the ducts.

Humidifier Installation
Overview
Follow Manufacturer's
Instructions
Because there are so many
types of humidifiers, detailed
descriptions of humidifier
installation are not provided.
Follow the manufacturer's
instructions for the specific
model and type of humidifier to
be installed.
Consider Size
Determine the correct size
before a humidifier is installed
to ensure proper humidification

Consult the manufacturers' specifications to ensure that the unit chosen is appropriate for the space to be humidified.

Humidifier Installation Locations
In a bypass duct
You can use wetted-element, or steam humidifiers, here. The bypass
duct is a loop that forms a bypass from supply air plenum and return air
plenum of the main heating system.
In the supply or return-air plenum
You can install wetted-element or atomizing humidifiers here.
Under the supply duct
You can mount steam or wetted-element humidifiers to an opening on
the underside of a supply duct. It is best to choose the supply duct that
serves the largest area in the building.
In the supply duct
You can use wetted-element or atomizing humidifiers. Atomizing
humidifiers must have wiring to operate only when the furnace fan is
operating.

Bypass Humidifier Installation
Bypass Humidifier Function
Humidifiers installed in a bypass location are passive - they
do not contain a fan or other method of moving air. Air
circulates through the units because of differences in
pressure between the warm and cool side of the furnace.
You may mount the bypass humidifier on either the supply
plenum or duct or the cold air return plenum or duct. The
bypass duct must connect the return and supply-side
plenum or ducts, wherever you mount the humidifier.

Installation Restrictions
Never Exhaust Onto
•Air conditioning coils
•Air filters
•Electronic air cleaners (EACs)
•Blowers
•Turns in a duct
Never Install In
•The furnace casing
•Above a heat exchanger
Important Considerations
•Humidifiers should be positioned so if water spills, it will not spill onto
electrical components
•The humidifier location must allow access for service and maintenance
•If a humidifier is used with an EAC, it must be located downstream
from the latter to avoid damage to the cleaner

Bypass Humidifier Positioning
Positioning Procedure
1.Select a location for the bypass on the opposite plenum
2.Select a location that cannot damage the air conditioner
A-coil during installation
3.Select a location where the duct provided is adequate to
connect the humidifier to the bypass
The sidewalls of humidifiers are interchangeable to allow
bypass duct mounting on either side of the humidifier.

Humidifier Positioning
Guidelines
1
Avoid Furnace Body
Do not locate the humidifier or bypass on a furnace body
2
Allow Clearance
Allow adequate clearance in front of and above the humidifier so you
can easily remove the cover to perform routine maintenance
3
Maintain Height
Mount the humidifier at least 3 inches (78 mm) above the furnace body
to allow adequate space for the solenoid valve and drain line
4
Prevent Freezing
Mount the humidifier in a conditioned space to prevent freezing

Humidistat Location Selection
Select Location
Select a location for the humidistat on the return plenum or on the wall in the
living space
Consider Ease of Installation
Mounting on the return plenum is the easiest installation for the control
wiring circuit
Ensure Proper Sensing
For return duct mount, place the humidistat upstream from the
humidifier or bypass so that it can properly sense the relative humidity
of the living space
Maintain Distance
Locate the control at least 8 inches (203 mm) upstream from the
humidifier in the return air duct

Fan Humidifiers
Fan Humidifier Features
Fan humidifiers, also known as powered or flow-through,
use the fan inside the humidifier to pull duct air through the
humidifier.
Access to only the supply or the return is required, making
installation more flexible than bypass models that require
connections to both supply and return.

Water Supply Considerations
Hard Water Problems
Hard water -- water that contains a high mineral content --
can cause various problems in humidifiers:
•Nozzles, tubes, and evaporative elements may collect
precipitated solids and become clogged
•Mineral solids that enter the air stream can leave a layer
of white dust on furniture and floors throughout the
home
Solutions
•You can soften the water supply to the humidifier
•This process usually adds sodium to the water
•Since the sodium itself precipitates out in humidifier
reservoirs over an extended period, make a provision
for the reservoir to be flushed out on an ongoing or
periodic basis
•You can add chemicals that prevent scaling (the
precipitation of minerals) to the humidifier pan
Consult the manufacturer's literature before adding any
chemicals to the humidifier.

Water Supply Connection Methods
Saddle Valve
For copper water tubing systems, a
saddle valve often comes with various
manufacturers of humidifiers
installation packages. Though they
are considered "easy to install", this
type of connection should not be
recommended. The saddle valve is
prone to failure and can cause
enormous property damage.
Note: In Ontario, the Ontario Building
Code states that a saddle valve "shall
not be installed".
Recommended Method
Install a full-size tee fitting and
approved valve on the water line. This
provides a more reliable and code-
compliant connection.

Furnace-Humidifier Electrical
Connection
Atomizing Humidifier
Requirements
Atomizing humidifiers installed in a
duct or plenum must operate only
when the furnace blower is operating.
If the air is not moving, the drops will
fall on the duct surface, causing
moisture accumulation, which can
encourage mildew growth and cause
corrosion.
Electrical Interlock
To ensure the atomizing humidifier
works only when the blower is
operating, an electrical interlock is
required. This is accomplished by
installing a sail switch in the return air
duct that closes electrical contacts
when air is moving.
Evaporative Humidifiers
Evaporative humidifiers (wetted-element) may operate independently of the
furnace, so no interlock is required.

Transformer Wiring Guidelines
Separate Transformer
The humidifier must not be connected to the transformer on the furnace, if there is
one, since this could overload the furnace transformer.
Avoid Thermostat Circuit
The humidifier transformer should not be wired into the thermostat circuit. If it is,
the thermostat would receive a different current draw depending on whether the
humidistat was calling for moisture.
Direct Drive Motor Protection
If a humidifier transformer is installed on a furnace with a direct drive motor, the
wiring and control system must prevent the humidifier transformer from
overvoltage created by the motor's idle windings.
Follow Diagrams
Follow all manufacturer's wiring diagrams for proper installation.

Sheet Metal and Drain Considerations
Sheet Metal Modifications
When a humidifier is installed in or
under a duct, in a plenum, or in a bypass
duct, make modifications to the sheet
metal.
Follow the manufacturer's instructions
for the specific humidifier concerning
the size of the openings required and
proper sealing of openings.
Drain Requirements
Ideally, all the water flowing into the
humidifying unit would evaporate, but
in reality, most systems end up with
leftover water. The usual solution is to
provide a drain tube, but this means
that the humidifier must have access to
a drain pipe.
Some designs retain and recycle the
incoming water until it all evaporates,
but the trade-off for this approach is
that you can't use the reduction in fresh
water to carry away any mineral
deposits that prevent potential mould
buildup.

Operation and Service Overview
Seasonal Inspection
Check the operation of the humidifier
when inspecting the forced-air furnace
prior to the start of the heating season.
Cleaning Importance
It is especially important to be sure that
the humidifier is clean before the heating
season starts.
Health Concerns
If water remains in a humidifier for an
extended period (for example, over the
summer), it may become a breeding
environment for fungi, bacteria, algae,
and viruses. If the reservoir is not cleaned
before the furnace blower is turned on,
these contaminants can be distributed
throughout the house, lowering indoor air
quality.

Common Operation Requirements
Check factors such as water level, mechanical operation, and humidistat function. The guidelines for operation given here are general. Check the
manufacturer's specifications for specific operation requirements.
FactorDescription
Water level correctIf the water level in the reservoir is too high, water can overflow into
ducts, ultimately causing corrosion and/or development of mildew. The
water level must be set to the manufacturer's specifications.
Float valve assembly operatingThe float valve assembly must be working and adjusted properly to
maintain the correct water level.
Humidistat workingTo check the operation of the humidistat, having an independent
measure of the relative humidity in the building is necessary. A sling
psychrometer can provide this confirmation.
Clean overflow/drain line and reservoir panYou may need to remove the hose for cleaning. Check to be sure the
drain is not blocked. Clean the reservoir pan at the beginning and end of
the heating season, or more frequently if the pan seems slimy. Ensure
that the customer understands how to clean the humidifier according to
manufacturer's instructions.

Service Guidelines for Different Humidifier Types
Wetted-Element Humidifiers
•If the wetted element is mounted on a drum or paddle,
the drum or paddle must turn for the humidifier to
operate correctly
•Clean or replace the media in wetted-element
humidifiers at the beginning of every season
•You must keep the humidifier pad clean to permit proper
absorption and evaporation of water
•If the media is a cleanable type, you can wash it with
detergent
•You can scrape mineral (scale) deposits loose, lightly
with a putty knife, if necessary
•Replace the humidifier pad if it will no longer conform to
the drum properly after cleaning
Other Humidifier Types
•Atomizing humidifiers: The nozzle must be spraying
freely or the drum turning
•Steam humidifiers:
•Steam generation must be occurring, and the nozzle
must not be blocked
•Inspect steam hose to ensure it has no low spots and
has constant upward slope from humidifier to
dispersion tube
•If dispersion tube is mounted below the humidifier,
inspect the drip tee drain and trap
•Check for loose electrical connections on the canister

•Electrical system
Important Note
In extreme weather conditions, few humidifiers can provide the
desired humidity level.

Testing Relative Humidity
Sling Psychrometer
The sling psychrometer measures air temperature using two
thermometers, a wet bulb, and a dry bulb mounted on a
base. The apparatus has a handle that allows it to rotate
rapidly in the air.
As the psychrometer moves, air flows over the
thermometers. Moisture evaporates from the wet bulb.
When the temperature stabilizes on the two thermometers,
readings are taken and compared to tables provided with
the device to find the relative humidity based on the two
temperatures.

Modern Humidity Measurement Devices
Electronic Humidity Measurement
Modern electronic devices use the following to measure
humidity changes, allowing a gas technician/fitter to
measure relative humidity without a sling action:
•Temperature of condensation
•Changes in electrical resistance
•Changes in electrical capacitance
Digital Psychrometer
A digital psychrometer is an example of modern electronic
device that is now available for quick and accurate humidity
measurements.

Troubleshooting the Humidistat
Testing Response
When testing relative humidity, set
the humidistat for a higher level to see
if it activates.
Calibration Issues
If the humidistat is functioning and
the relative humidity in the
conditioned space is not what it is
calling for, the humidistat may be
incorrectly calibrated. It may be
possible to recalibrate the humidistat,
or it may need replacement.
Outdoor Sensor Problems
If the outdoor temperature reading is not accurate:
•Check the connection to the outdoor temperature sensor
•Check the location and mounting of the sensor
•Check the resistance of the sensor and compare to the manufacturer's
temperature/resistance table

Troubleshooting Water Supply Issues
Supply Line
Make sure the supply line has not become plugged and that the float valve is adjusted
properly, so an optimum level of water is maintained in the reservoir.
Float Valve
If the float is damaged, you can replace it. If the humidifier overflows, and the level/float
setting is correct, the seat on the entire float assembly may need replacement.
Wetted Element
If the humidifier is based on a wetted element, make sure the medium is not clogged,
dirty, or saturated with mineral deposits. Clean or replace it if necessary.
Atomizing Components
In an atomizing humidifier, make sure the drum is turning properly and the spray nozzle
is not blocked.

Troubleshooting Electrical
Connections
No Function
If the humidifier is not
functioning at all, the problem
may be electrical. Check circuit
breakers, the humidistat, and
low-voltage controls if there are
any.
Motor Issues
If the humidifier has a motor— as
some atomizing and wetted
element types do - check it to see
if it is burned out.
Mineral Deposits
Mineral deposits may cause a humidifier to switch itself off. If a
component is locked or bound because of a mineral buildup, in some
humidifiers, a thermal fault overload protector may open, shutting the
unit off. In this case, clean or replace the component.

Other Potential Problems
Potential ProblemDescription
DustIf excessive dust is caused by a humidifier, the dust will be white
since the cause is mineral buildup. Clean or replace the media.
Moisture in the ductsMoisture may be found in the ducts if an atomizing humidifier is
installed, and the humidifier is operating when the furnace
blower is not. The atomizing humidifier must operate only when
the furnace blower is on and the furnace is operating. Check to be
sure it is not operating when the "fan only" mode is selected since
heat is required to evaporate the water droplets created by the
atomizing humidifier.
Water overflowThe float valve may need cleaning, replacement, or adjustment if
water has overflowed. Check the drainage/overflow line in case it
has become blocked.

Checking and Cleaning Cooling Coils
Adding a cooling coil to a forced air furnace adapts it for use as a central air conditioner.
Although air conditioning technicians perform the installation and servicing of the air conditioning unit, as a gas technician/fitter, you must clean
the cooling coil as part of regular furnace maintenance.
A dirty coil, like a dirty furnace filter, restricts air flow.
Cooling Coil
Also known as an "A" coil because of its shape, it may be attached
to the supply plenum or in a cabinet between the supply plenum
and the duct.
Condenser
Usually located outside the building, it works with the cooling coil
to circulate refrigerant.

How Cooling Systems Work
Compressor Operation
The compressor moves the refrigerant around the loop.
Heat Absorption
As the furnace forces air through the "A" coil, the coil absorbs heat from the air, causing the liquid refrigerant to change to the vapour state.
Heat Removal
The refrigerant vapour moves to the condenser coil where heat is removed to the outdoors, causing the vaporous refrigerant to return to a liquid state.
Cycle Completion
The liquid refrigerant returns to the cooling coil.

Types of Cooling Coil Units
Up-flow furnaces
Cooling coils designed
specifically for upward
airflow systems.
Down-flow furnaces
Cooling coils designed
specifically for downward
airflow systems.
Horizontal furnaces
Cooling coils designed specifically for horizontal airflow systems.
The coil is housed in a cabinet.

Cooling Coil Locations
Figure 3-3 shows possible locations of the cooling coil cabinet. The liquid used as a coolant varies depending on the specific
unit.
Cabinet Placement
The cooling coil cabinet can be placed in various locations
depending on the furnace type and installation
requirements.
Coolant Variation
Different cooling systems may use different types of
refrigerant depending on the manufacturer
specifications and environmental regulations.

Measuring Temperature
Change
Create Access Points
Punch or drill a hole in the supply and return air plenums. Where
possible the holes should be about three feet from the furnace.
Insert Thermometers
Place a thermometer into the air flow through each of the holes.
Most good quality electronic multimeters have a temperature
probe accessory or a pocket digital thermometer that works.
Operate and Measure
Operate the equipment for about five minutes, with the fan
running to establish the normal air temperature rise or drop,
which is the difference between supply air temperature and
return air temperature.

Temperature Calculation
Methods
To calculate temperatureThen
Drop across the coilSubtract the supply side
temperature from the return
side temperature.
Rise across the heat exchangerSubtract the return side
temperature from the supply
side temperature.

Diagnosing Temperature Change
Measure Normal Operation
Note that the temperature drop across the cooling coil is about 11 °C
(20°F) when it is operating at a typical condition of 24 °C (75°F) and
50% relative humidity.
Identify Issues
If the measured temperature drop is too low, you may need to clean
the cooling coil unit or adjust the blower.
Check Specifications
Refer to the manufacturer's manual for the correct temperature drop
and air volume.
Clean and Retest
Clean the unit and retest temperature drop before adjusting the
blower speed.
Make Adjustments
Then, if necessary, adjust the blower speed to obtain the correct
pressure drop and air volume.
Refer if Needed
If the blower is not operating correctly, you will need to refer the
customer to a refrigeration and air conditioning mechanic to
troubleshoot the cooling system.

Importance of Coil Cleanliness
The surfaces of the cooling coil must be clean.
Reduced Cooling Capacity
During the cooling season, the coil will not deliver its full cooling capacity.
Restricted Air Flow
Air flow to the building will be reduced.
Increased Temperature
During the heating season, both temperature rise across the furnace and
stack temperature will increase.
Regular Inspection
The coil will require visual checking for cleanliness when the furnace is
cleaned.

Accessing the Cooling Coil

port.

Cleaning the Cooling Coil: Overview
The cooling coil requires cleaning when it is dirty. For the gas technician/fitter, this involves cleaning the:
Exterior Cleaning
Cleaning the exterior of the coil itself to ensure proper heat transfer.
Fin Cleaning
Cleaning the fins through which air is forced over the coil to maintain proper airflow.
Exact cleaning procedures vary depending on the unit that has been installed. Consult the manufacturer's  instructions for specifics.

Cleaning Procedure: Fin
Inspection
Check Fins
Check the fins for accumulated dirt or dust.
Clean If Necessary

compressed air or nitrogen, brush or a fin comb.
Use Caution
Use the vacuum, brush, or comb carefully to not damage the
coil.

Cleaning Procedure: Tubing
Inspection
Inspect Connections
Inspect the tubing and connections for signs of oil leaks.
Identify Leaks
Spots of oil indicate a leak that the air conditioning technician must
repair.
Clean Surfaces
Brush or clean outer surfaces of the lines with a vacuum cleaner.
Wash If Needed
If necessary, you can wash them with low-pressure water
and mild detergent.

Cleaning Procedure: Condensate System
Check Drain System
Check and clean the condensate drain system.
Clean Drip Tray

accessory or a pocket digital thermometer that works for measuring
temperature changes in HVAC systems.
Precision Measurement
Digital thermometers provide accurate temperature readings
essential for proper HVAC diagnostics.
Portability
Pocket-sized digital thermometers are convenient for field
technicians to carry and use.
Versatility
Many digital thermometers can be used for multiple applications
beyond HVAC work.

Refrigerant Vapour Compression Cycle
Compression
The compressor moves the refrigerant around the loop.
Heat Absorption
As the furnace forces air through the "A" coil, the coil absorbs
heat from the air, causing the liquid refrigerant to change to the
vapour state.
Condensation
The refrigerant vapour moves to the condenser coil where heat is
removed to the outdoors, causing the vaporous refrigerant to
return to a liquid state.

Return
The liquid refrigerant returns to the cooling coil.

Typical Cooling Coil
A cooling coil (sometimes called an "A" coil because of its shape) is a critical
component in air conditioning systems that work with forced-air furnaces.
Design Purpose
The A-shaped design maximizes
surface area for heat exchange
while fitting within the
constraints of typical HVAC
systems.
Installation Location
May be attached to the supply
plenum or in a cabinet between
the supply plenum and the duct.
Maintenance Responsibility
While installation is performed by refrigeration technicians, regular
cleaning is the responsibility of gas technicians during furnace
maintenance.

Temperature Measurement Process
Creating Access Points
Punch or drill holes in the supply and return air plenums, ideally about three feet from the furnace, to allow for temperature measurement.
Inserting Measurement Tools
Place thermometers or temperature probes into the airflow through each of the access holes to get accurate readings.
