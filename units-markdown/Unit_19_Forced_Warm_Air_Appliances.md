Calculation Constant
Used in CFM formula (derived from air
properties)
A typical furnace is designed to operate at a maximum of 0.50 inch w.c. external static pressure. The gas technician must select a fan
speed that maintains the temperature rise within the manufacturer's parameters while not exceeding this ESP limit.

Furnace Airflow Selection Process
Calculate Required CFM
Use formula or manufacturer's tables to determine needed airflow
Reference Speed Tables
Check manufacturer's data for your specific furnace model
Select Speed Tap
Choose appropriate connection based on required CFM and ESP
Measure Temperature Rise
Verify actual temperature difference is within specifications
Check Static Pressure
Confirm ESP is below maximum allowable value

Furnace Safety Circuit Integration
Primary Safety Controls
High-limit and rollout switches
Airflow Safety
Pressure switches and inducer monitoring
3
Combustion Safety
Flame sensors and gas valve control
4
Electronic Monitoring
IFC self-diagnostics and error detection
Modern furnaces integrate multiple layers of safety controls that work together to prevent unsafe operation. These systems are
designed with redundancy to ensure that if one safety mechanism fails, others will still protect the home and occupants.

Evolution of Furnace Control
Technology
Electro-Mechanical Era
Simple controls with standing pilots and mechanical switches
2
Electronic Control Introduction
Mid-efficiency furnaces with electronic ignition and basic circuit boards
3
Integrated Control Systems
High-efficiency models with comprehensive IFC modules
Smart Connected Systems
Modern furnaces with remote monitoring and advanced diagnostics
As furnace technology has evolved, the components that control operation have improved
dramatically, from simple electro-mechanical controls to sophisticated electronic systems
that optimize performance and safety.

Furnace Maintenance and
Troubleshooting Best Practices
Regular Inspection
Check all safety switches, electrical connections, and control components annually
Systematic Diagnosis
Follow manufacturer's troubleshooting guides and flow charts when problems occur
Proper Testing
Use appropriate tools to measure voltage, resistance, pressure, and temperature
Documentation
Record all maintenance and repairs, including error codes and corrective actions
Effective furnace maintenance and troubleshooting requires a thorough understanding of both the
mechanical and electrical components and how they interact. Always prioritize safety and follow
manufacturer guidelines when servicing equipment.

Summary: Electrical Circuits and
Components in Gas Furnaces
Evolution of Technology
From simple electro-mechanical controls in older furnaces to sophisticated electronic systems
in modern high-efficiency models
Control Circuits
Electrical components that determine when and how the furnace operates, controlling the
blower and firing sequence
Safety Circuits
Critical components that prevent unsafe operation by monitoring temperature, pressure, and
proper combustion
Troubleshooting Skills
Gas technicians must understand these circuits and be able to use diagnostic equipment to
identify and resolve issues
Understanding the operation of control and safety circuits in both older and modern furnaces is
essential for proper installation, maintenance, and troubleshooting of gas-fired heating equipment.
