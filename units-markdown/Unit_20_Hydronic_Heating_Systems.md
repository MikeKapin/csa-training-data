## 3.5 mph (5.8 kph) at the pool surface. Factors such as exposure to sun and wind, relative humidity, and cooler night-time

temperatures affect a pool's heating load.

Sizing Example

The example is based on a pool with an average depth of 5.5 feet (1.66 m).

Other System Sizing Considerations
Gas Pipe Sizing
Sizing of the gas piping for a pool heater installation
conforms with normal pipe sizing procedures, which are
detailed in Unit 10 Piping and tubing systems for industrial
and commercial applications.
Vent Sizing
Vent sizing, materials, and other installation requirements
are specified in the pool heater manufacturer's instructions.
In all cases, venting must conform to all applicable Codes.

Pump and Filter Sizing
Pump Sizing
Pump (circulator) sizing is covered in more detail in Chapter
2. Distribution and control systems, including:
•Filter type and flow rate
•Pool water turnover time
Follow the manufacturer's requirements for pool pumping
systems.
Filter Sizing
Pool filter sizing is based on:
•Filter type and flow rate
•Pool water turnover time

Filter Types and Flow Rates
Filter typeFlow rate
Diatomaceous earth1 – 2 US gpm (0.065 – 0.126 L/s)
Rapid sand3 - 5 US gpm (0.189 - 0.315 L/s)
High-rate sand15 – 20 US gpm (0.945 – 1.26 L/s)
Fabric cartridge0.5 - 1 US gpm (0.031 - 0.063 L/s)
Pool filters are classified according to their filter media. Flow rate differs for each type of filter media and is measured in US gpm per square foot of
filter area.

Turnover Time and Filter Sizing
Turnover Time Definition
Turnover time is the length of time (in hours) required to
circulate all the water in the pool once through the filter.
Determining Filter Size
Filter manufacturer's catalogues usually specify filter sizes
based on the relationship between pool capacity and
turnover time, calculated as follows:
1.Filter rate = pool capacity (US gal) ÷ (turnover time × 60)
= pool capacity (Liters) ÷ (turnover time × 3600)
2.Filter area = filter rate ÷ flow rate
3.From the manufacturer's catalogue, select the size and
number of filters required to match the filter area.

Cleaning and Winterizing
Regular Maintenance
Regular cleaning of heat exchanger tubes and preparation
of the pool equipment for winter are important pool heater
maintenance and service items.
Heat Exchanger Vulnerability
The inside surfaces of a pool heater's heat exchanger tubes
are vulnerable to scale accumulation. Soot from incomplete
combustion and corrosion products can accumulate on the
exterior surfaces of the tubes.

Cleaning Heat Exchanger Tubes
Exterior Cleaning
In most cases, you can remove soot and corrosion on the
exterior surfaces of heat exchanger tubes using a wire
brush. You may also use a high-velocity water spray if the
heat exchanger is removed from the heater. Using water for
cleaning with the heat exchanger in place may damage the
combustion chamber and heater insulation.
Interior Cleaning Methods
You can clean the inside surfaces of heat exchanger tubes in
two ways:
•Acid cleaning
•Reaming

Safety Precautions for Cleaning
Safety Requirements
Technicians/fitters must always
follow proper WHMIS/WHMIS
2015 and other recommended
procedures and use the prescribed
protective clothing and safety
equipment when performing
cleaning operations.
Personal Safety
In Unit 1 Safety, Chapter 1. On-the-
job safety measures details
information on personal safety and
personal protective equipment
(PPE).
Hazardous Materials
Chapter 3. Hazardous materials covers information on handling hazardous
products.

Acid Cleaning Procedure
Remove Heat Exchanger
Remove the heat exchanger tube assembly from the heater in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
Prepare Acid Solution
Immerse the tube assembly in a solution of three parts water to one part muriatic acid.
Monitor Cleaning Process
Observe the action of the acid solution on the tube assembly. When the tubes appear to be clean, remove the assembly from the acid
solution.
Rinse Thoroughly
Thoroughly rinse the assembly with a soda-ash solution, then with clean water.
Dry and Protect
Let the assembly dry thoroughly and then apply heat-resistant, rust-inhibiting paint in accordance with manufacturer's instructions.
Reassemble the heat exchanger and heater. Dispose of the acid and soda-ash solutions in accordance with WHMIS/WHMIS 2015 and applicable
environmental regulations.

Reaming Procedure
Remove Heat Exchanger
Remove the heat exchanger tube assembly from the heater in accordance with the manufacturer's  instructions.
Dry Thoroughly
Thoroughly dry the heat exchanger -- this makes the tubes easier to ream out.
Select Proper Reamer
Measure the inside diameter of the tubes and select a carbide-tipped reamer of the same diameter.
Ream Tubes
Ream the inside of the tubes, removing the reamer frequently to clear powdered scale and debris and prevent binding.
Clean and Reassemble
Blow or rinse the tubes clean after reaming is completed. Reassemble the heat exchanger and heater.

Winterizing
Seasonal Preparation
In areas where a pool will not be used during the winter
months, it must be winterized.
Winterizing Process
Winterizing generally includes:
•Draining all water from the pool heater, circulation
equipment, and piping system
•Removing or weatherproofing of electrical and
mechanical equipment that could be damaged by
exposure to winter conditions
•Closing off pool and equipment openings to prevent
accumulation of debris and provide protection from rain
and snow

Draining the System
Open Drain Valves
Open all drain valves.
Remove Drain Plugs
Remove all drain plugs.
Allow Gravity Drainage
Allow as much water as possible
to drain from the system by
gravity.
Use Compressed Air
Any water left in the system can
be blown out by means of
compressed air or inert gases.
It is important to ensure that no water is left in the heat exchanger of the pool heater. Even during short periods of freezing temperatures,
stagnant water in the exchanger tubes can form ice which will expand and split the tubes.

Freezing Damage Prevention
Freezing Risk
If water can remain in pool equipment and piping during
below-freezing conditions, it will freeze and expand,
splitting pipes and otherwise damaging the equipment.
Seasonal Startup Caution
Take care when attempting to ignite the burner of a pool
heater for the first time in a season. Pool heaters are more
dangerous than other types of boilers because spiders may
crawl into burner throats and pilot heads and it is difficult to
hear the burner gas flowing or the click of the millivolt valve
over the sound of the nearby pump.

Troubleshooting Overview
Table 5-1 outlines common pool heater burner and ignition problems and their causes. Understanding these issues and their
remedies is essential for proper maintenance and repair of pool heating systems.
Common Problems
•Delayed ignition
•Heater will not operate
•Pilot will not light or remain lit
•Slow heater output
•Heater will not shut off
Diagnostic Approach
When troubleshooting pool heater issues, it's important to
systematically check each potential cause before moving to
the next. This ensures that the true problem is identified and
properly addressed.
