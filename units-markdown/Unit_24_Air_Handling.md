Air Changes Per Hour
Typical residential ventilation requirement
Understanding air handling principles is essential for gas technicians/fitters to ensure safe, efficient, and effective operation of gas-fired
heating and ventilation systems. Proper application of these principles helps maintain indoor air quality, occupant comfort, and equipment
longevity while meeting all applicable codes and standards.

Air Handling Units
Air movement in a building comes about because of the relationship
between the properties of the air itself and the building, the blower
moving the air, and the duct system. In this presentation, we'll explore air
handling devices and the duct system in detail. Understanding the
electrical and mechanical components of blowers and their service and
adjustment is essential for gas technicians and fitters.

Purpose of Air Handling Units
Building Comfort
Air handling units ensure proper
air movement throughout a
building to maintain comfort
levels for occupants.
Temperature Control
They work with heating and
cooling systems to distribute
conditioned air to maintain
desired temperatures.
Air Quality
Air handling units help filter and
circulate fresh air, improving
indoor air quality.

Key Terminology
Air handling deviceAny device that moves air in a ducted system
DampersUsed in duct systems to control the flow of air
Electronically commutated motor (ECM)A brushless dc, variable speed motor that uses less energy but delivers
more torque than the standard PSC motor
Permanent split capacitor (PSC)A capacitor motor that uses its start winding and capacitor
continuously without change in capacitance

Gas-Fired Duct Furnaces
Definition
Gas-fired duct furnaces are designed for use in ducted
applications with a separate air handling device. They can be
installed inside or outside a building and are most frequently
used in commercial and industrial settings.
Flexibility
Because duct furnaces use a separate air source, they allow
for considerable flexibility in air flow delivery. For example,
multiple duct furnaces can be used with an air handling unit
to provide zone heating.

Duct Furnace Configurations
Typically, duct furnaces are used in conjunction with filters, cooling coils,
and an air handler to provide a complete heating, cooling, and air
handling system for a building. Configurations vary depending on
building structure and heating and cooling requirements.
Indoor Duct Furnaces
Designed for installation in buildings, usually suspended from the
main roof beams.
Outdoor Duct Furnaces
Weatherproof and designed for outdoor installation, working with
HVAC and makeup air systems.

Indoor Duct Furnaces
Safe Venting
Use only vent materials approved for use with the indoor duct furnace.
Clearances
Pay attention to clearances required from combustible material and
clearances to fresh air intakes and other vents.
Accessibility
Vents must not block access to the furnace and must be accessible for
cleaning.
No Restrictions
Never install dampers or any other device that cause vent restriction.

Outside Duct Furnaces
Down-flow Plenum
In duct furnaces with a down-flow plenum, the blower fan forces supply air down into
the plenum as it leaves the heat exchanger, for subsequent dispersion through the
ducts.
Horizontal Plenum
In duct furnaces with a horizontal plenum, the supply air is blown through the heat
exchanger in a straight line, into the plenum, for subsequent dispersion through the
ducts.

Outdoor Duct Furnace
Venting
Natural Draft Vented
Uses natural convection to remove combustion gases, relying on the
tendency of hot gases to rise.
Power Vented
Uses a fan or blower to force combustion gases out of the furnace
and through the venting system.

Installation and Mounting Options
Roof Curbs
Constructed of heavy gauge steel. The duct furnace unit has sealing to the roof curb using a neoprene gasket.
Base Frames
An iron base frame running the length and width of the unit supports the frame. Base rails must be sealed to the roofing material and be
the same width apart as the unit's main frame rails.
Suspension Mountings
Mounting points are provided on the unit for easy installation using threaded rods.

Installation Requirements
Must
•Be well supported
•Be installed with appropriate clearances on all sides
•Provide access for required service
•Be installed upstream from air conditioning coils
Must Not
•Be installed inside if intended for outside
•Be located under an overhang
•Have the heat exchanger subject to negative pressure
•Have downstream duct furnaces operate before
upstream ones

Combustion Air
Requirements
It is important that air used in the combustion process not contain materials
that can harm the heat exchanger.
Harmful Chemicals
Many chemicals used in
industrial processes can
damage heat exchangers,
including halogen-type
refrigerants, cleaning
solvents, and printing inks.
Chlorine Products
Chlorine-based products
including waxes, cleaners,
and pool chemicals should be
kept away from combustion
air.
Laundry Products
Laundry products can contain chemicals that may damage heat
exchangers if present in combustion air.

Supply Air Fan Checks
Check Motor Starter Overloads
Ensure they are correctly adjusted to the full load current shown on
the motor nameplate, and all thermal resets are made.
Set Fan Switch
If the unit has a remote fan switch, set it to the ON position.
Check Fan Rotation
Verify the correct rotation of the supply fan. If necessary,
reverse any two leads on a three-phase motor or follow
manufacturer's wiring diagram.
Verify Amperes Draw
Make sure amperes draw of supply motor does not exceed
amperes on rating plate of motor.

Other Air Handling Components
Manufacturers typically custom-design air handling equipment for commercial and
industrial applications as required for specific installations. A typical duct furnace can
be installed in conjunction with many different blowers, in different sizes, and with
different duct configurations.
Custom Design
Except for the simplest air handling
installations, the equipment is
custom designed and built.
Discharge Options
Equipment may be designed for top
discharge, bottom discharge, or side
discharge, depending on the
configuration required.
Air Conditioning Coils
These may become dirty and reduce air flow through the duct system. Always
inspect and clean these additional components as necessary.

The Duct System
The proper design of an air handling system — whether for residential, commercial, or industrial use — is not just a matter of
selecting the individual components. The blower, heating and cooling units, add-on devices, and duct systems must all work
together to make the space comfortable and safe for building occupants.
Purpose
The duct system distributes heated or cooled air to the
conditioned space. It must let the air move freely, but at the
same time, it must not be oversized.
Considerations
•New construction
•Renovations or retrofits
•Troubleshooting existing systems

Function of Duct Systems
Blower Push
The blower pushes air into the
supply side duct system.
Air Diffusion
Air is diffused into the conditioned
building space.
Return Air
Air moves from the space into the
return air ducts and returns to the
blower.

Supply Air Side: Extended
Plenum
In an extended plenum system, a trunk duct — the same size as the
furnace plenum — carries air to small ducts called branches to circulate
air to the building's rooms. Branch ducts are usually round and typically
five or six inches in diameter.
Trunk Duct
Same size as the furnace
plenum throughout its
length.
Branch Ducts
Small round ducts that
deliver air to individual
rooms.
Positioning
Takes the plenum closer to the branch connections farthest from
the blower.

Supply Air Side: Reducing
Plenum
The reducing plenum system is also called a graduated trunk system. Like the
extended plenum system, the reducing plenum system uses branches to deliver
air to rooms. The size of the trunk duct is reduced as branch ducts are added.
Graduated Sizing
The trunk duct gets smaller as
branch ducts are added along its
length.
Pressure Maintenance
When properly sized, the same
pressure is maintained along the
trunk's length and in the branches.
Efficiency
This design helps ensure even air distribution throughout the system.

Supply Air Side: Perimeter Loop
A perimeter loop system is particularly suited for installation in a concrete floor. The loop can run around the perimeter to the
outer walls, with the outlets next to the wall. When the furnace fan is running, there is warm air in the whole loop.
Concrete Floor
Installation
Ideal for installation in concrete
slab construction.
Even Temperature
Keeps the slab at an even
temperature throughout.
Constant Pressure
Since the loop is at a constant
pressure, air pressure is the
same to all outlets.

Supply Air Side: Radial System
In a radial system, supply air is delivered from a central plenum to a separate duct for each register. Since warm air ducts are
normally located below joist level, a radial system will reduce head room in the basement.
Central Plenum
Air is distributed from a central
point to individual ducts.
Individual Ducts
Each register has its own dedicated
duct running from the central
plenum.
Best Applications
More suitable for crawl space or
slab construction due to headroom
requirements.

Return Air Side
Central Return
In a central return system, one return air grille is installed on
each floor of the building in a central location. Pressure
differences draw air from all rooms to the return air grille.
For the system to function, there must be a clear path for
the air: open doorways, doors with grillwork openings, or
undercut doors may be used.
Individual Return
Individual return air systems have a return air grille in every
room, except kitchens, bathrooms, or rooms without supply
air.
This system is more expensive than a central return system,
but will give the most positive return air system. Return air
ducts are usually slightly larger than the supply duct, so
there is less resistance to air flow in the return system.

Components of Duct Systems:
Take-offs
Take-offs are fittings that draw some or all of the air from a plenum or duct into another duct.
Plenum Take-offs
Typically the same width as the plenum and serve as the transition between the plenum
and the supply-side duct.
Top Take-offs
Draw air from major duct sections and direct it into smaller sections for diffusion into the
conditioned space.
Side Take-offs
Similar to top take-offs but positioned on the side of the duct.
Universal Take-offs
Can be used either on the side or on the top of ductwork, performing the same function.

Components of Duct Systems:
Transition Fittings
To ensure even air circulation and prevent excessive pressures on ductwork, changes in duct volume
must be gradual. This is accomplished by installing transition fittings.
Transition Piece
A fitting used to connect ducts that have different-shaped mating surfaces.
Right-angle Boot
A fitting going from rectangular to round on a 90° angle. Sometimes used when going from an
interior wall space containing rectangular ducts to a round duct.
Universal Boot
A fitting used to make a transition from a rectangular to a round duct without changing direction.
End Boot
A fitting going from rectangular to round, with the length of the rectangle in line with the round
duct.

Components of Duct Systems: Dampers
Dampers are used in duct systems to control the flow of air. They may be installed in the duct system to control air flow to the building space.
Operation
When the damper is closed, the plates overlap and air flow is stopped.
When the damper is open, the plates allow air passage between them.
Typically, dampers are made of metal plates. Dampers for supply
registers are made of a single metal piece and are available in all supply
duct shapes and sizes.
Control Methods
•Manually (for example, dampers on supply registers in residential
applications)
•Automatically by a temperature-activated device or end switch

Components of Duct Systems:
Outlets and Connectors
Grille
Perforation or louvred cover
installed at the outlet or
intake of a duct.
Diffusers
Outlets in the duct system
supply side, through which
warmed or cooled air enters
the heated or cooled space
of the building.
Block Ends
End cap of a duct.
Drive Cleat
A clip hammered on to the
preformed edges of duct to
hold two pieces of duct
together.

Components of Duct Systems:
Structural Elements
Joist Liner
Sheet metal covering the space between two joists, allowing the space to be
used as a duct.
Riser
A vertical duct or fitting that connects two ducts that are parallel but at
different elevations.
Offset
A fitting that connects two ducts that are parallel without changing elevation.
S Cleat
An S-shaped clip used along the long sides of ducts to join them. The cleat
prevents air loss at points where ducts connect.

Duct System Diagram
This diagram shows the interrelationships between the various components of a duct system, including the supply and return
sides, as well as the various fittings and transitions used throughout.
Supply Side
Distributes conditioned air from the
furnace to the living spaces.
Return Side
Brings air back to the furnace to be
reconditioned.
Connections
Various fittings and transitions
ensure proper air flow throughout
the system.

Noise Reduction and Heat Loss Control
Duct liners are frequently used to reduce sound and minimize heat transfer. Fibreglass — since it can withstand high temperatures and is an effective sound barrier — is the most frequently
used material. The materials used vary with the levels of sound. Specifications for the installation must be followed.
Acoustical Liners
An effective acoustical or thermal liner must be continuous, without gaps. Build-outs help
anchor the material. The build-outs must also have insulation.
Types of Liners
•Flexible liners (blankets)
•Exterior insulation
•Semi-rigid boards
Always install the black side of the duct liner toward the air stream. High-velocity ducts may
have an internal perforated metal liner to further protect the fibreglass.

Flexible Duct Connectors
Flexible duct connectors are used in HVAC systems to reduce noise. Noise is transmitted from fans and blowers into the ductwork of a typical system.
Flexible connectors — typically made of fabric — absorb the vibration to reduce or prevent noise transmission.
Connector FabricDescription
Polyester with PVCCommonly used in HVAC, Economical
Fibreglass with hypalon coatingUsed in rooftop units and outdoor air handling applications where
weatherproofing is a must
Fibreglass with neoprene coatingUsed in high velocity, high pressure duct systems, Resists acids and toxic
fumes
Fibreglass with silicone or urethane coatingReplaces asbestos for high-temperature applications

Add-on Devices
Add-on devices such as humidifiers, cooling coils, and air cleaners can affect the flow of air in the return or supply system.
Humidifier
Add-on devices that introduce water
vapour into the air, increasing the
relative humidity in the building.
Operation may be based on
evaporation, vaporization, or
atomization.
Cooling Coil
Devices used in conjunction with
blowers to air condition a home. In
residential applications, often an add-
on device, installed into the supply-side
plenum and using the air moving
potential of the blower.
Air Filtration Devices
Normally located upstream from
humidifiers to prevent them from
becoming wet (especially important for
electronic air cleaners). May be placed
in the outside air intake, or in the return
plenum or duct.

Air Flow in the Duct System
Building comfort depends on air flow. Several factors influence operation of the air flow system. These include the building
itself and its heating or cooling load, the duct system, and the air handling unit moving the air through the ducts.
Building Factors
The structure, insulation, and heating/cooling
requirements of the building affect air flow needs.
Duct System
The size, layout, and components of the duct system
determine how efficiently air can move.
Air Handling Unit
The capacity and settings of the blower determine
how much air can be moved through the system.
System Balance
Each of these factors is dependent on the others. It is
not possible to alter one aspect of the system without
causing changes in the overall operation.

Air Pressure Readings
Gauge PressureAmount by which pressure of air, or of a fluid, exceeds the
ambient atmospheric pressure. Used to express pressures inside
a closed system. Expressed in pounds per square inch gauge
(psig) or Pascals (Pa).
Absolute PressureThe level of pressure above a perfect vacuum. Equal to gauge
pressure plus atmospheric pressure. Expressed in pounds per
square inch absolute (psia) or kilopascals (kPa).
Atmospheric PressureUsed to measure atmospheric pressure. A test tube is placed
opening down in an open dish of mercury. With a perfect vacuum
in the tube, atmospheric pressure on the surface of the mercury
forces it up the tube.
Water ColumnVery small pressure changes are expressed in inches of water
column (w.c.) or Pascals (Pa), rather than mercury. Since the
pressure in forced-air systems is very low, most measurements
use these units.

Calculating Air Flow
You must consider a number of factors to calculate air flow in a building. These factors include the velocity of the air, the
volume of air moving through the ducts, and the effect of friction from ducts and fittings on the air flow.
Velocity
The speed at which air moves from
one point to another, typically
measured in feet per minute
(ft/min) or meters per minute
(m/min).
Volume
The amount of air moving through
the system, typically measured in
cubic feet per minute (cfm) or cubic
meters per hour (m³/h).
Friction
The resistance to air flow caused by
the duct system and its
components, which affects how
much air can be moved by the
blower.

Volumetric Air Flow
You must know the volume of air flow in order to ensure the system moves enough air
to provide the required air changes per hour. Air flow is ordinarily measured in cubic
feet per minute (cfm). It may also be measured in cubic meters per hour (m³/h).

## 1.08 

Constant
Used in air flow calculations for heating
systems

Air Velocity
Air velocity is the speed at which air moves from one point to another. Air velocity is an important part of air circulation. Proper air circulation is important since it prevents temperature stratification and drafts.
Calculation Formula
To find the velocity, divide the air flow rate (in cfm) by the area of duct (in ft²), or the air flow rate (in m³/min) by the area
of the duct (in m²).
V = Q/A
Where:
V = air velocity (ft/min or m/min)
Q = air flow rate (cfm or m³/min)
A = area of duct (ft² or m²)
Example
If the blower in a forced-air distribution system moves 1200 cfm of air through a 24 × 12 inch duct:
A = (24 × 12) ÷ 144 = 2 ft²
V = 1200 ÷ 2 = 600 ft/min

Duct System Pressures: Static
Pressure
Static pressure is air pressure in a duct, at right angles to the direction of air
flow. In the diagram, a manometer connection is positioned perpendicular to
the walls of the duct and, therefore, senses only the outward or static pressure.
Measurement
Measured using a manometer
with a connection perpendicular
to the duct wall.
Importance
Static pressure is a key factor in
determining the resistance that
the blower must overcome.
Units
Typically measured in inches of water column (w.c.) or Pascals (Pa).

Duct System Pressures: Velocity Pressure
Velocity pressure is the air pressure in a duct that parallels the direction of air flow. The weight and velocity of the air creates it.
However, measuring velocity pressure without also measuring static pressure is difficult; therefore, calculate velocity pressure
by subtracting the static pressure from the total pressure.
Direction
Velocity pressure acts in the
direction of air flow.
Calculation
Velocity pressure = Total
pressure - Static pressure
Measurement
Requires special equipment to
measure accurately.

Pitot Tube for Pressure Measurement
The use of a special device called a pitot tube, which has two concentric tubes, can make velocity
pressure measurement easier. The hole in the center tube senses total pressure, and holes on the
outer tube sense static pressure.
Construction
Two concentric tubes with specific openings to measure different pressures.
Center Tube
The hole in the center tube senses total pressure (static + velocity).
Outer Tube
Holes on the outer tube sense only static pressure.
Connection
The pitot tube outlets are connected to an incline manometer or other pressure measuring
instrument.

Using a Pitot Tube in Duct
Systems
The pitot tube tip must point directly into the air stream. To obtain accurate results, the
reading must be taken at least ten duct diameters downstream from elbows and five
duct diameters upstream from other obstructions that might cause swirls or eddies.
Position the Pitot Tube
Insert the pitot tube into the duct with the tip pointing directly into the air stream.
Connect to Measuring Device
Connect the pitot tube to an inclined manometer or digital manometer.
Take Readings
Record the pressure readings, ensuring you're far enough from obstructions
for accurate measurements.
Calculate Results
Use the readings to calculate velocity pressure and air velocity.

Digital Manometer for Pressure Measurement
A dual port digital manometer can be connected to a pitot tube for pressure measurements. The digital display shows the measured
pressure and can calculate velocity directly.
Digital Display
Shows pressure readings directly in digital format.
Dual Ports
Allows for simultaneous connection to both the total and
static pressure ports of a pitot tube.
Automatic Calculation
Many digital manometers can automatically calculate
velocity from pressure readings.
Precision
Provides more accurate readings than analog devices,
typically to 0.01 inch w.c.

Air Velocity Calculation
You can determine air velocity by measuring the velocity pressure and by using the following formula to derive the velocity: V = 4005 × √Pv
Formula Components
V = Air velocity (in ft/min)
Pv = Velocity pressure (in inches w.c.)
4005 = Constant
Example Calculation
To determine the air velocity wherein the measured velocity pressure is 0.02 inch w.c.:
V = 4005 × √0.02
V = 4005 × 0.1414
V = 566 ft/min

External Static Pressure
External static pressure is any resistance to air flow from outside the furnace casing, caused by
ductwork or even from the factory-supplied filter in an air handling device.
Definition
The resistance to air flow that the blower must overcome, excluding the internal components
of the furnace itself.
Sources
Ductwork, filters, dampers, grilles, registers, and other components outside the furnace casing.
Importance
Manufacturers design air flow in furnaces, fan coils, and air handlers based on total external
static pressure (TESP).
Typical Limits
A typical furnace is designed to operate at a maximum of 0.50 inch w.c. of external static
pressure as stated on the rating plate.

Static Pressure Drop (Friction Loss)
Static pressure drop is the decrease in air pressure as a result of friction between the air moving through a duct and the internal surfaces of the duct. The difference between static pressure at two points in a duct is the friction loss that has occurred in that duct section.
Calculation Formula
To calculate the total static pressure drop, use the following formula:
TPD = (L/100) × DPD
Where:
L = Length of the duct section (in ft)
DPD = Design static pressure drop, in inches w.c.
TPD = Total static pressure drop for the duct section, in inches w.c.
Example
If a duct is 140 ft long and the duct section has a design static pressure drop of 0.08 inch w.c.:
TPD = (140/100) × 0.08
TPD = 1.4 × 0.08
TPD = 0.112 inch w.c.

Static Pressure Drop in Duct Fittings
Static pressure drop is greater through fittings and transitions than it is through a piece of straight
duct of the same size. To correctly determine static drop in a system, consult a table of equivalent
lengths.
Equivalent Length
The length of straight duct that would create the same pressure drop as a particular fitting.
Example
A universal boot 10 inches wide generates a static drop equivalent to a 10-foot straight section
of 10 inch duct.
Importance
Accounting for fittings is crucial for accurate system design and troubleshooting.
Reference Tables
HVAC professionals use tables of equivalent lengths to calculate the total pressure drop in a
system.

System Pressure Drop
The system pressure drop refers to the total static pressure drop over an entire system,
including the drop through all duct sections, fittings, transitions, and accessories such as
filter or coils.
Total System
Includes everything that adds resistance to the air flow.
Parallel Sections
Not used to size the blower as there are often parallel sections of duct, and these
parallel runs would not create accumulated (series) resistance.
Design Considerations
When designing a system, you must account for the pressure drop to ensure the
blower can overcome it.
Measurement
Can be measured directly or calculated from individual component pressure drops.

Total Pressure Drop
When sizing a blower for a forced-air distribution system, it is necessary to find the supply duct section with the highest static pressure drop and
the return duct section with the highest static pressure drop.
Identify Critical Path
Find the supply duct section with
the highest static pressure drop.
Identify Return Path
Find the return duct section with
the highest static pressure drop.
Calculate Total
Add the two static pressure drop
values together to find the total
static pressure drop against
which the blower has to work.
Select Blower
Choose a blower that can
overcome this total pressure drop
while delivering the required air
flow.

Static Pressure Test
Testing the static pressure of the entire ductwork can provide valuable information about the "health" of the system. The test is
similar to a blood pressure test to determine the health of a person's veins and arteries.
Required Equipment
•A sensitive pressure measuring device such as an incline
manometer, magnehelic gauge, or digital manometer
•A static pressure tip or probe
•A 3 feet (1 m) length of 3/16 inch (5 mm) plastic tubing
•A 3/8 inch (9 mm) metal piercing drill bit
Static Pressure Tip
These tips are angled and have a 4 inch insertion depth with
four radially drilled 0.040 inch sensing holes. The magnetic
flange and painted arrow ensure proper orientation and allow
hands-free use.

Conducting a Static Pressure Test
Locate Test Points
Find appropriate places to drill test holes on the supply side (+) between the furnace and the coil, and on the return side (-)
between the filter and the furnace.
Drill Test Holes
Use a 3/8 inch drill bit, being careful to avoid coils, tubes, condensate pans, or circuit boards. Never drill into the furnace
cabinet!
Connect Equipment
Connect the static pressure tip to the manometer using the tubing.
Measure Supply Pressure
Insert the tip into the supply side test hole facing the air flow and record the reading.
Measure Return Pressure
Move the connection to the LOW port and insert the tip into the return side test hole.

Calculating Total External Static Pressure
Calculate the system's Total External Static Pressure (TESP) by adding the absolute values of the supply and return static pressure
readings.

## 0.26 

Supply Pressure
Example supply static pressure reading in
inches w.c.

## 0.21 

Return Pressure
Example return static pressure reading in
inches w.c.

## 0.47 

Total Pressure
Total system static pressure in inches w.c.
High Pressure Issues
If static pressure is higher than the design pressure stated on
the appliance rating plate, check for problems with the
ductwork causing low air flow, such as blockage in ducts,
closed dampers, improper transitions, offsets, or kinked flex
duct.
Low Pressure Issues
If static pressure is lower than the design pressure stated on
the appliance rating plate, this may indicate leaking ductwork
or plenums, missing filters, low fan speed, or separated
ductwork.

Air Flow and System Efficiency
Air flow has a major influence on the efficiency of heating and cooling systems.
Cooling Systems
The rule of thumb for cooling systems is that every ton of cooling requires 400 cfm of air flow. For example,
a two-ton cooling system requires 800 cfm of air flow.
Heating Systems
The relationship between air flow and temperature rise can be expressed as follows:
AF = OR / (1.08 × TR)
Where:
AF = Air flow (cfm)
OR = Output rate (Btu/h)
TR = Temperature rise (°F)

## 1.08 = Constant


Measuring Heat Rise
Prepare the System
Replace the air filter and ensure all registers are in the open position.
Operate the Furnace
Run the furnace until it reaches steady-state efficiency, usually 10 minutes. If the furnace has multi-stage firing rates,
operate it at the highest firing rate first.
Measure Return Air Temperature
Record the temperature of air entering the furnace.
Measure Supply Air Temperature
Measure the temperature in the supply air duct at a location close to the supply plenum downstream of any air
conditioning coils.
Calculate Temperature Rise
Subtract the return air temperature from the supply air temperature.

Adjusting for Proper Temperature Rise
Compare to Specifications
Compare the measured temperature rise with the design temperature rise range
specified on the rating plate for the furnace.
The temperature difference should not exceed the range specified by the manufacturer.
Make Adjustments
•If the temperature rise is higher than specified, increase the blower speed to
increase air flow.
•If the temperature rise is too low, decrease the blower speed.
Note: Failure to properly set the air temperature rise may result in damage to the furnace.
If the temperature rise is higher than what the manufacturer specified, the efficiency of
the appliance will drop.

Importance of Proper Air Flow
1
System Efficiency
Optimal air flow ensures the system operates at peak efficiency
2
Occupant Comfort
Proper air distribution prevents hot and cold spots
Equipment Longevity
Correct air flow prevents stress on system components
Energy Consumption
Balanced air flow minimizes energy use

Factors Affecting Fan Capacity
Voltage
The voltage at which a fan
is operating can
significantly impact its
performance. Low voltage
can reduce fan speed and
air flow.
Cleanliness
Dirt and debris on fan
blades can reduce
efficiency and air flow.
Regular cleaning is
essential for optimal
performance.
Motor Condition
The condition of a blower
motor affects its ability to
move air. Worn bearings or
other issues can reduce
capacity.
Duct Configuration
The layout and design of
ductwork near the fan can
create turbulence or
restrictions that affect air
flow.

Common Air Flow Problems
Blockages
Debris, closed dampers, or
collapsed flexible ducts can
restrict air flow.
Duct Leakage
Gaps in ductwork can allow
conditioned air to escape before
reaching its destination.
Improper Sizing
Ducts that are too small create
excessive resistance, while
oversized ducts can cause air
velocity issues.
Dirty Filters
Clogged filters restrict air flow and force the system to
work harder.
Poor Design
Too many bends, long runs, or improper transitions
can create excessive pressure drop.

Troubleshooting Air Flow Issues
Visual Inspection
Check for obvious blockages, damage, or disconnected ducts
Pressure Testing
Measure static pressure to identify restrictions
Temperature Testing
Check temperature rise across the heat exchanger
Flow Measurement
Use an anemometer to measure actual air flow at registers
System Adjustment
Make necessary repairs and adjustments to optimize performance

The fan, or blower, is a crucial component of the air handling system.
Let's explore the various types of electrical and mechanical components
used in HVAC systems, with a focus on blowers, motors, and their
operation.

Types of Fans and Blowers
Direct or belt drive
Different connection methods
between motor and blower
Draw-through or blow-
through
Determines how air moves
through the system
Single outlet or double
outlet
Affects air distribution patterns

Terminology
Blower
Generally used to describe all
devices or device components
designed to move air through
a ducted system
Fan
Used only when it identifies a
type of blower that is
invariably described as a fan
(e.g., axial fan)
Air Moving Device (AMD)
Alternative term used by some manufacturers

Duct Furnace Configuration
Because duct furnaces are typically blow-through, this presentation does not discuss draw-through units (typical of direct-fired
makeup air units) in detail.
Blow-Through Configuration
Common in duct furnaces, where air is pushed through the heat
exchanger
Draw-Through Configuration
Typical of direct-fired makeup air units, where air is pulled
through the system

Choosing and Sizing
Blowers
The blower must be large enough to move the required amount of air
through the system. To choose a blower, the gas technician/fitter must
know:
Required air flow rate
The volume of air needed for the building
Total static pressure drop
The resistance the system presents to air flow

Calculating Static Pressure
Identify Critical Sections
Find supply duct section with highest static pressure drop
Calculate Return Pressure
Find return duct section with highest static pressure drop
Add Pressure Drops
Combine the two calculations to find total static pressure
Select Appropriate Blower
Use blower performance tables to choose correct model

Blower Performance Tables
Blower performance tables indicate the blower wheel velocity and horsepower required to generate the necessary air flow,
given the total static pressure drop.
SP = 249 = KPA

Using Blower Performance

Choose slightly more powerful motor to account for losses
5
Note required RPM of 802
Select motor pulleys according to this requirement

Belt Drive Blower
The cut-off device provides back pressure to the blower wheel
to keep it from freewheeling.
Key Characteristics
Belt drive blowers are connected to the blower motor via a
belt. They are more frequently used on older air handling
systems.
They have four bearings:
•Two on the fan shaft
•Two on the motor

Direct Drive Blower
Key Characteristics
Direct drive blower motors are mounted inside the blower
and linked directly to the blower wheel.
•No belt required
•More compact design
•Less maintenance
•Common in modern systems

Blower Types and Uses
Blowers are divided into two groups, depending on the way air flows through the impeller.
Axial Fans
Air flow is parallel to the fan shaft. These can move large
quantities of air and are often used in situations where noise
suppression is not a priority.
Types include:
•Propeller
•Tube-axial
•Vane-axial
Centrifugal Blowers
Air moves perpendicularly to the shaft. The blower is usually
enclosed in a scroll-shaped casing rather than a straight
casing like the axial fans.
Blade types include:
•Straight
•Curved forward
•Curved backward
•Airfoil shape

Duct Furnace Blower Types
Blower types for duct furnaces are typically single outlet, double inlet. Air can be drawn in from both sides of the blower and
discharged through a single outlet.
Single Outlet, Double
Inlet
Common configuration for
duct furnaces, allowing air
to be drawn from both sides
Typical Installation
Shows how the blower is
positioned within the duct
furnace system

Axial Fans: Propeller Type
Characteristics
Propeller fans are usually mounted over an outlet in the wall.
With little or no ducting attached, they are typically
mounted in areas where large quantities of air need to be
moved against low static pressure.
•Simple design
•Low static pressure applications
•High volume air movement
•Minimal ducting required

Axial Fans: Tube-Axial Type
Characteristics
Tube-axial fans are mounted in a tube just large enough to
clear the blades. They are more efficient than a propeller fan
since they produce a more useful static pressure range.
•Higher efficiency than propeller fans
•Better static pressure capabilities
•Suitable for ducted applications
•More focused airflow

Axial Fans: Vane-Axial Type
Characteristics
All axial fans output air in a spiral pattern. The vane-axial fan
outputs air into a set of vanes, thus straightening the air flow
and increasing the efficiency of the fan.
•Highest efficiency among axial fans
•Straightened airflow pattern
•Better for applications requiring directed air
•More suitable for complex duct systems

Centrifugal Blowers
Key Characteristics
In centrifugal blowers, the air moves perpendicularly to the
shaft. The blower is usually enclosed in a scroll-shaped
casing rather than a straight casing like the axial fans.
•Air enters through a side inlet
•Leaves through a rectangular or square outlet
•Can move large quantities of air at high static pressure
•Requires greater horsepower as static pressure increases
•Motor must overcome start-up inertia

Centrifugal Blower Blade Types
Forward-Curved Blades
Most common in residential
applications for both heating
and air conditioning. Less
efficient but inexpensive and
operate at a wide range of
static pressures.
Backward-Curved
Blades
Slightly less efficient than
airfoil blowers but move about
twice as quickly as forward-
curved ones, requiring larger
shaft and bearings.
Airfoil Blades
Most efficient centrifugal
blowers, consisting of 10-16
blades of airfoil contour.
Usually only used in large
systems where efficiency helps
reduce costs.
Tubular Centrifugal
Installed in straight-line ducts
where centrifugal efficiency is
required but duct
configuration suggests an axial
fan.

Forward-Curved Blades
Characteristics
•Can overload the motor if static pressure increases
•Inexpensive
•Slow-moving, so bearings and shafts are small
•Can operate at a wide range of static pressures
These are the blowers used most commonly in residential
applications, for both heating and air conditioning.

Backward-Curved Blades
Characteristics
•Slightly less efficient than airfoil blowers
•Move about twice as quickly as forward-curved ones
•Require larger shaft and bearings due to higher speeds
•Better efficiency than forward-curved designs
•More suitable for commercial applications

Airfoil Blades
Characteristics
Airfoil centrifugal blowers are the most efficient of the
centrifugal blowers. They consist of ten to sixteen blades of
airfoil contour, curved away from the direction of rotation.
•Air leaves the impeller at a velocity less than the tip
speed
•Usually only used in large systems
•Greater efficiency helps reduce costs in large industrial
operations
•Highest initial cost but best long-term efficiency

Tubular Centrifugal Blowers
Applications
You can install these blowers in straight-line ducts. They are
sometimes installed where the efficiency of a centrifugal blower is
required, but duct configuration would suggest an axial fan.
•Combines benefits of centrifugal and axial designs
•Works well in straight duct configurations
•Provides higher pressure capabilities than standard axial fans
•Specialized application in commercial and industrial settings

Blower Speed and Air Volume
Direct Relationship
The speed of the blower and the volume of air that it moves have a
direct relationship
Adjustment Methods
Adjusting blower speed is one way to remedy insufficient air
delivery
Pulley Replacement
Replacing the motor pulley can help adjust blower speed on older
belt drive appliances
Temperature Effects
Changes in air movement correspond to changes in temperature
rise across the heat exchanger

Pulley Adjustments
Adjustable Pulleys
Some motors come with adjustable pulleys. Adjusting the
pulleys will change the blower speed and, therefore, the
volume of air that is moved and the temperature rise across
the heat exchanger.
•Moving the adjustable pulley in and out raises and lowers
the belt
•Smaller motor pulley = lower rpm, less air, increased
temperature rise
•Larger motor pulley = higher rpm, more air, lower
temperature rise
Do not adjust beyond design specifications as this could
damage the motor or system.

Motor Speed and Rotation
Determining Motor Speed
To determine the speed of a motor in rpm, you need to know
the number of poles of the motor and its frequency.
The greater the number of poles, the slower the rpm.
Formula: S (rpm) = (hertz × 120) ÷ number of poles
Examples
Two-pole, split-phase motor:
S = (60×120) ÷ 2 = 3600 rpm
Four-pole, split-phase motor:
S = (60×120) ÷ 4 = 1800 rpm

Blower Speed Laws
CFM and RPM
The cfm varies directly with the
blower revolutions per minute (rpm)
Pressure and RPM
Static pressure and total pressure
vary with the square of the blower
rpm
Horsepower and RPM
Horsepower varies directly with the
cube of the blower rpm
Practical Application
These relationships help technicians
calculate the effects of speed
changes

Example: Speed Increase Effects
50%
Speed Increase
Blower rpm increases from 500 to 750 rpm
50%
CFM Increase
Air volume increases from 5000 to 7500 cfm
125%
Pressure Increase
Static pressure increases from 1 to 2.25 inches w.c.
238%
Horsepower Increase
Power requirement increases from 2 to 6.75 hp

Drive Ratio
In belt-driven blowers, the drive ratio is the relationship between the
motor pulley size and blower pulley size. The drive ratio multiplied by the
rpm of the motor equals the rpm of the blower.

## 3.5 inches8 inches(3.5÷8)×1725 = 755

Electronically Commutated Motors (ECM)
Modern Motor Technology
Most modern appliances are now equipped with a variable
speed electronically commutated motor (ECM).
The ECM is a brushless DC motor that offers several
advantages:
•Uses less energy
•Delivers more torque than PSC motors
•Offers more control over air flow and velocity
•Requires a microprocessor control board

ECM Control Programs
Soft Start
Motor ramps to 50% initially, then after a set period increases to
100%
Responsive Operation
Automatically changes air volume in response to firing rates,
back pressure, or temperature rise
Soft Stop
Motor slowly ramps down when thermostat is satisfied, then
stops after a set time period
Customization
Technicians can change the program using dip switches
to adjust air flow capacities

ECM vs. PSC Motors
PSC Motor Characteristics
•Starts immediately at 100%
•Stops immediately when thermostat is satisfied
•"Hard start and hard stop" can cause heat stress to heat
exchanger
•Delivers high humidity air at cooling start-up
•10-50% efficiency depending on speed
ECM Advantages
•Soft start and stop reduces heat exchanger stress
•Increases fuel efficiency during heating
•Better humidity control during cooling
•Maintains 60-80% efficiency across all speeds
•Generates significantly less heat

Service and Adjustments
Numerous problems can cause improper air flow in a building and reduce the comfort of occupants. One way to reduce
problems with air handling is to ensure that equipment undergoes proper servicing on a regular basis.
Regular Maintenance
Proper servicing helps
prevent air flow problems
and ensures system
efficiency
System Inspection
Identifying issues early can
prevent more serious
problems and maintain
occupant comfort

Common Air Flow Restrictions
Return Air Blockage
Openings throughout the
building must not have
blockages. Building occupants
should not position furniture or
other objects directly in front of
return-air registers.
Undersized Ducting
If ducting is undersized, the
system will not be able to deliver
the air changes per hour required
by the building. Velocities
through the ducts will be high if
ducts are too small.
Dirty Air Filtration Device
Dirty air filtration devices are the chief cause of inefficient operation of
heating and cooling systems. Forced-air systems require filtration to
operate safely.

More Air Flow Restrictions
Blocked Cooling Coil
If the cooling coil is blocked,
the air conditioning system
cannot function properly.
Regular cleaning is essential
for efficient operation.
Improperly Positioned
Dampers
When a damper is not closing
or opening as required, it
affects the air flow throughout
the system, creating
imbalances.
Dirty/Clogged Blower
If filtration is maintained properly, the blower should not become
dirty. If it does, you must clean it, and clean and replace the filters as
well.

Servicing Mechanical Components
The components of the blower, including the motor, shaft, and fan, must undergo servicing to ensure efficient functioning of the air
handling system.
Follow Manufacturer
Guidelines
Consult the manufacturer's
manuals for the specific type and
model of blower being serviced
Safety First
Turn the power to the furnace off
at the breaker before servicing the
motor
Prevent Accidents
Lock out and tag the breaker so it
is not turned on accidentally

Servicing Direct Drive Blowers
Check Blower Motor Bearings
Test for excessive movement that indicates bearing wear
Lubricate Bearings
Follow manufacturer's instructions, being careful not to over-lubricate
Clean Blower and Compartment
Remove dust and dirt from vanes and housing
Check Wheel Balance
Ensure the wheel rotates freely and is properly balanced
Inspect Housing
Verify all mounts and screws are tight and secure

Adjusting Direct Drive Blowers
Speed Adjustment Methods
Adjust the air volume by varying the speed of the motor.
Most modern PSC and ECM motors can be adjusted
electrically through:
•Speed controllers with multiple settings
•Different wire leads (speed taps) from the motors
•Control boards with dip switches or jumpers
Standard Wiring Colors
Typical color coding for motor speed connections:
•White = Common
•Black = High
•Yellow = Medium
•Blue = Medium low
•Red = Low
Always refer to manufacturer's instructions when wiring.

Control Board Adjustments
Using Dip Switches
Some appliances come with blower control units as either
part of the furnace control board or separate Tap Select
Interface Boards with select switches or jumpers to change
the speed and/or operation sequence of the blower motor.
Always turn off power before making adjustments and wait
at least 1 minute before restoring power after changes.

Control Board Switch Settings

Servicing Belt Drive Blowers
Check Belt Condition
Remove the belt and inspect for wear, cracks, and splits in the
rubber
Inspect Motor Bearings
Test for excessive movement that indicates bearing wear
Examine Blower Wheel Bearings
Check for movement that could indicate worn bearings or
loose collars
Lubricate Components
Follow manufacturer specifications for proper lubrication

Belt Identification and Replacement
Belt Sizing System
The size of belts used in belt drive motors is indicated in the
belt's model number:
•First number equals the width in 1/8 inch increments
•Letter describes belt strength
•Final number is the diameter
Example: Belt numbered 4L-35 is:
•4 = 1/2 inch wide (4 × 1/8 inch)
•L = light duty (for fractional horsepower motors)
•35 = 35 inches in diameter
Replacement Tips
•If the blower uses two belts, replace both
•If only one belt is replaced, the new belt will take more
load and wear out quickly
•Ensure proper tension after installation
•Check pulley alignment when installing new belts

Pulley Alignment
Checking Alignment
If pulleys are not correctly aligned, the sides of the belt will
wear more quickly than usual.
1.Place a straight rod across the grooves of the motor and
blower pulleys
2.If grooves do not line up, loosen shaft set screw
3.Move motor pulley until it is aligned with blower pulley
4.Tighten motor pulley set screw and recheck alignment
If the set screw is jammed or rusted, loosen the mounting
bolts on the motor and slide it backward or forward until the
pulleys are properly aligned.

Belt Tension
Proper Tension
Push down on the belt halfway between pulleys. The belt
should move approximately 3/4 inch.
The belt tension required varies depending on the type of
bearings used:
•Sleeve bearings or combination: 3/4 to 1 inch deflection
with moderate force
•Roller bearings: Belt may be as tight as can be adjusted
by hand
Final Checks
•When tension is correct, tighten motor mount
•Check all blower housing and motor mounts for
tightness
•Tighten any loose parts
•Verify proper operation after adjustment
