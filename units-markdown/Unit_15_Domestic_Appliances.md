Natural Gas Manifold
Typical outlet pressure in inches w.c. (0.9-1.25 kPa)
10
Propane Manifold
Typical outlet pressure in inches w.c. (2.5 kPa)
The regulator is usually pre-adjusted for use with the type of gas specified on the rating plate and for a specific outlet pressure. Many
ranges come with a regulator that is adjustable for use with propane or natural gas.

Code Requirements
Electrical Connections
Most gas ranges require electricity to power clocks, timers,
and other control devices. The electrical connection is usually
120 V 60 Hz, two-wire, with ground. The minimum size and
type of wire that can be used for a 120 V, 15 A indoor appliance
is No.14 AWG NMD-90.
Piping Connections
The Code requirements for gas range piping and tubing
connections can be found in CSA B149.1, which will be
referred to as the Code.
Rigid piping or flexible connectors may be used to connect
ranges to the gas supply. Metal (flexible) connectors must be
installed in accordance with Code requirements.

Electrical Connection Requirements
1
Proper Connections
All electrical connections between
an appliance and the building
wiring must comply with
applicable electrical codes.
Connection of all electrical devices
associated with the appliance
must follow the manufacturer's
wiring diagram.
2
Power Supply Cord
A range must be connected to the
electrical circuit receptacle by
means of an approved power
supply cord with a three-prong
grounding plug. Extension cords
may not be used.
3
Grounding
Under no circumstances should
the grounding prong of a power
supply cord be removed or
replaced with a two-prong plug or
adapter.

Flexible Connector Requirements
Protection
Connectors must be protected from potential damage.
No Passing Through Barriers
Connectors must not pass through walls, floors, ceiling, or partitions.
Connection Requirements
Connectors must be connected to rigid pipe or tubing in the same area as the
appliance, with a shut-off valve located in the same room as the appliance.
Safety Considerations
A gas-fired appliance (range) must not be installed or operated in any location
where it could create a hazard.
A gas-fired appliance (range) must not be installed in a room where corrosive
vapours may damage the appliance or its venting system.

Prohibited Practices
Defective Pipe Sections
Defective sections of pipe or tubing must be replaced and not repaired.
Improper Fittings
Bushings must not be nested (installed within one another).
Fittings with both left- and right-hand threads, thread protectors, or running threads
must not be used.
Concealed Piping Issues
Concealed piping runs must not contain a union or combination of fittings intended to
act as a swing joint.
Field bending of piping is not permitted.
Electrical Concerns
Gas piping and tubing must not be used as an electrical ground.
Piping and tubing must not be used in lieu of electrical wiring, except for a low voltage
control circuit, ignition circuit, or flame detection device circuit incorporated into an
appliance.

Flexible Metal Connectors
Purpose
To provide for movement of the gas range in order to clean behind it, use a certified flexible metal gas connector as
the final connection to the manifold.
Certified flexible metal connectors are tested and certified for multiple bends and expansion, ensuring they will not
crack or incur damage as a result of repeated movements.
Usage Conditions
The length of the connector must not exceed 6 feet (2 m).
When used to connect the appliance to rigid piping, a shut-off valve must be installed in the piping immediately
upstream of the flexible connector.
The gas valve must be in the same room as the gas-fired equipment and the connector must not be concealed within
or run through any wall, floor, or partition.

Commercial Gas
Connectors
Flexible connectors certified for use on commercial ranges that are
moved regularly for cleaning have additional outer protective coverings
of stainless-steel braided wire and antimicrobial PVC coating. They also
have swivel connections to further reduce stress at the ends.
When the commercial equipment is on rollers or wheels, it requires a
restraining cable 25 mm shorter than the flexible connector.

Facilitating Repairs
Flexible Connector
Install a flexible connector to allow movement of the appliance
Shut-off Valve
Install a shut-off valve upstream and as close to the appliance as
practical
Quick-Disconnect Device
Attach a quick-disconnect device to the flexible connector
Restraining Cable
Install a restraining cable, which can have clips for removal that only
get removed after the gas has been shutoff and the connector has
been disconnected

General Installation Considerations
Installation Requirements
Follow specific installation requirements, including
manufacturer's instructions
Levelling
Ensure the range is properly levelled
Anti-tipping Devices
Install anti-tipping devices as required
Restraining Device
Use restraining device for commercial cooking appliance
on wheels
Clearance to Combustibles
Maintain proper clearance to combustible materials
Power Supply
Ensure proper power supply and polarization

Consequences of Improper Installation
Fire or Explosion Hazards
Improper installation can lead to dangerous fire or explosion risks
Personal Injury or Fatalities
Serious injuries or deaths can result from installation errors
Operating and Service Problems
Poor installation leads to ongoing operational issues
Failure to follow the manufacturer's instructions may result in these serious consequences, highlighting the importance of
proper installation procedures.

Specific Installation Requirements
Proper Positioning
Compliance with clearance to combustibles requirements, in accordance with
manufacturer's instructions, the rating plate, and applicable Codes
Access
Access for cleaning, repairs, and servicing
Venting
Proper distance to venting hoods, flues, or ductwork, if installed
Adjacent Fixtures
Proper positioning with respect to adjacent cabinets, countertops, and other
appliances
Never install a range in a bedroom because it might produce carbon monoxide.
However, you may install it in a bed-sitting room if you will not use it as a space heating
appliance.

Levelling and Anti-Tipping Devices
Levelling
If a range is not levelled, fluids will not fill the cooking
containers properly. This may lead to overflow and spillage
that could create a fire or personal injury hazard.
Anti-Tipping Devices
Some ranges may come with anti-tipping devices. These
devices, installed at the time of installation, prevent
accidental tipping of the range. The devices may consist of a
chain connecting the range to a wall bracket or of a rigid
bracket attached to the back of the range and secured to the
wall behind it.

Clearance to Combustibles
Standard Requirements
Different types of ranges have
different clearance requirements. For
example, storage cabinets and other
combustibles must be installed at a
safe distance above the cooking top
of a range, while the rear and side
walls of the range may be approved
for zero clearance.
The manufacturer's instructions and
rating plate specify the approved
clearance to combustibles distance
for the appliance.
Code Requirements
Where not covered in the
manufacturer's instructions or on the
rating plate, follow Code appliance
clearance requirements. For
example, if not specified by the
manufacturer, a range would require
a minimum of 150 mm of clearance
on its back and sides from
combustible surface.
Protection Requirements
Combustible cabinets or walls
located next to a range cooking
surface must be protected with a 28
MSG metal shield, spaced out 0.25
inch (6 mm) from the combustible
surface and extending from 5 inches
(125 mm) below to 30 inches (750
mm) above the cooking surface.

Zero Clearance Range
Requirements
ItemRequirement
Combustibles aboveThere must be no combustibles
within 30 inches (750 mm) of the top
of the range.
Combustible surfaces reductionCombustible surfaces protected by a
shield of 0.25 inch (6 mm) millboard
covered with 28 GSG (0.3 mm) sheet
metal may be within 24 inches (600
mm) of the top of the range.
Space between the back of the range
and a combustible surface
There must be at least a 1 inch (25
mm) space between the back of the
range and a combustible surface.

Power Supply and Polarization
Check Line to Neutral Voltage
Use a voltmeter set to measure AC volts. Check the voltage across the line
and neutral conductors at the range receptacle. The meter should read 120
V, ±10%.
Check Line to Ground Voltage
Next, check the voltage across the line and ground conductors. The
meter should read 120 V.
Check Neutral to Ground Voltage
Finally, check the voltage across the neutral and ground conductors.
The meter should read 0 V.
Readings that differ from those above indicate that the circuit or receptacle
wiring is incorrect or defective and must be corrected before the range is
installed.

Fuel Conversion
Reasons for Conversion
Conversion from one fuel to another may be required for a
number of reasons, including the following:
•Natural gas may become available in an area previously
serviced only by propane.
•A natural gas appliance may be purchased for use in an
area where only propane is available.
Regulator Types
Three common types of gas pressure regulators are shown
in the image. Each one has a different method for converting
from one gas to another. It is important to ensure that an
appliance regulator is adjusted to operate with the gas being
used.

Piping Installation
Connection
The piping connection for ranges
must be done so that the
components are easily accessible
for servicing.
Branch Piping
The size of the pipe or tubing
should be large enough to provide
adequate flow. See Unit 8
Introduction to piping and tubing
systems and Unit 10 Piping and
tubing systems for industrial and
commercial applications for
information on proper pipe and
tubing sizing methods.
Dirt Pocket Exemption
The piping or tubing of a final drop
serving a range does not require a
dirt pocket. Clause 6.13.1 b) of CSA
B149.1 exempts a gas stove, among
other appliance types, from
requiring a drip or dirt pocket at the
end of the piping drop because the
pocket would be inaccessible
behind the stove.

Ranges must be connected to the gas supply with piping, tubing, or other means, as discussed in the Installation requirements section. If not properly
sized, flexible connectors, swivels and quick connects will cause excessive pressure loss to the gas supply. Make sure to use manufactures guidelines
to properly size the connectors.

Regulators and Orifices
Regulators
An appliance regulator is used to reduce the gas supply
pressure to the operating pressure of the appliance. The
regulator must be adjusted for the gas being used, and the
burner must have the proper orifice to ensure that:
•the appliance input is correct; and
•the proper flame characteristics are maintained.
Burner Orifices
An orifice is a hole or opening used primarily to control the
direction and volume of gas flow into a burner. The size and
design of an orifice depend on the following factors:
•the type of gas;
•the appliance input; and
•manifold pressure.

Types of Orifices
Fixed Orifice
The fixed orifice [Figure 1-6(a)] is the most common type of orifice. It is simply a hole
drilled in a brass spud (burner fitting).
The gas's angle of approach to the orifice hole varies with the type and purpose of the
burner.
Adjustable Orifice
Some ranges have orifices that can be manually adjusted to increase or decrease the
flow of gas through the orifices [Figure 1-6(b)].
Cap or Universal Orifice
The cap or universal orifice [Figure 1-6(c)] is used primarily on dual-fuel (propane and
natural gas) appliances.
This orifice requires only a simple adjustment to burn either fuel. When the hood is
screwed in, gas will only flow through the fixed drilled needle (propane setting).
When the hood is screwed out, gas will flow through the needle and around it through
the orifice in the hood.

Orifice Sizing
Sizing Standards
A gas orifice is sized using tables based on an orifice sizing
formula. The size of an orifice is designated according to
DMS drill numbers. DMS stands for Drill Manufacturer's
Standard.
Sizes range from:
•No. 80 (the smallest) to No. 1; and
•A through Z (the largest).
Selection Process
An orifice is selected as follows:
1.The required gas flow rate through the burner orifice is
determined from the information on the appliance's
rating plate using the formula: flow rate in cu ft/h = rated
input in Btu/h + 1 000 Btu/cu ft for natural gas or 2 500
Btu/cu ft for propane.
2.The required burner manifold pressure is determined
from the information on the appliance's rating plate.
3.The correct pressure column is located on the orifice
capacity table and traced down to the required flow rate
value.
4.The correct size orifice to use is indicated in the orifice
column at the far left of the flow rate value row.

Leak Testing and Removing Old Appliances
Leak Testing
After installing an appliance and before reactivating it,
check the piping and connections for leaks. Leak testing
methods are covered in detail in Unit 8 Introduction to
piping and tubing systems, Chapter 2. Code requirements
for testing.
Removing Old Appliances
Follow this procedure before either permanently removing
an existing range or installing a replacement:
1.Locate and identify the gas shut-off on the branch piping
that supplies the range.
2.Shut off the gas supply to the range and any other
appliances attached to the same branch piping.
3.Disconnect the range from the gas supply.
4.Use thread dope and a properly fitting pipe cap to secure
the gas pipe opening. If the shut-off valve is accidentally
opened, an improperly capped pipe could allow gas to
accumulate in the building and an explosion could result.

Operating and Supply Pressure Testing
Residential Pressure Standards
For residential and light commercial installations, natural
gas manifold operating pressure at the burner,
downstream of all control valves, is typically 3.5 inches
w.c. (0.9 kPa). The rating plate shows the correct
manifold pressure.
Normally, natural gas supply pressure at the outlet of the
gas meter or system regulator should be 7 inches w.c.
(1.75 kPa). Typical propane pressure is 11 inches w.c. (2.74
kPa) at the inlet. The rating plate shows the correct
manifold pressure.
Pressure Testing Instruments
Two basic pressure measuring instruments are used in
the gas industry:
•a water-filled manometer; and
•a bourdon-tube pressure gauge.
The manometer is usually more accurate since normal
gas pressure, which is measured in inches of water
column, is relatively low. Manometer operation is covered
in detail in Unit 2 Fasteners, tools, and testing
instruments, Chapter 4. Measuring tools.

Pressure Gauge Operation
Connect to Pressure Source
The gauge is connected to a pressure source.
Bourdon Tube Expansion
The pressure forces the bourdon tube in the gauge to expand.
Mechanical Action
The expansion of the tube acts on a system of gears and linkages
to move the indicator on the gauge dial.
Reading the Measurement
The gauge is calibrated so that the value of the pressure being
measured will be indicated on the dial in inches of water
column, or ounces per square inch (osi) or kPa.
A pressure gauge is more convenient to use but is not as reliable and accurate
as a water manometer.

Pressure Testing Points
Gas Meter Outlet
Testing the pressure at the outlet of the gas meter
Appliance Inlet

Manometers and pressure gauges can be used to test pressures at various points in a gas supply system.

Manometer Connection
Methods
The image shows the manometer connection method for determining
inlet pressure upstream and downstream of the combination control
valve.
Digital electronic manometers are also used today to determine accurate
pressure measurement in inches of water column as well as other scales.

Flex Connectors
Used for final connection to appliances

Shut-off Valves
Selection Considerations
The location and installation requirements for control and
shut-off valves are specified in the Code. In addition to Code
requirements, the gas technician/fitter must take the
following factors into consideration when selecting the
proper valve for the application:
•the location where the valve is to be installed;
•valve gas flow and pressure capacity;
•ready access for repairs and servicing; and
•ensure that the shut-off valve will be readily accessible.
Valve Connection
The size of a valve generally determines the method of its
connection to the gas system:
•Medium-size valves generally have threaded
connections.
•Smaller valves, used with copper tubing, are connected
with flare fittings.

Flare Fittings and Flex Connectors
Flare Fittings
Brass flare fittings are used to join copper tubing.
Connections between copper tubing and steel pipe are
made with threaded-to-tubing adapter fittings.
Although short- and long-neck forged flare nuts are
acceptable for natural gas or propane installations. Short-
neck forged flare nuts are preferred because they are
stronger.
Flex Connectors
The Installation requirements section of this Chapter
discusses the Code and installation requirements for flexible
connectors.

Electrical Requirements
Circuit Rating

wiring and components are
rated for the circuit voltage
and current values and the
operating requirements of
the appliance
Secure Connections
Arrange for safe and secure
electrical connections to
the appliance
Code Compliance
Ensure that the installation conforms to applicable Canadian
Electrical Code, Part 1 requirements

Electrical Code Requirements
Receptacle Placement
Each kitchen must have a sufficient
number of split duplex receptacles
located along the wall behind counter
work surfaces and isolated work
surfaces less than 12 inches (300 mm)
long at the wall line so that no point
along the wall line is more than 36
inches (900 mm) from a receptacle
(measured horizontally along the wall
line).
Appliance Access
There must be an electrical receptacle
within safe and easy reach of the
appliance cord -- you may not use an
extension cord.
Receptacle Type
All appliance receptacles must be grounding-type receptacles, able to
accommodate parallel blade attachment plugs.

Top Burners
Figure 1-12(a) shows a typical top burner for a gas-fired range. Figure 1-
12(b) shows the varying burner port designs. The design chosen depends
on the burner firing rate and turndown range.

Thermostatically Controlled Top
Burner
Gas Flow to Tower Flame
When the control knob is turned on, gas begins to flow to a secondary pilot
called the tower flame assembly.
Tower Flame Ignition
The tower flame is ignited by the constant burning pilot flame.
Main Burner Ignition
The main burner lights from the tower flame.
Temperature Control
The control system keeps the utensil contents at the desired set point
temperature.
The thermostatically controlled top burner is equipped with a thermostatically
controlled sensing element and valve. A spring-loaded sensing unit for the
thermostat is located in the centre of the burner.

Top Burner Igniters
Standing Pilot
The standing pilot type of ignition system has a continuously
lit pilot. A standard or HI-MED-LO push-to-turn valve controls
each top burner. When a top burner control valve is turned on
to allow gas flow into the burner, the pilot ignites the gas.
There are three basic designs of top burner pilot igniter
systems:
•one pilot for each burner;
•one pilot for two burners (Figure 1-14); and
•one pilot for all four burners.
When only one pilot is used for more than one burner, flash
tubes are used to direct the pilot flame to each burner.
Electric Igniter
An electric ignition system consists of a spark generation
device, a switch on each burner valve, and spark igniters
(Figure 1-16). Typically, there are two spark igniters, one each
for the left-side and right-side burners. Both sets of burners
have flash tubes that run between a top burner ignition port
and a central spark gap.
When a burner valve is switched on, electric current is applied
to the spark generator and gas begins to flow into the burner.
The gas-air mixture from the burner port flows down the flash
tube, is ignited by the spark, and flashes back to ignite the top
burner ports.

Flash Tube
The flash tube runs from the top burner ignition port to the pilot flame to provide a direct path for the ignition flame.
When the burner control valve is turned on, gas flows out of the burner ignition port and into the flash tube, drawing
combustion air into the flash tube behind it. The gas and air mix as they travel down the tube toward the pilot flame where it is
ignited. The resulting flame "flashes" back to the burner where it ignites the gas at all the burner ports.

Improper Ignition
IfThen
A flash tube fails to light the
burner when the burner is
manually lit and there is no flame
at the end of the tube
There may be too much air in the
mixture.
The top burner will not light off
the pilot, but there is a flame at
the end of the flash burner
There may be too little air in the
mixture or too much gas.
The ignition at the range burner
is delayed
The operator could be burned.
A range has two top pilots
controlled by one adjustment
and they are unequal in size.
The pilot orifices should be
cleaned or replaced.

Electric Igniter
An electric ignition system consists of a spark generation device, a switch
on each burner valve, and spark igniters. Typically, there are two spark
igniters, one each for the left-side and right-side burners. Both sets of
burners have flash tubes that run between a top burner ignition port and
a central spark gap.
When a burner valve is switched on, electric current is applied to the
spark generator and gas begins to flow into the burner. The gas-air
mixture from the burner port flows down the flash tube, is ignited by the
spark, and flashes back to ignite the top burner ports.

Sealed Gas Burners
Design
A sealed gas burner is designed to prevent food or debris
from dropping into the flame itself.
The sealed burner consists of an integrated drip tray, a gas
burner cap. Each burner will also have its own spark igniter.
Components
PartUse
Integrated drip trayCan simply be wiped
clean after cooking is
done

Sealed Burner Benefits and Drawbacks
Benefits
The benefit of this design is that it prevents the burner holes
from getting clogged.
•Prevents food from falling into flame
•Keeps burner ports clean
•Easier surface cleaning
•More consistent flame pattern
Drawbacks
However, because the drip pan is integral to the surface of
the stove, you cannot remove it to be cleaned in the sink or
dishwasher.
•Limited cleaning access
•Cannot remove drip pan
•May require special cleaning products
•More complex to service

Proper ventilation is essential when using gas ranges to maintain good indoor air quality
and remove combustion byproducts.
Energy Efficiency
Modern gas ranges with electronic ignition are more efficient than older models with
standing pilots, reducing gas consumption during idle periods.
End-of-Life Disposal
Proper decommissioning and recycling of gas ranges is important to prevent
environmental contamination from components and refrigerants.

Gas Oven Systems and
Components

Oven Burners
Slotted Port Burner
The slotted port burner is often used
in range ovens and broiler units. It has
a series of thin slots that distribute the
flame.
These burners provide even heat
distribution throughout the oven
cavity, making them ideal for baking
applications.
Ribbon Port Burner
The ribbon port burner has a single,
long slot. An assembly of thin,
straight, and crimped metal strips
produces a solid, continuous flame
along the length of the slot.
Ribbon port burners are used in larger
gas-fired ovens where consistent,
high-output heating is required.
Figure 1-18: Different types of oven
burners used in gas ranges

Oven Ignition Systems Overview
Match-lit
Requires manual lighting with a
match; flame from main burner
lights standby pilot
Constant Pilot
Continuously burning pilot flame
that ignites the main burner
when needed
Millivolt Pilot
Uses a thermopile heated by
pilot flame to generate voltage
for control circuit
Spark-ignited
Electric spark ignites the pilot or main burner directly
Hot Surface Igniter
Silicon carbide element heats up to ignite gas directly
Capillary tubes are commonly used in oven thermostats to sense the oven temperature and cycle the system on and off as
needed to maintain the oven thermostat setting.

Capillary Pilot System Fundamentals
How Capillary Systems Work
Some systems have a capillary with its
liquid-filled bulb placed in a pilot
flame. These sensor bulbs verify the
existence of a pilot flame rather than
cycling the burner.
The only function of these pilot
sensing elements is to stop gas flow to
the burner if the bulb does not get
heated by the pilot.
Operation Principle
When the liquid inside expands and
exerts pressure onto the diaphragm,
this movement can either open a valve
or close a switch.
This safety mechanism ensures gas
only flows when a pilot flame is
present, preventing unburned gas
from accumulating.
Figure 1-19: Diagram showing capillary
pilot system components and
operation

Match-lit Ignition System
Open Oven Door
The oven door is opened,
and a lighted match is held
to the end of the flash tube
running between the burner
ignition spud and the pilot
flame.
Turn On Control Valve
The oven control valve is
then turned fully on to start
gas flow to the burner and
standby pilot.
Ignition Occurs
The gas-air mixture ignites
at the burner when it comes
into contact with the match
flame. The flame travels
down the flash tube to ignite
the standby pilot.
Set Temperature
The thermostat is turned to
the desired cooking
temperature setting. When
the oven reaches the desired
temperature, the oven
burner reduces to a
minimum (bypass) flame
and the pilot remains lit.

Constant Pilot Ignition System
System Components
A constant pilot ignition system consists of:
•Thermostat valve
•Safety gas valve
•Constant/heater pilot
•Mercury sensing bulb
This system is sometimes called standby pilot or expanding pilot.
Figure 1-20: Oven constant pilot components showing the arrangement of key
parts

Constant Pilot Operation
Thermostat Control
The thermostat valve, mounted on the manifold, controls the oven. Gas lines run to the oven burner and one line to the pilot. A
small amount of gas flows continually to the oven constant pilot.
Heat Call Response
When the thermostat calls for heat, gas flows through the thermostat valve to the safety valve at the burner, and gas flow to
the constant pilot increases causing a heater pilot flame.
Mercury Bulb Heating
The flame deflector spreads the heater pilot flame over a mercury-filled bulb. After this bulb is heated, it causes the safety
valve to open.
Main Burner Ignition
The safety valve allows gas to flow to the oven burner. The heater pilot ignites the burner, which continues to operate until the
pre-set temperature is reached.

Constant/Heater Pilot
Pilot Operation
The constant/heater pilot system
uses a flame deflector to spread the
heater pilot flame over a mercury-
filled bulb.
When the thermostat is satisfied, the
heater pilot returns to regular
constant pilot flame until the
thermostat again calls for heat.
Lighting Procedure
To light the constant pilot in the oven:
1.Make sure the oven is turned off
2.Remove the oven racks
3.Hold a lighted match to the
opening in the top of the pilot at
the rear of the oven burner
No pilot adjustments are required for
this operation.
Figure 1-21: Constant/heater pilot
assembly showing the flame deflector
and mercury bulb

Millivolt Pilot Ignition System
System Overview
A millivolt-pilot ignition system
employs a standing pilot to heat a
thermopile as well as light the main
burner. If the pilot generator is
heated, voltage will be generated
to operate the control circuit.
Operation Principle
Gas flow to the burner is turned on
and off by the control valve in
response to oven temperature
(sensed by the thermostat
capillary tube). When the
thermostat is satisfied, the oven
main burner shuts off, leaving only
the pilot flame.
Safety Feature
If the pilot flame is extinguished, the gas flow is also shut off to the pilot
burner as well, providing an important safety mechanism to prevent gas
accumulation.

Two-level Pilot Spark Ignition
System Operation
The spark ignition system operates
similarly to the constant pilot system,
except that the pilot flame is lit by a
spark and only burns while the oven
control is turned on.
The flame is positioned between the
spark electrode and its target. The
pilot flame actually conducts
electricity, so when the pilot flame is
burning, electricity from the spark
electrode is drained off to ground and
sparking stops.
Safety Feature
If the pilot quits, sparking resumes
automatically, attempting to reignite
the pilot. This provides continuous
monitoring of the pilot flame status.
Figure 1-23: Two-level pilot spark
ignition system showing the spark
electrode arrangement

Spark Ignition System Operation
Oven Activation
When the oven is turned on, a switch mounted to the oven
thermostat signals the spark module. Gas first flows to the low
flow constant pilot.

At the same time as gas flows to the low flow pilot, the capacitive
discharge igniter produces a spark to ignite the pilot. When the
igniter confirms the presence of the constant pilot, gas flows
through the thermostat valve to the safety valve.
Safety Valve Operation
The gas flow to the constant pilot increases, causing a heater pilot
flame. The flame deflector spreads the heater pilot flame over the
mercury-filled bulb, which causes the safety valve to open.
Main Burner Operation
The safety valve allows gas to flow to the oven burner. The heater
pilot ignites the burner, which continues to operate until the pre-
set temperature is reached.

Spark Ignition Cycling
Temperature Reached
When the oven reaches the setpoint
temperature, the pilot flame reduces
in size but does not go out
Ready for Next Cycle
This allows the burner to cycle on in
response to a call for heat without
having to re-ignite the pilot each time
System Shutdown
Once the oven control is turned to
off, the main burner and pilot flame
extinguish completely
Next Activation
When the oven is turned on again,
the entire ignition sequence restarts

Constant Pilot with Flame Switch System
System Components
Both the flame switch system and the hot surface ignition system use a 110V solenoid
operated oven safety valve. The valve is normally held closed by a spring, then opened when
the solenoid is energized.
The flame switch ignition system employs a pilot sensing bulb and capillary to close a switch
rather than opening a valve.
Figure 1-25: Flame switch system components showing the arrangement of the pilot sensing
bulb and capillary

Flame Switch System Operation
Pilot Lighting
The constant pilot is manually lit. The pilot flame heats the switch capillary,
causing it to close its electrical contacts.
Thermostat Activation
When the thermostat temperature setting knob is turned to the desired
temperature, the circuit connecting the thermostat to the flame switch and
solenoid valve is completed.
Valve Operation
The energized oven safety solenoid valve opens to allow gas flow to the oven
burner where the pilot flame ignites the gas instantly.
Temperature Cycling
When the oven set point temperature is reached, the circuit opens, closing the
oven solenoid valve that, in turn, shuts off the gas supply to the burner. The on-
off cycle continues until the thermostat is turned OFF.

Hot Surface Igniter System
System Overview
A hot surface or glow-bar ignition system eliminates the
need for a pilot flame in the oven. It operates on standard
household current of 120V AC and lights the oven burner
electrically with a silicon carbide igniter.
Silicon carbide is very brittle so the glow bars are housed
within a protective cage. There are two different types of
ignitors in common use: round and flat. Their resistances are
different, so the gas safety valve that each uses is different,
but the operating principle is the same.
Figure 1-26: Hot surface igniter showing the silicon carbide
element in its protective cage

Hot Surface Igniter Operation
Thermostat Call for
Heat
When the thermostat calls
for heat, the cycling contacts
close, and the hot surface
igniter is energized.
Igniter Heating
As current begins to flow,
the igniter starts to heat and
its resistance decreases. As
the igniter resistance
decreases, the current flow
through the low resistance
coil of the bimetal valve
increases.
Valve Opening
The bimetal valve will not
open until the igniter has
reached gas ignition
temperature. The gas valve
opens, and ignition occurs
when the amperage in the
circuit has increased to the
point that approximately 4V
are developed across the
bimetal valve's heater coil.
Cycling Operation
When the oven temperature
reaches the thermostat
setting, the thermostat
cycling contacts open and
the electrical circuit is
broken. The igniter cools and
the bimetal valve closes,
shutting off gas flow to the
main burner. This cycling
action repeats until the
thermostat is turned off.

Direct Spark Ignition (DSI) Systems
System Overview
In this system, there is no 'pilot'.
Instead, the spark directly ignites
the gas burner (hence the name),
and the electronic control monitors
its performance.
Operation Sequence
When the range control calls for
either bake or broil, the DSI module
electronically checks both gas
valves' solenoids for continuity. If
the checks are successful, the
module will power the appropriate
gas valve so it can open and initiate
sparking at the burner ignitor.
Safety Features
Both the bake and broil ignitors will
spark simultaneously. Once gas has
ignited, the flame sensing circuitry
will monitor the flame at the burner
as long as it is powered to make
sure that it is present. If at any point
no flame is detected, the DSI
module will lock out the system.

Extinction Pop
What is Extinction Pop?
Extinction pop or flashback can occur
when the burner is turned off. Even
after gas flow to the burner is shut off,
primary air can still flow into it. When
this occurs, the gas-air mixture in the
burner is replaced by air only.
Cause and Effect
During this time when the gas
pressure quickly decreases, the
burning velocity can exceed the flow
rate of the gas-air mixture and
flashback results. The small flashback
explosion or "extinction pop" is not a
hazard but may be annoying.
This phenomenon is common in gas
burners but does not represent a
safety hazard.

Oven Controls Overview
Modulating Controls
Older systems were of the modulating (throttling)
type and used a constant-on burner
Cycling Controls
Newer systems are cycling (on-off) types that turn the
burner completely on or off
Temperature Sensing
The oven heat control system is activated by changes
in temperature to control gas flow to the oven burner
Safety Features
Modern controls include multiple safety mechanisms
to prevent gas accumulation

Cycling Oven Control System
System Components
A typical cycling oven heat control system consists of:
•Oven thermostat and temperature sensing probe that
controls heater pilot operation
•Constant pilot that lights the heater pilot
•Heater pilot that controls safety valve operation
•Safety (cycling) valve that controls main burner
operation
•The oven burner
Figure 1-27: Cycling oven control system showing the
relationship between components

Cycling Control Operating Sequence
Constant Pilot
The constant pilot, located
at the base of the oven
burner, always remains on.
Thermostat Activation
When the oven thermostat
dial is turned on and
adjusted to the desired
temperature, the thermostat
supplies gas to the heater
pilot.
Safety Valve
Operation
The heater pilot heats the
capillary tube or bimetal
element of the safety valve.
Within 60 seconds, the
safety valve opens to allow
gas flow to the main burner.
Burner Ignition and
Cycling
The pilot system ignites the
main burner as soon as gas
starts to flow. When the
thermostat senses that the
desired temperature has
been reached, the pilot
flame reduces back to the
standby rate, shutting off
the safety valve and gas flow
to the burner.

Oven Thermostat
Function and Operation
The oven thermostat (gas thermostat)
is the main component of the cycling
control system. A gas thermostat is a
hydraulic control device that responds
to expansion and contraction of a liquid
contained in the oven probe bulb.
A capillary tube connects the probe
bulb to the thermostat. This device
opens a valve in the thermostat to
increase gas flow to the pilot when heat
is required and closes the valve to
reduce gas flow when the desired
temperature is reached.
Additional Functions
The oven thermostat also provides a
positive shut-off for the main burner
gas supply (manual gas valve). The
oven burner gas supply passes through
the shut-off portion of the thermostat
to ensure that no gas flows to the
burner when the thermostat dial is
turned to the off position.
The thermostat can be set to operate
on natural gas or propane, and it can be
adjusted (with the calibration screw) to
increase or decrease the temperature.
Figure 1-28: Oven thermostat selector
showing the dial and internal
components

Safety Valve
Function
The gas safety valve controls gas flow
to the oven main burner. It is usually
located in the bottom rear area of the
oven, attached to the oven cabinet or
to a bracket extending from the
burner.
Operation
The safety valve contains a diaphragm
mechanism that is controlled by the
action of the pilot flame on a liquid-
filled bulb. The liquid in the bulb
expands or contracts in response to
the amount of heat it receives from
the pilot flame.
The valve diaphragm opens and closes
to control gas flow to the burner,
ensuring gas only flows when safe
conditions exist.
Figure 1-29: Safety valve showing the
diaphragm mechanism and liquid-
filled bulb connection

Set-back Controls
Purpose
Set-back controls reset the oven
cooking temperature to a lower
"hold and serve" temperature.
This feature allows food to be
kept warm without continuing to
cook at the higher temperature.
Heat Motor Types
Bellows type: Has an electrically
heated, fluid-filled bellows
mechanism built into the
thermostat. When the cooking
cycle is finished, a pair of
contacts in the oven timer close
to energize the set-back control
circuit.
Bimetallic Type
The bimetallic heat motor operates similarly to the bellows type, except
that the bimetallic element is heated instead of the bellows. Typically, the
bimetallic heat motor only reduces the temperature to 155°F (86°C) below
the cooking temperature.

Additional Set-back Control Types
Mechanical Turndown
The mechanical turndown consists of a
small, low-revolutions per minute (rpm)
electric motor connected to the oven
thermostat spindle by a series of gear
wheels.
When the cooking cycle is completed,
the switch mechanism of the oven
timer energizes the electric motor. The
motor then rotates the gear wheel
mechanism, which turns the
thermostat temperature control dial to
170°F (77°C).
Substitute Thermostat
This type of set-back control uses two
separate thermostats:
•One thermostat is adjustable for
setting cooking temperatures
•The second (substitute) thermostat
is set to maintain only 170°F (77°C)
When the cooking cycle is completed,
the oven timer mechanism switches
over from the cooking thermostat to
the substitute thermostat, which
maintains the oven at 170°F (77°C).
The mechanical turndown system uses
gears to physically rotate the
thermostat dial to a lower setting.

Self-Cleaning Oven
Cleaning Cycle Initiation
After the clean cycle is initiated, the radiant broiler burner heats the
oven to approximately 650°F (340°C). The oven door then locks
automatically.
High Temperature Phase
When the cleaning temperature is reached, a disc thermostat
(thermodisc) senses when the oven temperature reaches 650°F
(340°C) and switches electrical power from the radiant broiler
burner to the oven burner, which further heats the oven to
approximately 950°F (510°C).
Cycle Completion
At the end of the cleaning cycle (typically two hours), the oven
cools down and the door unlocks when the oven is at a safe
temperature.

Programmable Clocks
Cook and Off
When the clock and thermostat are set to the cook and off
program, the oven will operate at the set point temperature
for the length of time required. When the cooking cycle is
finished, the oven shuts off and cools down to room
temperature.
Cook and Hold
When the clock and thermostat are set to the cook and hold
program, the oven will operate at the set point temperature
for the length of time required. A short time before the
cooking cycle is finished, a set-back device will reduce the
oven temperature to "hold and serve temperature".
Delay, Cook, and Hold
This program allows the user to pre-set the clock and
thermostat so that the oven will operate automatically
without the user being present. At the pre-programmed
times, the cooking cycle will start, and a short time before the
cooking cycle is finished, a set-back device will reduce the
oven temperature to "hold and serve temperature".
Delay, Cook, and Off
This program also allows the user to pre-set the clock and
thermostat for automatic operation. At the pre-programmed
time, the cooking cycle will start, and when the cooking cycle
is finished, the oven shuts off and cools down to room
temperature.

Oven Control Calibration and Testing
Importance
Accurate calibration and testing of oven controls is a
critical factor in ensuring safe and fuel-efficient range
operation and satisfactory cooking results.
Safety Concerns
If an oven control is significantly out of calibration, the oven
could overheat, resulting in fire, damage to the range, or
personal injury to the consumer.
Calibration Types
There are three basic classes of oven calibration and
testing: mechanical, electromechanical, and electronic.
Regular Maintenance
Regular calibration checks help ensure optimal
performance and safety of the oven system.

Mechanical Adjustments
Types of Adjustments
Mechanical adjustments include such
things as:
•Adjusting the thermostat
temperature by means of its
calibration screw
•Adjusting the thermostat
temperature setting knob
•Standby pilot flame adjustment
•Bypass flame adjustment
Thermostat Calibration
The thermostat calibration screw is
located in the centre of the
thermostat shaft. The calibration
screw is turned clockwise to decrease
the temperature and counter-
clockwise to increase the
temperature.
Some thermostats are not designed to
be calibrated in the field and have
their calibration screw sealed in place
to prevent tampering. These styles
will be adjusted at the back of the
temperature setting knob.
Figure 1-30: Location of thermostat
calibration screw showing different
thermostat designs

Temperature Setting Knob Adjustment
Adjustment Range
An oven temperature setting knob can be
adjusted to increase or decrease the factory
settings over a range of ±50°F (±30°C) in
10°F (5°C) increments.
Adjustment Procedure
1.Turn the knob to the OFF position, and
remove it by pulling it straight off the
thermostat shaft
2.Loosen both screws approximately one
full turn or until the shaft rotates freely
3.Hold the knob handle in place while
turning the shaft in the desired direction
4.Each notch represents a change in the
setting of 10°F (5°C)
5.When the knob has been adjusted to the
desired temperature, tighten both
screws
6.Reinstall the knob by pushing it straight
onto the thermostat shaft
Figure 1-31: Oven temperature setting knob
adjustment showing the adjustment
mechanism

Standby Pilot Flame Adjustment
Purpose
Oven thermostats that control the
flame of a manually lit burner come
with a standby pilot. The thermostat
controls the gas supply to the standby
pilot, which is lit only when the oven
valve is turned on.
The purpose of the standby pilot is to
re-ignite the flame of the oven burner
if it is extinguished for any reason.
Proper Adjustment
The proper length of the pilot flame
depends on its position with respect
to the oven burner flame. A pilot flame
may be from 0.25 to 1 inch (6 mm to 25
mm) in length and should have only a
trace of yellow at its tip.
The pilot flame should not touch any
part of the burner and should ignite
the oven burner within one second.
A properly adjusted pilot flame should
be primarily blue with just a hint of
yellow at the tip.

Bypass Flame Adjustment
Proper Flame Size
The main oven burner
bypass flame should be
adjusted to the minimum
size at which it remains
stable. For most purposes, a
properly adjusted bypass
flame should be the same
size as the standby, with blue
"beads" of flame.
Set Oven Temperature
Turn the oven temperature
setting knob to 350°F
(175°C). Heat the oven up to
350°F (175°C).
Check Bypass State
When the oven has reached
350°F (175°C), check the
burner flame to ensure it has
reduced to its bypass state.
Turn the oven temperature
setting knob to 250°F
(120°C) to ensure that the
thermostat valve is
completely closed, and that
the burner flame will remain
in bypass mode.
Make Adjustment
Use the correct tool, in
accordance with the
manufacturer's instructions,
to adjust the bypass flame.

Electro-mechanical Adjustments
System Components
Electromechanical adjustments and
tests are sometimes required on electric
gas control systems. An electric gas
control system operates on 120V AC and
consists of three main elements:
•The oven thermostat
•A flame switch or silicon-carbide
igniter
•A solenoid valve
Thermostat Testing
To determine if the oven thermostat
requires recalibration:
1.Place a temperature test probe in the
centre of the oven's middle rack
2.Turn on the oven to 400°F (200°C)
and allow it to heat for 15-20 minutes
3.Record the temperatures at which
the burner turns on and off for several
cycles
4.An average temperature within 10°F
(5°C) of the set point is satisfactory
Accurate temperature measurement is
essential for proper thermostat
calibration.

Thermostat Recalibration
Remove Knob
Remove the temperature setting knob assembly
by carefully pulling it straight off the thermostat
shaft. It is important to ensure that the "D" stem
does not rotate; otherwise the original thermostat
setting will change.
Access Calibration Screw
Insert a screwdriver carefully into the calibration
screw slot to adjust. Turn the calibration screw
clockwise to reduce the temperature or counter-
clockwise to increase the temperature.
Make Adjustments
Do not move the "D" stem during these
adjustments. Observe the temperature change on
the test instrument and adjust the calibration
screw as necessary until the desired temperature
is maintained.
Complete Procedure
Make small adjustments and give the oven plenty
of time before making additional adjustments.
When the adjustment is completed, reinstall the
temperature setting knob and turn it to the OFF
position.

Flame Switch System
System Operation
The flame switch is connected in
series with the thermostat and
solenoid valve, and is normally closed
as long as there is a pilot flame. The
solenoid valve cannot open unless the
thermostat and flame switch are both
closed.
Safety Function
The flame switch is a critical safety
device that prevents gas flow to the
main burner if the pilot flame is not
present. This prevents unburned gas
from accumulating in the oven cavity.
Figure 1-33: Flame switch system
circuit showing the electrical
connections between components

Flame Switch Testing
Voltage Test
With the power on, the pilot
burner ignited, and the
thermostat closed, a voltage
test across the flame switch
terminals should indicate
0V. If voltage is indicated,
the switch is defective.
Continuity Test (Hot)
Turn off power to the circuit
and disconnect one wire
from the flame switch
terminals. With the pilot lit
and the flame switch heated
to operating temperature, a
continuity test across the
flame switch terminals
should indicate continuity.
Continuity Test (Cold)
Continuity across the flame
switch terminals when the
unit is cold indicates that the
switch has a short circuit.
This means that the system
will still operate, but the
safety feature will not be
operational.
Replacement
The flame switch requires
immediate replacement if it
is defective, as it is a critical
safety component.

Hot Surface Ignitor (HSI) System Tests
System Operation
The HSI control system is a series circuit similar to the flame
switch system, with the glow-bar wired as the safety instead
of the flame switch. Although the oven safety valve looks
exactly the same as the one used for the flame switch
system, it operates at a much lower voltage.
When the ignitor heats up, the resistance drops, and the
safety valve gets more current. When the voltage drop
across the valve reaches approximately 4V, the safety valve
opens, and the ignitor is hot enough to ignite the gas.
Figure 1-34: Oven HSI control circuit showing the electrical
connections between components

Troubleshooting Non-Glowing Ignitor
Check Ignitor
Resistance
Disconnect or remove
ignitor and measure its
resistance. Cold resistance
should be between 50 and
150 Ohms. (The value of the
resistance is not important
as long as the ignitor is not
open or shorted.)
Check Power Supply
Check internal fuses,
switches and 120V AC power
supply. If power is working,
disconnect oven power and
remove wires at B and D and
check continuity between
wire B and terminal D.
Test Safety Valve
If continuity is not present,
remove wire at C and probe
terminals D and C for
continuity. If no continuity,
replace the oven safety
valve. If continuity is present
at D and C, probe wires B and
C. If no continuity, replace
the ignitor.
Check Thermostat
If continuity is present
between B and D, check the
thermostat. Make sure the
oven is not heated. Turn
power off, disconnect wiring
and turn thermostat dial to
350°F (175°C). Probe at
terminals A and B. If no
continuity, replace the oven
thermostat.

Troubleshooting Ignitor Glowing with No Ignition
Basic Checks
First, check that gas is turned on to the range. Then
check that ignitor mounting screws are tight and the
ignitor is properly positioned with relationship to the
main burner ports.
Amp Draw Test
Check amp draw at oven safety valve with power on
and thermostat set at 350°F (175°C). Using clamp-
on amp meter, test one leg for amp draw at D or C.
•Carborundum (round) Ignitor: 2.5 to 3.0 amps
•Norton (flat) ignitor: 3.2 to 3.6 amps
If amp draw not within proper range, replace the
ignitor. If correct amp draw is present, replace valve.
A clamp-on ammeter is used to measure current
flow through the ignitor circuit without breaking the
circuit.

Solenoid Valve Test
Valve Operation
The solenoid valve, which is
normally closed, opens when it is
energized. To test solenoid valve
operation, observe its opening and
closing action while turning the
power on and off.
Continuity Test
If there is no continuity across the
solenoid coil, and the valve does not
open when the power is turned on,
the valve or its coil must be
replaced.
Gas Flow Test
If any gas continues to flow through
the valve when it is shut and the
power is off, the valve should be
replaced immediately as this
represents a serious safety hazard.

Electronic Adjustments
Digital Controls
Electronic adjustments include such
things as digital oven temperature
controls. These microprocessor-
controlled devices are operated by a
push-button keypad. A digital LED or
LCD window displays temperature
readings, cooking times, etc.
Thermistor Operation
A thermistor is a temperature-sensitive
semiconductor device that has a
negative temperature coefficient,
which means its resistance decreases
as its temperature increases. The
resistance of the thermistor varies non-
linearly with temperature.
Because its resistance increases so
rapidly over a very narrow temperature
range, the thermistor can be used as a
switching device to switch the gas valve
and igniter off and on.
Figure 1-35: Electronic oven control
display showing digital interface

Electronic Oven Control Calibration
Access Calibration
Mode
Depress the BAKE push-
button on the keypad. Turn
the rotary temperature
selection switch to 500°F
(260°C) or higher, then
immediately (within 1
second) depress the BAKE
push-button and hold down
for 5 seconds.
View Current Setting
The display will then indicate
the factory offset setting of
00.
Adjust Temperature
Tap the arrow up or down to
change the oven
temperature as needed. The
temperature can be
increased or decreased
±35°F (±20°C) in 5°F
(±2.5°C) increments. (Some
clocks have a turn dial
instead of arrow pads.)
Save Settings
When the desired
temperature offset has been
selected, depress the
STOP/CLEAR pushbutton to
set and store the new setting
in the controller's memory.
Use a tester to recheck the
oven temperature.

Gas Pressure
Importance
After installing and before servicing a
gas range, check the gas manifold
pressure with a manometer. It must
have gas flowing through in order to
read and adjust its pressure setting
correctly.
If it is incorrect, adjust the regulator to
achieve the correct manifold pressure.
Proper Flame Characteristics
A stable flame with the correct
characteristics is required for proper
combustion and range operation. The
characteristics of a flame depend
mainly on the primary air supply.
A stable, blue flame will be produced
at the burner when the proper amount
of primary air is premixed with the gas
before ignition.
A manometer is used to measure gas
pressure in the manifold to ensure
proper operation.

Primary Air Supply
Effect on Flame
Increasing or decreasing the primary air supply
will change the shape and colour of the burner
flame.
•Increasing primary air: The flame sharpens
and the inner cone gets smaller
•Decreasing primary air: The flame gets
longer and burning speed decreases
because more secondary air is then required
to complete combustion
•Further reduction: A yellow tip appears on
the flame
•No primary air: The flame will become
completely yellow
Adjustment Location
For each of the top burners and oven burners,
the primary air shutter is located at the open end
of the venturi tube and is locked in place.
Should the air shutter need adjusting, loosen the
Phillips head screw and gradually rotate the air
shutter to allow more or less air into the burner
tube as needed.
The air shutter controls the amount of primary
air that mixes with the gas before combustion.

Top Burner Faults
Proper Flame Characteristics
A properly adjusted burner flame
should extend between one and two
inches above the burner ring or grate.
The flame will spread out when a
cooking vessel is placed on the burner.
It is important to ensure that the inner
blue cone of the flame is not broken by a
cooking vessel on the burner. If the
inner blue cone of the flame is disturbed
in this way, the incomplete combustion
that results can produce carbon
monoxide (CO), which is a colourless,
poisonous gas.
Burner Adjustments
Burner adjustments include:
•Gas input adjustment
•Air shutter adjustment to regulate
primary air flow
•Burner and orifice cleaning and
alignment
The correct gas input is indicated on the
appliance rating plate. When the
correct gas input to the range is
verified, you can adjust the orifice hood
of each burner to maintain the correct
gas-air mixture for proper combustion.
A properly adjusted top burner flame
should be steady, blue, and have a well-
defined inner cone.

Oven Burner Faults - Temperature Issues
Oven Too Hot
Possible causes:
•Standby pilot set too high,
preventing burner from cycling off
•Heat control sensing bulb broken
or leaking
•Heat control out of calibration
•Thermostatic valve dirty
Corrective actions include adjusting
the standby pilot, replacing the
sensing bulb, recalibrating the heat
control, or cleaning/replacing the
thermostatic valve.
Baking Takes Too Long
Possible causes:
•Burner underfired, causing
excessive preheat time
•Heat control out of calibration
Corrective actions include increasing
the orifice size or recalibrating the

Proper diagnosis of oven burner
issues requires systematic testing of
components.

•Thermostat not properly calibrated
•Safety switch not closing
Corrective actions include repositioning
or cleaning the oven bulb, recalibrating
the thermostat, or checking safety
switch operation.
Temperature stability issues often relate
to thermostat or sensing bulb problems.

Broiler Burner and Pilot Issues
Broiler Will Not Come On
When the thermostat is set to "Broil"
but the broiler burner will not come
on, check the aerated pilot to ensure
it:
•Is ignited
•Is hard and about 1/2 inch long
•Reaches above pilot shield
•Flows around the capillary of the
flame switch
Also check the pilot adjusting screw to
make sure it is open.
Other Possible Causes
•Orifice dirty or incorrectly sized -
Check orifice for correct size; if
correct size, clean orifice
•Air supply tube restricted - Check
for foreign material, kinks, or loose
fittings
•Restricted vents - Check and clear
vents
The broiler burner is typically located
at the top of the oven cavity and
requires proper air and gas flow for
operation.

Upper Oven Broiler Pilot Issues
Pilot Goes Out
If the upper oven broiler burner pilot
gas goes out, check for:
•Pilot flame too small - Check
whether adjusting screw is open
enough to provide maximum flame
•Air supply tube blocked or out of
alignment - Check air tube for
restriction and proper location
(approx. 1/2-5/8 inch from the
oven burner box)
•Incorrect orifice size - Check pilot
orifice size and replace if incorrect
Other Factors
•Oven bake burner overfired -
Adjust orifice
•Vent passages blocked - Clear
blocked vent passages
The broiler pilot must maintain a
stable flame to ensure proper ignition
of the broiler burner.

Mercury Safety System Issues
Burner Will Not Turn On
If the burner will not turn on and
mercury is not glowing bright red,
check for:
•Dirty pilot - Clean pilot orifice
•Defective pilot - Replace pilot
•Oven control set to LP when it
should be set for natural gas
Rapid Cycling
If the burner cycles rapidly (every 1-2
seconds) after it reaches setpoint, the
regulator may be failing to lock up,
causing the heater pilot to surge when
main burner goes out.
Corrective action: Clean or replace
regulator disk and seat.
Other Issues
If the pilot does not expand when
control temperature is set, the clock
may not have been reset (may have
been activated while cleaning). Set to
manual operation.
If the pilot expands and heats mercury
bright red, but burner fails to ignite,
the mercury safety is defective and
should be replaced.

Carbon Monoxide Safety
Potential Hazards
A gas range can produce
carbon monoxide when
large containers of fluid are
heated over a long period
of time. Carbon monoxide
can form when a gas flame
impinges on the cold
bottom of a container.
Warning Signs
Determine if the customer
is experiencing any
symptoms of carbon
monoxide poisoning, such
as headache or nausea,
while operating the range.
Prevention
Ensure proper burner
adjustment and ventilation.
The inner blue cone of the
flame should not be
disturbed by cooking
vessels, as this can lead to
incomplete combustion
and CO production.
Installing carbon monoxide
detectors near cooking
areas provides an
additional safety measure.

Environmental Considerations
Component Disposal
After tests prove a component to be
faulty, it should be removed in
accordance with the manufacturer's
instructions. Potentially hazardous
materials, such as mercury-filled
capillary devices, must also be disposed
of in accordance with applicable
environmental legislation.
Replacement Parts
When installing replacement
components, ensure they are correct for
the application in terms of part number,
type, size, and rating. Always consult the
manufacturer's instructions for the
component part number and other
necessary specifications.
Proper disposal of components,
especially those containing mercury or
other hazardous materials, is essential for
environmental protection.

Verification After Service
Operational Check
Verify that the appliance is in
proper working order after any
service work
Control Calibration
Ensure all control components
are properly calibrated
Thermocouple Output
Check thermocouple output if
applicable to the system
Oven Thermostat
Verify oven thermostat
calibration is accurate
Gas Leak Check
Test for gas leaks at fittings or
other connections
Ignition System
Confirm proper ignition system
operation
Flame Characteristics
Check flame characteristics for proper combustion

Clearance Requirements
Domestic Dryers
•Above: 6 inches (150 mm)
•Front: 24 inches (600 mm)
•Back and sides: 6 inches (150 mm)
Note: Manufacturer's certified clearances
marked on the nameplate typically take
precedence and may be reduced.
Commercial Dryers
•Above: 18 inches (450 mm)
•Front: 18 inches (450 mm)
•Back and sides: 18 inches (450 mm)
These clearances are specified in CSA
B149.1 Clause 7.5.4 for domestic dryers
and Clause 7.4.2 for commercial dryers.
The rating plate on the clothes dryer
specifies the clearances required between
a gas-fired appliance and combustible
material. Check the Code for specific
requirements for dryers, and consider
them before installing the dryer.

Gas Supply Piping Requirements
Material
The Code states that all
gas piping must be
steel, copper, or plastic.
Re-used piping must
be cleaned, inspected,
and tested to ensure
it's equivalent to new.
Size
Piping must be large
enough to provide the
required amount of gas
needed by the
connected appliances.
Consider future
additions when sizing.
Location
The Code specifies
where gas piping,
tubing, connections,
and fittings may or may
not be placed. Protect
from traffic and
weather.
Joints
All pipe jointing
sealants must have
certification.
Appliances must not
place stress on piping
or connections.

Manual Shut-off Valves
Required Installation
All appliances must have manual shut-off valves installed. These
valves need to be readily accessible.
Proper Placement
The Code specifies the type of manual shut-off valve required, as
well as where it must be placed.
Identification
If the valve for the clothes dryer is not installed in the drop to
the dryer, or within a few feet of the dryer, there must be a
metal tag attached to the valve or a permanent sign placed
next to the valve, indicating the appliance it serves.

Flexible Connectors
Connector Types
Flexible metal connectors are the most
common connection method for clothes
dryers. These provide some flexibility in
positioning the appliance while
maintaining a secure gas connection.
Hose Restrictions
Hoses may only be used with an unvented
appliance, and they are therefore not
permitted to be used for connection to a
dryer.
Flexible connectors must be certified for
use with gas appliances and installed
according to manufacturer specifications
and code requirements.

Moisture Exhaust Duct Requirements
Outdoor Venting Required
The dryer must be exhausted to the outdoors to
prevent lint buildup indoors, which is a fire hazard, and
to prevent high moisture levels within the building.
Vent Material
The vent material must be either non-combustible or
certified as meeting the requirements for Class 1 air
ducts specified in ULC CAN-S110. Plastic vents are
only acceptable if they have been stamped with this
number.
Prohibited Connections
Do not connect a moisture exhaust duct into a vent
connector, vent, or chimney. The exhaust vent must
also vent clear of combustible materials.
Termination Distance
Maintain a termination distance of 1 metre (m) away
from regulator vents or fresh air intakes. Commercial
clothes dryer requires 3 m clearance from a fresh air
intake.

Proper Vent Installation
No Sheet Metal Screws
Do not use sheet metal screws to secure a moisture exhaust duct. If
screws are used, they may catch lint in the outlet, which can cause
blockages and fire hazards.
Use Duct Tape
Use duct tape to connect the moisture exhaust duct to the dryer. All
joints should also be sealed with suitable tape.
Provide Access
Provide an access for inspection and cleaning of the exhaust system at
least once a year, including the air flow path inside the dryer.
Prevent Lint Buildup
A lint buildup can pose a serious fire hazard as there is a risk of the
burner igniting this lint deposit.

Levelling the Dryer
Prepare the Floor
Check that the legs are not extended. Make sure the locknuts are tight. Slide the dryer onto cardboard or hardboard before moving it across
the floor.
Position the Dryer
Move the dryer close to its permanent location. Leave enough room to connect the exhaust vent. Note the clearance requirements
specified on the rating plate or as specified in the Code.
Check Levelness
Check the levelness of the dryer by placing a level on top of the dryer. Check side to side and front to back.
Adjust Legs
If the dryer is not level, loosen the locknuts and adjust the legs until the dryer is level. Keep the dryer as close to the floor as
possible. All four legs must rest firmly on the floor so that the dryer does not rock when it is operating.
Secure Locknuts
After levelling the dryer, tighten the locknuts securely against the bottom of the dryer base. If the locknuts are not tightened securely,
they will vibrate out of position during operation.

Electrical Supply Requirements
Power Specifications
All gas dryers have a power cord
incorporating a common parallel-
blade plug (three-prong plug) that
will fit into a household receptacle.
This receptacle must supply a
nominal 120 V, 60 cycle current, and
should be within 5 ft (1.5 m) of the
rear of the machine.
Circuit Requirements
It is better if the receptacle used is
on a separately fused (15 A) circuit.
Do not use an extension cord, an
adapter, or a heavily loaded circuit.
Code Compliance
All electrical service to the dryer must conform to local codes and ordinances, as
well as the latest edition of the Canadian Electrical Code, Part 1.

Polarity and Grounding
Three-Prong Grounding Plug
Ensure that the dryer is supplied with
a three-prong grounding plug. This is
for the protection of everyone. It
should be plugged directly into a
properly grounded three-prong
receptacle.
Caution! Never remove the grounding
prong from the plug.
Proper Receptacle
If a mating wall receptacle is not
available, it is the responsibility and
obligation of the customer to have a
suitable grounded three-prong
receptacle installed by a qualified
electrician.
The power cord from the dryer control
housing to the wall receptacle must
maintain proper polarity for safe
operation.

Safe Electrical Installation
Turn Off Power
Before plugging the dryer's power cord
into the wall receptacle, ensure that the
power is turned off at the circuit
breaker or fuse box.
Connect Power Cord
Plug the dryer's three-prong grounding
plug into a properly grounded three-
prong receptacle.
Restore Power
After plugging the dryer in, turn on the
power at the circuit breaker or fuse box.
This is to protect you from electrical
shock if there is a problem with the
electrical circuit.

Fuel Conversion
Conversion Process
Conversions of clothes dryers follow the same
procedure as described for ranges. The process
must be performed by a qualified technician
following manufacturer guidelines and code
requirements.
Inlet Pressure
The typical inlet pressure for a dryer operating
on natural gas is 6 inches w.c. (1.5 kPa) and 10
inches w.c. (2.5 kPa) for an appliance operating
on propane.
The inlet pressure is measured in the piping just
before the appliance. It is measured while the
appliance is firing at its rated input so that the
pressure loss that occurs while the gas moves
through the system can be taken into account.

Making the Gas Connection
Close Manual Shut-off Valve
Before the dryer is connected, close the manual shut-off valve to the piping where the dryer is being installed.
Remove Shipping Cap
Remove the shipping cap from the gas pipe at the rear of the dryer.
Check Gas Type
Check the rating plate on the dryer to see the type of gas it requires. If the dryer needs to be converted, this must be done before it is
connected to the supply.
Apply Joint Compound
Apply a certified pipe-joint compound to the supply pipe and flexible connector joint.
Test for Leaks
Once the installation is complete, perform a soap test on any piping or tubing that was not previously tested.

Testing for Gas Leaks
Turn On Gas Supply
Make sure that the gas supply to the dryer is on.
Prepare Soapy Solution
Use a soapy solution such as a liquid detergent. Only use certified leak testing solution approved for use with gas.
Apply Solution
With a paintbrush, spread some of the solution around all gas joints and connections.
Check for Bubbles
If bubbles are seen, there is a leak. Turn off the gas supply and tighten the connections.
Retest
Check the connections again for leaks. Every time a dryer is serviced, use a soap test to check for leaks.
Clean Up
Always clean the soap solution away after performing a test, as over time this can be corrosive to the piping or tubing.

Pressure Regulators
Function
The pressure regulator on a dryer reduces
the incoming gas pressure and keeps the
pressure supplied to the dryer at a
constant level.
Location
The pressure regulator is typically located
in the gas flow system of the dryer, as
shown in the cut-away view of the controls
and gas flow system.
The balancing pressure of the regulator is
typically set at 3.5 inches w.c. (0.9 kPa).
Variations from this pressure will change
the burner input and can cause the dryer
to fire incorrectly.

Adjusting the Pressure Regulator
Factory Setting
The pressure regulator is adjusted at the factory to provide the correct operating pressure. If someone has tampered with
it, it may need to be adjusted.
Access Test Port
Typically, the 1/8 inch NPT pipe plug on the side of the burner is used to give access to test the pressure.
Turn Off Gas
Turn off the main gas supply before connecting a manometer or test gauge.
Restore Gas Supply
Then turn the gas supply back on.
Adjust Pressure
Adjust the pressure on the regulator up or down as the burner is firing.

Types of Moisture Exhaust Vents
Rigid Metal Vents
Rigid metal vents are preferable as
they are less likely to be crushed. They
provide the most reliable and efficient
exhaust path for moisture and lint.
Flexible Metal Vents
If flexible metal venting is used, then it
must be fully extended and supported
when it is installed on the dryer. It
must not be enclosed in walls, ceilings,
or floors.
Prohibited Vents
Uncertified plastic and foil-covered
vents are not recommended because
this type of ducting can kink, sag, be
punctured, reduce air flow, extend
drying times, and affect dryer
operation.
Note: Do not use a vent with a
diameter less than 4 inches (102 mm).

Exhaust Hood Requirements
Outdoor Venting
In Canada, the exhaust system must be vented to the
outdoors to prevent lint buildup indoors, which is a fire
hazard, and to prevent high moisture levels within the
building.
Hood Installation
The exhaust vent must fit inside the hood. The exhaust
outlet hood should be at least 12 inches (300 mm) from the
ground or any object that may be in the path of the
exhaust.
Minimal Resistance
The termination should present minimal resistance to the
exhaust air flow.
Proper Sealing
Use caulking compound to seal the exterior wall opening
around the exhaust hood.

Exhaust Hood Types
Preferred Hood Types
These hood designs provide optimal airflow and prevent debris or wildlife from entering the vent system while allowing moisture to escape efficiently.
Acceptable Hood Type
This type of hood is acceptable but may not provide the same level of performance as the preferred types. It still meets code requirements for outdoor venting.
Checking Vent Flaps
Vent hoods have flaps that prevent exhaust and wildlife from entering the system. Check that the exhaust hood flapper is not stuck, missing, or damaged in any
way. You can use a mirror to check that the flap is moving freely.

Vent Flap Maintenance
Regular Inspection
When the dryer is on, ensure that the flap is fully open. On an existing system,
check that the exhaust hood is not clogged with lint.
Wildlife Check
Also, check that no wildlife has nested inside the hood. Birds and small animals
often find dryer vents to be attractive nesting locations.
Avoid Magnetic Latches
Caution! Do not use exhaust hoods with magnetic latches. The flapper on the vent
prevents the flap from swinging freely.
No Screens
Never install a screen over the outlet as it will cause lint buildup and blockages,
creating a fire hazard.

Duct Length Considerations
Maximum Length Factors
The maximum length of the exhaust
system depends on:
•Manufacturer's specifications
•Type of exhaust hood
•Type of material (rigid or flexible
metal)
•Number of elbows
Selection Process
Choose the exhaust vent length chart
that corresponds to the type of hood
being used, then select the length
based on the vent material and the
number of elbows needed.
Risks of Excessive Length
Do not use vent runs longer than
those given in the chart. Exhaust
systems longer than these will:
•Accumulate lint, creating a fire
hazard
•Shorten the life of the dryer
•Reduce performance of the dryer,
leading to higher energy costs

427 ft (8.2 m)23 ft (7.0 m)
This is a typical vent length chart for a 4 inch (102 mm) hood. Always
consult the manufacturer's specifications for your specific dryer model.

Ducts in Unheated Areas
Insulation Requirement
If the ductwork runs through an
unheated area, it should be insulated to
prevent condensation from forming
inside the duct.
Proper Slope
The duct should slope downwards
towards the exhaust hood so as to
prevent the buildup of moisture and lint
within the exhaust vent system.
Proper insulation and slope are
essential to prevent moisture problems
that can lead to mold growth and
reduced efficiency.

Routing the Vent
Multiple Routing Options
The exhaust outlet is located at the rear
of the dryer. The exhaust vent can be
routed up, down, left, right, and straight
out of the back of the dryer.
Wall Penetration
When routing through walls, ensure
proper sealing around the vent to
prevent air leakage and maintain the
building's thermal envelope.
Space Considerations
Choose the routing option that
minimizes the number of bends while
maintaining proper clearances and
accessibility for cleaning.

Metal Cutting Tools
Tin Snips
Tin snips are essential for cutting the
metal ducting. Make sure to include
snips that cut to right and snips that
cut to left for different cutting angles.
Important: Never use snips to cut wire
as this blunts the blades on the snips.
Electric Drill
A heavy-duty electric drill is needed to
drill through walls. When selecting a
drill bit, make sure it is sharp. Also
check that the bit shank and chuck
jaws are clean. If they are dirty the bit
may not align properly.
Proper cutting tools ensure clean
edges on metal ducts, which helps
prevent lint accumulation and
improves airflow efficiency.

Clearance to Combustibles for Ranges
Code vs. Manufacturer
Instructions
To determine the required clearance
to combustibles for a range, refer to
the gas code over the manufacturer's
instructions or the rating plate.
This statement is False. The
manufacturer's certified instructions
take precedence over the Code
requirements for clearances.
Zero Clearance Certification
The allowable clearance to
combustibles for a range certified for
zero clearance (without additional
protection) is 600 mm above, 150 mm
at the back.
This is important to understand when
installing ranges in tight kitchen
spaces.
Always verify the specific clearance
requirements for each appliance
model as they may vary based on
design and certification.

Flexible Connectors and Gas Flow
Connector Length and
Capacity
If you have three certified metal
flexible connectors of different
lengths, they will all have the same gas
flow capacity.
This statement is False. The length of
a flexible connector affects its gas
flow capacity. Longer connectors
have more resistance and therefore
lower flow capacity.
Manifold Pressure Testing
When checking the manifold
pressure, there must be gas flowing to
properly read and adjust pressures.
This statement is True. Pressure
readings must be taken while the
appliance is operating to account for
pressure drops during gas flow.
Proper pressure testing ensures the
appliance receives the correct gas
pressure for safe and efficient
operation.

Sealed Gas Burner Design
Burner Port Maintenance
A sealed gas burner design maintains
clean burner ports because the burner
cap collects debris.
This design prevents food and liquids
from entering the burner ports, which
helps maintain consistent flame
patterns and efficient combustion.
Burner Cap Function
The burner cap serves as both a flame
spreader and a protective cover that
prevents debris from entering the
burner ports.
Regular cleaning of the burner cap is
essential to maintain proper burner
performance.
Sealed burners are easier to clean and
maintain than traditional open burner
designs, making them popular in
modern gas ranges.

Oven Temperature Recalibration
Mechanical Style Gas Ovens
For mechanical style gas ovens that
do not have adjustable thermostats,
the oven temperature is recalibrated
by changing the gas orifices.
This allows technicians to adjust the
heat output to achieve the desired
temperature range.
Calibration Timing
A gas range should operate for 15
minutes before adjusting the oven
temperature calibration.
This warm-up period ensures the
oven has reached a stable operating
temperature for accurate calibration.
Proper calibration ensures that the
oven temperature matches the
setting on the control dial, which is
essential for consistent cooking
results.

Proper Burner Flame Adjustment
Flame Height
A properly adjusted burner flame
should extend high enough so that the
inner blue cone of the flame is above
the burner ring or grate, and able to
touch the cooking vessel.
This statement is False. The inner blue
cone should remain below the cooking
vessel for efficient heat transfer and
to prevent incomplete combustion.
Correct Flame Characteristics
A properly adjusted flame should have
a well-defined blue inner cone with a
light blue outer mantle. The flame
should be stable and not lift off the
burner ports.
Correct flame adjustment is essential
for efficient cooking, proper heat
distribution, and safe operation of the
gas range.

Gas Dryer Components Overview
Internal Components
Gas dryers contain several key
components including the burner
assembly, gas valve, pressure regulator,
ignition system, and safety controls.
Burner Assembly
The burner assembly is where
combustion occurs. It includes the
burner tube, igniter, flame sensor, and
related components that work together
to produce heat.
Control System
The control system manages the
operation of the dryer, including
temperature regulation, cycle timing,
and safety monitoring.

Gas Flow System in a Dryer
Gas Inlet
Gas enters the dryer through the supply line connection at the rear of the appliance.
Pressure Regulator
The gas passes through a pressure regulator that reduces the incoming pressure to the appropriate operating
pressure (typically 3.5 inches w.c. or 0.9 kPa).
Gas Valve
The gas valve controls the flow of gas to the burner. It opens and closes based on signals from the control system.
Burner
Gas flows to the burner where it mixes with air and is ignited by the ignition system to produce heat.
Heat Exchange
The heat from combustion is transferred to the air circulating through the dryer drum, which dries the clothes.

Burner Ignition Systems
Spark Ignition
A burner system that lacks a pilot as the gas is ignited
directly by a spark. This system is more energy-efficient
than standing pilot systems as it only operates when heat
is needed.
Glow Coil Ignition
Uses an electric heating element that glows red-hot to
ignite the gas. The glow coil is energized before the gas
valve opens to ensure reliable ignition.
Hot Surface Ignition
Similar to glow coil but uses a silicon carbide or silicon
nitride igniter that heats up more quickly and has a longer
service life.
Radiant Sensor
Detects the heat from either the igniter or the burner
flame. This sensor is part of the safety system that
ensures gas only flows when ignition is confirmed.

Dryer Safety Controls
Thermal Fuse
A one-time safety device that breaks the circuit if the dryer overheats.
Once it blows, it must be replaced.
High-Limit Thermostat
Cycles the heat off if the temperature exceeds safe limits. Unlike a
thermal fuse, it resets automatically when the temperature drops.
Flame Sensor
Monitors the presence of a flame. If the flame goes out, it signals the
control system to shut off the gas valve.
Warp Switch
A safety device designed to break the circuit to the glow coil and pilot
valve when certain malfunctions occur.

Dryer Operation Cycle
Start Cycle
User selects cycle and temperature,
then starts the dryer
Air Circulation
Blower motor starts, creating airflow
through the drum
Heat Generation

Dryer Maintenance
Clean Lint Filter
Clean the lint filter before or after each load to maintain airflow and prevent fire hazards.
Inspect Exhaust System
Check the entire exhaust system at least once a year, including the air flow path inside the dryer.
Remove Lint Buildup
Vacuum inside the dryer cabinet and around the burner area to remove lint accumulation.
Check for Gas Leaks
Perform a soap test on gas connections whenever the dryer is serviced.
Professional Service
Have a qualified technician inspect the dryer annually for proper operation and safety.

Troubleshooting Gas Dryers
No Heat
Check gas supply, ignition system, thermal fuse, gas valve, and flame sensor.
Ensure all electrical connections are secure and the gas supply valve is open.
Insufficient Heat
Inspect for restricted airflow in the exhaust system, check gas pressure, examine
burner for obstructions, and verify thermostat operation.
Won't Start
Check power supply, door switch, start switch, and motor. Ensure the control board
is functioning properly.
Noisy Operation
Inspect drum support rollers, idler pulley, blower wheel, and motor bearings. Ensure
the dryer is properly leveled.

Gas Dryer Safety Precautions
Gas Supply
Always turn off the gas supply before servicing a gas dryer. Use a properly
calibrated gas detector to check for leaks after service.
Electrical Safety
Disconnect the power before servicing. Never bypass safety devices or
operate with panels removed.
3
Proper Ventilation
Ensure the area around the dryer is well-ventilated. Never operate a gas dryer
in an enclosed space without adequate ventilation.
Qualified Service
Only qualified technicians should service gas appliances. Improper service
can create serious safety hazards.

Replacing a Gas Dryer
Assess Compatibility
If replacing an appliance, check to ensure that the new appliance or
replaced parts are compatible with and suitable for the current system.
Energy Type Change
If the new appliance uses a different type of energy to the old one --
such as a different type of gas, or electricity - check that the old
energy supply is safely shut off and sealed.
Testing
When an appliance is installed, perform tests to see that it is
working safely and correctly. Included in these tests are pressure
tests.
User Education
Ensure that the user of the appliance knows how to safely
operate the gas-fired clothes dryer.

Prohibited Practices
Improper Venting
Never connect a moisture exhaust duct into a vent connector, vent, or chimney. This
can cause dangerous backdrafting of combustion products.
Unsafe Connections
Do not use sheet metal screws to secure a moisture exhaust duct as they may catch lint
in the outlet, which can cause blockages and fire hazards.
Inadequate Clearances
Never install a dryer without maintaining the required clearances to combustible
materials as specified in the Code or on the appliance rating plate.
Improper Materials
Do not use uncertified plastic or foil-covered vents for dryer exhaust. Only use
materials that are specifically approved for this application.

Dryer Installation Checklist

connections. Verify that a readily accessible manual
shut-off valve is installed.
Electrical Connection
Confirm proper voltage, grounding, and polarity.
Ensure the outlet is on a dedicated circuit.
Venting
Verify that the exhaust system is properly installed,
using approved materials, and vented to the outdoors
with minimal restrictions.
Leveling
Ensure the dryer is level and all four legs are firmly on
the floor with locknuts tightened.
Testing
Perform operational tests to verify proper functioning
of all components and systems.

Dryer Efficiency Considerations
Proper Venting
An efficient exhaust system with
minimal restrictions allows the dryer
to operate at peak efficiency. Longer
or more complex vent runs reduce
efficiency and increase drying times.
Regular Maintenance
Keeping the lint filter and exhaust
system clean ensures optimal airflow,
which is essential for efficient
operation. A clogged system forces
the dryer to work harder and use more
energy.
Proper Loading
Overloading the dryer restricts airflow
around the clothes, increasing drying
time and energy consumption.
Underloading wastes energy by
heating more air than necessary.

Environmental Considerations
Energy Consumption
Gas dryers typically use less
electricity than electric models but
consume natural gas or propane

Dryer Installation in Multi-Unit
Buildings
Special Considerations
Installing gas dryers in multi-unit buildings presents unique challenges related to
venting, gas supply, and safety requirements.
Venting Requirements
Each dryer must have its own dedicated vent to the outdoors. Common venting systems
are not permitted for multiple dryers due to the risk of lint fires and backdrafting.
Gas Distribution
Gas supply systems in multi-unit buildings must be properly sized to accommodate all
appliances. Individual shut-off valves must be accessible to each unit.
Code Compliance
Additional code requirements may apply to multi-unit installations, including fire
separation, access for maintenance, and ventilation considerations.

Dryer Installation in Confined Spaces
Ventilation Requirements
Gas dryers installed in closets or other
confined spaces require adequate
ventilation to ensure proper
combustion and prevent the buildup
of combustion products.
Door Requirements
Closet doors must have ventilation
openings at the top and bottom to
allow for proper air circulation. The
minimum opening sizes are specified
in the installation instructions and
applicable codes.
Clearance Considerations
Even in confined spaces, all clearance
requirements must be maintained.
This includes clearances to
combustible materials and service
clearances for maintenance access.

Dryer Conversion Between Gas Types
Manufacturer's Kit
Use only the conversion kit specified by the manufacturer for the particular dryer model. Improper conversion can create serious safety
hazards.
Qualified Technician
Conversion must be performed by a qualified technician with the appropriate training and certification.
Component Replacement
Conversion typically involves replacing the pressure regulator spring, gas orifices, and sometimes the burner assembly to
accommodate the different gas properties.
Testing and Adjustment
After conversion, the appliance must be tested for proper operation, including checking gas pressure, burner flame
characteristics, and safety controls.
Documentation
The conversion must be documented with appropriate labels on the appliance indicating the new gas type and date of conversion.

Gas Dryer Installation and
Operation Guide

Wall Preparation for Venting
Standard Walls
To cut a hole through the walls that the venting must pass through,
use a 4.125 inch (100 mm) high-speed hole cutter.
Masonry Walls
For brick or concrete walls, use a masonry bit or coring machine.
Proper venting is critical for gas dryer operation. The vent hole must be
precisely sized to ensure adequate airflow while maintaining a proper seal
around the vent pipe.

Burner Ignition Systems Overview
Constant Pilot
Sometimes referred to as a match-lit, capillary pilot, or standing pilot burner. This
older technology requires manual lighting and maintains a continuous flame.
Glow Coil
Uses a resistance wire mounted on a ceramic block that heats up to ignite the gas
when power is applied.
Spark Ignition
Also called direct ignition, this system ignites gas directly with a spark without using
a pilot light.
Glo-sil
Provides a hotter igniter with faster combustion response, using silicon carbide
elements that heat to high temperatures.

Constant Pilot Burner System
Manual Lighting Required
The constant pilot is an outdated
technology found on older dryers. It
must be manually lit and remains on
continuously once lit.
Mercury-Filled Capillary Tube
The standing pilot heats a mercury-
filled capillary tube bulb; the pressure is
transmitted through the capillary to
keep the spring-loaded shut-off valve
open.
Safety Mechanism
If the pilot goes out, the mercury cools
and the bellows release the spring-
loaded valve to shut off the flow of gas
to the pilot and burner.
This ignition type represents an outdated burner technology and is found on older dryers. A gas technician/fitter is less likely
to encounter this style of ignition as electronic ignition now dominates the dryer marketplace.

Lighting the Constant Pilot
Push Down Start Lever
This lever lifts the pilot valve and latching cap and seals the tube to the main burner. The gas flows into two different tubes: to the
zip tube and the pilot.
Light the Air-Gas Mixture
Light the mixture above the zip tube. The gas lights along the full length of the tube and lights the pilot.
Wait for Heating
Wait while the pilot heats up one end of the mercury-filled capillary tube. As the mercury heats up, it expands and pushes on the
diaphragm attached to the other end of the tube, operating a latching pin.
Release the Start Lever
After about one minute, the pin moves forward into the latched position, holding the pilot gas valve open. You can now release the
start lever.
If the pilot goes out, the latching pin pulls back, shutting the pilot valve and stopping all gas flow.

Main Burner Ignition Sequence
1
Timer Setting
When the timer dial is set to a heat setting, the circuit through
the timer is closed.
2
Thermostat Circuit
This completes a circuit through the thermostat to the main gas
solenoid.
3
Gas Flow and Ignition
Gas can now flow to the burner and be ignited by the pilot.
This sequence ensures that gas only flows to the main burner when both the
timer is set to a heat setting and the thermostat is calling for heat, with the
pilot flame ready to ignite the gas.

Glow Coil Ignition System
System Components
The glow coil is a resistance wire mounted on a ceramic block. It is connected to a step-down
transformer that is mounted on the valve body. When power is applied to the coil, it glows, producing
enough heat to light the gas.
Operation Sequence
As soon as the dryer timer is turned to one of the heat settings, the pilot valve is energized. Power
enters through the 1 V circuit, and the pilot switch is closed at three points simultaneously, allowing
current to flow through multiple paths.
When the glow coil heats up to a brilliant white hot, it ignites the pilot gas. The pilot flame then heats the mercury bulb, creating pressure in the tube leading to the pilot switch.

Glow Coil Electrical Sequence
Power Entry
Power enters through the 1 V circuit
with the pilot switch closed at three
points simultaneously
Multiple Circuits
Connection 4–1 allows current
through pilot solenoid coil and warp
switch; Connection 4-3 allows
current through warp switch heater
and transformer; Holding circuit
maintains pilot solenoid
Ignition
Glow coil heats to white hot and
ignites pilot gas
Pilot Switch Action
Pilot flame heats mercury bulb,
creating pressure that moves the
pilot switch arm, opening 4-1 and 4-3
circuits, and closing the 4-2 circuit

Door Opening Safety Feature
1
Voltage Cut-off
If the dryer door should be
opened at any time during the
cycle, voltage to the main burner
is cut off.
2
Gas Valve Closure
Both the main burner and pilot
gas valves close, stopping gas
flow.
3
Burner Shutdown
Both the main and pilot burners
go out, even though the door is
closed again. (The pilot valve will
not open because of the 800 Ω
resistor.)
4
Cooling Period
After about two minutes, the mercury cools and the
pilot switch moves back to connect 4-1 and 4-3
circuits again.
5
Reignition
The burner ignition steps are then repeated.

Warp Switch Safety Function
Purpose
The warp switch acts as a safety device to break the
circuit to the glow coil and pilot valve when certain
malfunctions occur.
Malfunction Detection
•The main burner does not light at initial start-up
because of interrupted gas supply
•The pilot fails to light
•The pilot flame is faulty and not generating enough
heat to cause the pilot switch to operate
Operation
The warp switch is composed of a bimetal arm that warps
or bends when heat (supplied by the resistance heaters)
is applied to one side of it. If left in the circuit, the warp
switch will open after three to four minutes.
Normal Conditions
Under normal operating conditions, the pilot ignites and
the pilot switch swings to the 4-2 circuit, removing the
resistance heater from the circuit before the warp switch
can react.

Spark Ignition Burner System
The spark ignition burner is sometimes referred to as a direct ignition burner. There is no pilot in this system as the gas is ignited directly by a spark.
System Operation
When voltage is applied to the burner assembly, a circuit is completed from 1 V through
the normally closed flame and igniter switches, the igniter coil, and the normally closed
warp switch to the 3 V terminal. This circuit starts three circuits simultaneously: the
igniter circuit, main coil circuit, and relay coil circuit.
Ignition Process
The igniter assembly consists of a coil, a stationary contact arm, and a movable contact
arm. The movable contact arm is motor actuated by circuitry through the contact points.
The arm oscillates 6 to 12 times a second and is returned to its normally closed position by
a spring. Arcing occurs each time the contacts break to provide ignition.

Spark Ignition Circuit Operation
1
Main Coil Circuit
The circuit from the 1 V terminal, through the main coil and the normally closed warp switch, contacts to the 3 V terminal. Although this
circuit energizes the main coil, no gas flows to the main burner at this time because of the resistor in the pilot coil circuit.
2
Relay Coil Circuit
The circuit from terminal 1 GB through the relay coil and warp switch heater to the 3 V terminal. This circuit closes the
normally open relay switch, which completes a circuit directly to the pilot coil (bypassing the resistor).
3
Gas Flow and Ignition
The increased voltage across the pilot coil provides enough energy to "pull in" the gas solenoid
valve. Gas now flows through to the main burner where ignition occurs.
4
Flame Detection
Within 3 to 5 seconds after burner ignition takes place, the burner flame
heat applied to the heat probe of the flame switch will cause the flame
switch contacts to open. This action opens circuitry to the igniter, relay coil,
and warp switch heater and stops igniter action.

Spark Ignition Safety Features
Warp Switch Protection
Opens circuits to stop gas flow if ignition fails
Timed Safety Response
Calibrated to open between 15-40 seconds
Heat Detection
1000 Ω heater activates the safety response
If, for any reason, the burner flame should fail to ignite or the flame switch should fail to open, heat generated by the warp
switch heater will open the normally closed warp switch contacts. This opens the circuits to the pilot and main burner coils and
stops the flow of gas. Warp switches on spark ignition burner are typically actuated by a 1000 Ω heater and calibrated to open
between 15 and 40 seconds.

Glo-sil Burner System
System Evolution
The Glo-sil type burner was developed to bring a hotter igniter and a much
faster response to combustion in the firing of the dryer burner. It has been
used in production for many years. The "K" series was used until 1984 when
the "M" series was phased into production.
Operation Principles
Although they look different, both function the same way. After the gas
passes through the regulator, it encounters the first of two electrical solenoid
control valves. Both valves are spring-loaded closed, and the solenoids must
be energized for them to open. Both valves must be open for the burner to
work.

Glo-sil Burner Operation Sequence
Power Application
A circuit is completed from the 1 V terminal to the igniter and sensor back to the 3 V terminal. Simultaneously, the hold coil is
energized and the assist coil is energized through the sensor.
Valve 1 Opens
Both the hold coil and the assist coil must have full line voltage applied to lift valve no. 1 off its seat. The igniter is heating, and
valve no. 1 is open.
Igniter Reaches Temperature
When the igniter reaches a temperature hot enough to open the radiant sensor contacts (about 2200°F or 1204 °C), the only
path left is through the valve no. 2 coil. This causes valve no. 2 to open.
Gas Flow and Ignition
Gas now flows through valve no. 2 and is ignited instantly by the hot igniter. Magnetism through the assist coil is reduced.
Magnetism through the hold coil is enough to hold open valve no. 1 open.

Glo-sil Power Interruption Safety
1
Power Failure Occurs
If the voltage to the burner is momentarily interrupted from a power failure
2
Power Restoration
When power is restored, valve no. 2 opens
3
Valve 1 Remains Closed
With the reduced current through the assist coil (now in series with valve
no. 2), valve no. 1 will not open
4
Safety Restart
When the sensor cools and its contacts re-close, ignition will resume
This safety sequence prevents gas from flowing when power is restored after an
interruption, ensuring that ignition only occurs under controlled conditions.

The Glo-sil Igniter
Operating Temperature
The igniter heats to a
temperature of about 2200°F
(1204 °C) in about 15 to 30
seconds after line voltage is
applied to it.
Material Composition
Since it is made from
recrystallized silicon carbide
and is very brittle, take care
when servicing this type of
burner ignition system.
Design Variations
Several different styles have been used, but they all function the
same way.
The silicon carbide igniter is a critical component that must reach precise
temperatures to ensure proper gas ignition. Its brittle nature requires
careful handling during installation and service.

The Radiant Sensor
Mounting Location
The radiant sensor is mounted on the side of the burner tube and controls the
opening of valve no. 2. A cut-out in the funnel allows radiant heat from the igniter and
gas flame to contact the sensor.
Contact Operation
Its contacts are single-pole, single-throw, and are calibrated to open when the igniter
reaches its operating temperature, about 2200°F (1204 °C). Heat from the burner
flame holds the contacts open after ignition.
The radiant sensor plays a crucial role in the safety and operation of the Glo-sil system, ensuring that gas only flows when the igniter is hot enough to provide immediate ignition.

Dryer Controls Overview
Control Panel
Timer, temperature selector, and start switch
Operational Components
Motor, blower, and burner assembly
Structural Support
Bulkhead assembly for drum support
The dryer controls and devices are situated within the dryer bulkhead assembly. The bulkhead assembly is welded or bolted together to
form a rigid support for the drum. The motor, blower housing, and burner are mounted at the base of the bulkhead. The top panel and
console assembly consists of the timer, push-to-start switch, and temperature selector. It may also have a buzzer attached that indicates
when the dryer has completed its cycle.

Drum Motor and Door Switch
Double-Shafted Motor
The motor is the driving force that turns the dryer drum and blower. Dryer motors are double-shafted: a
pulley sits on one end and the blower on the other end. The dryer drum is rotated through a belt drive
system. Idler pulleys are used to keep the belt tight.
Centrifugal Blower
The blower is a centrifugal wheel that supplies the air flow through the dryer. It creates the negative
pressure needed to draw air through the heating chamber and into the drum, then pushes the moist air out
through the exhaust vent.
Every dryer has a door switch that opens the electrical circuit to the motor when the dryer door is opened. A pin on the inner door panel extends through the door latch strike plate opening to operate the switch when the
door is closed.

The Drying Cycle Process
Load Placement
Damp clothing is placed into the
dryer and the control adjusted for a
drying time
Moisture Evaporation
Heat applied by the dryer evaporates
the moisture in the clothing with little
rise in exhaust air temperature
Temperature Increase
As the load becomes drier, less heat
is used to evaporate moisture and the
air temperature starts to increase
Thermostat Regulation
When the temperature reaches a set
point, the thermostat turns off the
gas supply, then turns it back on
when temperature drops

Temperature Controls
User-Selectable Range
Temperature controls modulate the heat within a range selected by the user.
High Limit Switch
There is also a fixed high limit switch that is typically set between 190°F and
250°F (88-121°C).
Air Temperature Sensing
Temperature control switches are actuated by the temperature of the air that
passes across them.
Cycling Operation
When the temperature in the dryer rises above the set point, the switch opens
the circuit to the burner, cutting off the gas supply. When the temperature
reaches the lower set point, the temperature control closes, energizing the
burner circuit.

Dryer Timers
Main Control Function
The timer is the main control
mechanism since it controls the
motor and burner sequence. It is
either a solid-state device, or it
consists of a timer motor and cam
that mechanically opens and closes
circuits in the dryer.
Time-Dry Timers
Time-dry timers have the time
motor operating all the time. Both
the heat source and the dryer motor
are also operating at the same time,
except when the dryer is in the cool
down cycle. In this case, the heat
circuit is open.
Automatic Cycle
The automatic cycle of a dryer also
includes a timer. When the control
is set to AUTO DRY it operates in
the same way as the time-dry timer
except that the timer motor is not
on when the heat source is
operating. A thermostat controls
the switching between the heat
source and the timer motor.

Automatic Cycle Operation
Timer and Heat Alternation
In the automatic cycle, the timer motor is not on when the heat source is operating. The chart
shows the periods when the timer is operating (shaded area). The rest of the time the heating
circuit is closed, and the timer circuit is open.
Drying Time Factors
In the automatic cycle, the drying time depends on four things:
•The amount of run time selected for the timer
•The type and size of clothes loads
•The wetness of the clothes in the dryer
•The ambient temperature and humidity
With auto dry settings, the user can set the control for different cycles depending on the clothing being dried. These settings adjust the drying temperatures, the length of the timer operation, and the
length of the cool down period.

Cool-Down Period
Wrinkle Prevention
Whether set to timed dry or the automatic cycle, there is a cool-down period
when the heat is off. This is just before the end of its timed cycle and is used to
prevent excessive wrinkling.
Extended Operation
The dryer operates for a longer period of time after the clothing is dry, with no
heat being added to the air.
Damp Dry Option
Some dryers allow clothing to be damp dried to prepare the clothing for ironing.
In this case, as soon as the thermostat cycles the heat off, the timer motor
advances to OFF.
Air Fluff Cycle
There may also be an air fluff cycle wherein the dryer operates without heat
being supplied.

Start Switches
Safety Device
All dryers have a momentary
contact start switch that must be
activated for the dryer to operate.
These switches are also called
push-to-start switches and are a
safety device on the dryer.
Motor Start Circuit
The switch is a single-pole, spring-
return in series with the start
windings of the drive motor. It must
be held in momentarily until the
dryer motor reaches approximately
1200 revolutions per minute (r/min
or rpm), and then the centrifugal
switch in the motor closes the
circuit internally.
Circuit Interruption
Should the electric motor circuit be
interrupted from any source - this
includes opening the clothes dryer
door - the drum stops revolving. It is
necessary to push the START
button to start the dryer again.

Dryer Thermostats
Control
Thermostat
Located on the
exhaust vent, it
controls the amount
of heat supplied to the
dryer.
Safety
Thermostat
Wired in series with
the control
thermostat and heat
source. If the heat
rises above about
250°F (121°C), it opens
the circuit to the heat
source.
Cool-down
Thermostat
Measures air
temperature at the
end of a timed cool-
down period. When
the air drops below a
set temperature, it
advances the timer to
the end of its cycle.
These three thermostats work together to ensure proper temperature
control, safety, and cycle completion in the dryer.

Safety Thermostat Function
Negative Pressure Monitoring
The blower creates a negative pressure in the heater box that is monitored by the safety disc (a temperature sensing snap
disc).
Normal Operation
This switch is mounted over a hole in the burner box and normally air is drawn in, keeping the snap disc
cool.
Blockage Detection
When the lint screen or vent system becomes blocked, the negative pressure in the
heater box is reduced and the heat from the burner flows out the hole.
Safety Response
When the safety thermostat senses the increase in temperature, it
shuts off the burners and cycles them until the condition is rectified.

Elements of Proper Drying
Heat
Provided by the burner
Raises temperature to evaporate
moisture
Air Movement
Provided by the blower
Circulates heated air and removes
moisture
Exposure
Enhanced by drum rotation and baffles
Ensures all clothing surfaces contact
heated air
Proper and efficient drying requires these three elements working together. The burner provides heat, the blower provides air
movement, and the speed of drum rotation along with baffles enhance exposure of clothing to the air movement.

Ideal Flame Characteristics
Proper Flame Appearance
The flame should be blue and lively, but not too loud. It
should not be scrubbing the top of the burner cone (funnel)
but should extend to the cone, tailing up slightly.
Importance of Flame Quality
A properly adjusted flame ensures that the air is heated
efficiently and within the set temperature ranges. If it is not,
it can lead to unburned carbon particles dirtying the clothing
in the dryer, as well as the formation of dangerous gases and
dryer inefficiencies.
An ideal clothes dryer flame has no yellow in it, indicating complete combustion with the proper air-to-gas ratio.

Air Requirements for Combustion
Primary Air
The primary air is the air mixed with the gas before ignition.
This air affects the characteristics of the flame. You can
adjust the amount of primary air supplied to the burner by
opening or closing the air shutter. The location of the air
shutter will be included in the manufacturer's literature. It is
normally locked in place with a locking screw.
Secondary Air
The secondary air is the air around the flame during burning.
This air completes the combustion process after the initial
ignition. Proper secondary air flow is essential for complete
combustion and efficient operation.
With the burner operating, loosen the locking screw and gradually slide the shutter open or close it until the flame meets the
manufacturer's suggested flame characteristics.

Flame Characteristics and Problems
Lifting (Blowing)
The flame will look as though it has lifted off the mouth of
the burner. It is caused by either too much primary air, high
gas pressure, or both.
Yellow Tipping
There is a yellow tip on the end of the flame caused by a
shortage of primary air or poor burner design. The fuel gas
is not burning completely, and carbon is being formed.
Yellow Flame
A yellow flame indicates lack of primary air that may be
caused by dirt in the venturi or a maladjusted venturi.
Orange Flashes
Oranges flashes in the flame are caused by dust in the air
and do not indicate a problem with the burner.
Flashback
The flame will appear to have travelled back through the
burner tube to the orifice. This is caused by a low velocity
gas-air mixture.
Lazy Flame
A lazy flame is one that wavers and hits the top of the cone.
This indicates an air flow problem.
Note: Flame characteristics are only a guide. Other checks and tests must be done to confirm the problem.

Air Movement in a Dryer
Air Intake
The blower draws air in through the access panel at the bottom of the dryer, creating negative pressure in the heater box.
Heating Process
About 30% of this air is pulled into the combustion chamber and heated by the gas burner, then passes up the back of the dryer through a duct, into the diffuser.
Air Mixing
The rest of the air (approximately 70%) is pulled up through vents into the diffuser and mixed with the hot air.
Drum Circulation
The mixed hot air passes through perforations in the drum, which has baffles to tumble the clothes so the heated air can pass through them.
Exhaust Process
The blower pulls the moist air out through the perforations in the front of the drum, through a lint trap, and pushes it out the exhaust duct to the outdoors.

System Efficiency Requirements
Proper Drum Sealing
The front and rear of the drum must be properly sealed. If
the drum seal is defective, air can bypass the heater box.
This creates a loss of negative pressure, reducing the
drying efficiency.
Clean Lint Trap
The lint trap must be kept clean. If the lint trap is clogged,
the negative pressure in the burner box is reduced and
the heat from the burner flows out the hole and is sensed
by the safety thermostat. The end result of a blocked lint
screen is that air will not be able to move freely, and the
drying time will increase.
For the system to work efficiently, these two elements must be maintained properly. Regular cleaning of the lint trap and
inspection of drum seals are essential maintenance tasks.

Drum Rotation and Clothing Exposure
Optimal Rotation Speed
The drum rotates at between 47 and 50 r/min (or rpm).
Engineering studies have shown that this is the optimum
range for drying the contents of the dryer. If the drum turns
any faster, the clothes would be pressed against the outside
of the drum and not tumble. If the drum turns more slowly,
the clothes ball up in the drum. In both of these cases, the
drying times are greatly increased.
Factors Affecting Drum Speed
The drum speed on the dryer is affected by the:
•Belt diameter
•Belt alignment
•Condition of the belt
Be sure to check and replace the belt if required.

Dryer Baffles Function
Clothing Movement
The baffles inside the dryer are positioned so that the clothing is tossed
around, increasing its exposure to the heated air.
Drying Efficiency
Without the baffles, the clothing would not dry as quickly.
Surface Exposure
Baffles ensure that all surfaces of the clothing items are exposed to the
heated air, preventing clumping and uneven drying.
Design Considerations
The number, size, and placement of baffles are carefully engineered to
provide optimal tumbling action for various load sizes and fabric types.

Dryer Service Approach
Problem Assessment
A gas technician/fitter is often faced with a dryer that has already been
installed but is not operating properly. It is then necessary to determine
the cause of the problem by troubleshooting the problem and running
tests on the dryer.
Wiring Diagram Interpretation
Properly testing the components of a dryer requires that you be
able to read and interpret wiring diagrams. This is covered in Unit 12
Basic electricity for gas fired equipment, Chapter 2. Interpret
electrical drawings.
Systematic Testing
Following a logical sequence of tests helps isolate the problem
area quickly and efficiently, leading to accurate diagnosis and
repair.

Electrical Sequence of Operation
1
Timer Activation
As soon as the timer is turned on, all the circuits close.
2
Door Switch Circuit
The circuit from the timer to the door switch is completed through
the door switch to the timer motor and drive motor.
3
Motor Circuits
The timer motor circuit is completed. The drive motor circuit is
completed. The centrifugal switch is closed.
4
Burner Activation
The circuit from the timer through the thermostat to the main coil
valve is closed. The neutral from the main coil valve is completed
through the limit switch and the centrifugal switch. The burner is
activated.
5
Lighting
The circuit from the timer to the panel and drum lights is closed (this
may differ from dryer to dryer).
Knowing the sequence of operation for the electrical start-up of the dryer will make it easier to determine possible faults. If this basic sequence of operation does
not occur, there is a problem with the dryer.

General Electrical Troubleshooting
Problem Isolation
Isolating the source of the problem is the
first step in fixing the problem.
Initial Testing
To locate the general problem area: Turn
on the dryer. Set the temperature to high.
Check the power at the burner. Test
switches and loads.
Power Verification
There are only two possible results when
checking power at the burner: If there is
power to the burner, concentrate your
tests on the burner. If there is no power to
the burner, check the operating switches
in the dryer circuit.

Burner Ignition Troubleshooting
System-Specific Approach
Due to the various ignition systems, troubleshooting the
burner ignition is dependent on the system used in the
dryer. The sequence of operation for each of these burner
ignition systems is discussed in the Burner ignition systems
section.
Glo-sil and Spark Ignition Testing
When line voltage is applied to the Glo-sil igniter, it should
heat up to its operating temperature in 10 to 30 seconds.
The resistance across the terminals of a good igniter should
be between 50 and 25 Ω in the Glo-sil coils.

Glo-sil Ignition Testing Procedure
Power Verification
If there is power to the burner, shut the power off.
Disconnect Leads
Disconnect the leads to the burner.
Multimeter Testing
Use a multimeter to check the sensor switch and Glo-sil.
Visual Inspection
Check for cracks in the Glo-sil.
Sensor Testing
If the Glo-sil is fine, check the radiant sensor for continuity.
Important! Never apply line voltage directly to the sensor.

Gas Smell Troubleshooting

Glow Coil Ignition Testing
Component Integration
The transformer, warp switch, and warp switch heater are all
combined into one unit. If any one of the three components fails,
they must all be replaced as a complete assembly.
Testing Procedure
To check the unit: Apply 120 V to the burner with the gas supply
turned off. The glow coil should glow for approximately 3.5 to 4
minutes and then go out as the warp switch opens.
Reset Period
Turn the dryer off, and after 10 to 15 minutes the warp switch
heater will cool sufficiently to allow the warp switch to again
close.

Barbecue Installation
Requirements
Consult Codes
Where relevant, consult CSA B149.1 and CSA B149.2 for
requirements on piping and tubing.
Follow Piping Requirements
The CSA B149 series of Codes sets requirements for the use of
piping and hoses, as well as for the marking of different types of
piping.
Check Local Regulations
Before installing any piping or tubing, consult the Code and
contact the local municipality to get any additional regulations.

Barbecue Conversion
Check Rating Plate
All gas appliances including
barbecues have an attached
rating plate that indicates
the type of gas that must be
used with the appliance.
First, check the rating plate
to see what type of gas the
barbecue is set up for.
Determine Need for
Conversion
If the appliance is set up for a
different type of gas than the
one being supplied, the
appliance must be
converted.
Follow Manufacturer
Guidelines
The Code states that the
manufacturer's guidelines
must be followed when
converting an appliance. If
there are no guidelines, the
appliance must be approved
after conversion.
Update Rating Plate
If a barbecue is converted
from one gas to another, the
rating plate must be
changed to indicate what
type of gas the barbecue has
been converted to.

Common Barbecue Conversions
Propane to Natural Gas
The most common type of conversion is to convert a propane barbecue for a natural gas supply. This
typically requires changing the orifices and adjusting the air shutters to accommodate the different
gas properties.
Natural Gas to Propane
The same criteria and conditions apply when converting a natural gas barbecue for propane supply.
For more information on appliance conversion, see Unit 9 Introduction to gas appliances, Chapter 6.
Requirements for converting an appliance between propane and natural gas.
If you have no previous conversion experience, it is a good idea to get an experienced person to assist
you.

Underground Copper Tubing Installation
Use Proper Connections
A common practice when installing
natural gas barbecues is to run
copper tubing underground. If this is
done, the tubing must be connected
by brazing or approved mechanical
compression fittings.
Rise Above Grade
Before the piping enters a building, it
must rise above grade.
Follow Code Requirements
All installations must comply with
local codes and regulations for
underground gas piping.
Test Connections
All connections must be tested for
leaks before covering the tubing.

Barbecue Hose Connection
Requirements
Location Restrictions
The hose may not go from one room into another, and it may not pass
through walls, partitions, ceiling, or floors.
Prohibited Connections
Slip-on-ends are not permitted.
Maintenance Requirements
The hose must be replaced the moment any damage or wear is noticed.
Length Limitation
The maximum length of the hose is 10 ft (3 m).

Shut-Off Valve Requirements
Valve Location
The shut-off valve for the barbecue
must be in the gas supply piping or
tubing and be installed immediately
upstream of the hose.
Handle Placement
The handle of a shut-off valve on an
independent connection must not
be closer than 6 inches (150 mm)
from the handle of any other shut-
off valve.
Safety Positioning
The shut-off valve must not be
placed at floor level or any other
location where it may be turned on
by accident.

Hose Placement Requirements
Visibility
The hose must be visible (it
must not be routed under a
deck)
Temperature
Protection
Prevented from contacting a
hot surface, and it must not
be subjected to
temperatures in excess of
125°F (50 °C)
Grease Protection
Protected from dripping
grease and other causes of
damage
Traffic Protection
Protected from passing
traffic and placed so that the
passage of traffic over the
hose is at a minimum

Quick Disconnect Fittings
Shut-Off Valve Requirement
Most gas barbecue systems use quick
disconnect fittings. If this is the case, a
readily accessible manual shut-off
valve must be installed upstream of the
quick disconnect device. A quick
disconnect device cannot be
substituted for a manual shut-off valve.

valve is closed.
Connecting the quick
disconnect hookup
Check that the fitting end on
the quick disconnect is clean
and free of debris.
Following proper safety procedures when connecting and disconnecting
quick disconnect fittings is essential to prevent gas leaks and ensure safe
operation of the barbecue.

Pressure Regulators for
Barbecues
Reduce Pressure
Pressure regulators are used to reduce the incoming gas
pressure
Maintain Consistency
Keep the pressure supplied to the barbecue at a constant
level
2-PSI Systems
If a house has a 2-pound per square inch (psi) gas system,
the barbecue supply will require an approved line pressure
regulator

Testing Barbecue
Connections
Inspect the Hose
Check the hose for any cuts, abrasions, and nicks.
Advise the User
Advise the user to do the same every time the barbecue is used.
Replace if Damaged
If the hose is damaged, replace it immediately.
Test for Leaks
All gas connections must be tested for leaks. A leak
detector or soap test can be used to do this.

Leak Testing Procedure
Burners Off
When testing for leaks, make sure all burners are in the off position
Gas Supply On
Ensure the gas supply is on
Check Key Positions
•Hose to manifold connection
•Valves to manifold connection
•Hose to quick disconnect connection
•Other connection points
After Testing
•Turn the gas supply off
•Rinse all the connections

Barbecue Gas Supply Types
Natural Gas Supply
If a barbecue is attached to a natural gas supply, the gas is piped to the barbecue
from a main supply line outside the building.
Propane Supply
If a barbecue uses propane, the gas is supplied from a main supply line to outside or a
cylinder.
The component parts of a propane cylinder are covered in Unit 11 Pressure regulators,
overpressure protection, meters, and fuel containers.

Barbecue Burner Types
Standard Burners
Some barbecues have only one burner while others have two burners placed side by
side. Some barbecues also come with side burners.
Infrared Burners
Many barbecues today incorporate infrared burner technology used as rotisserie
burners and, even in some cases, as the main burner. The infrared burner works by
focusing the flame of a standard gas burner onto a ceramic tile that has thousands of
microscopic holes in it.

Infrared Burner Benefits
Less Fuel Use
An infrared grill uses less
fuel because it cooks
faster and does not
require the same amount
of fuel as a gas barbecue
to reach cooking
temperatures.
Faster Cooking Time
Once lit, an infrared
burner will heat to over
1000°F (540 °C) in
approximately three
minutes.
Better Taste
The high, direct heat sears
meat quickly, locking in
juices for better flavor.
Simpler Cleaning
The high heat helps
vaporize drippings,
reducing flare-ups and
making cleanup easier.

Briquettes and Lava Rock
Heat Distribution
Many barbecues use ceramic briquettes or lava rocks. The gas flame heats
the surface of the briquettes or lava rocks that, in turn, radiate heat to cook
the food.
Proper Amount
Take care not to have too many lava rocks or briquettes since the heat
being trapped between the burner and the rocks may cause premature
burner burn-out and increase cooking times.

Barbecue Ignition Systems
Crossover or Piezo Ignition
The barbecue illustrated in Figure 3-5 uses a crossover or piezo ignition system. When the piezo
button is pushed, it energizes the igniter electrode inside the gas catcher ignition chamber. This
creates a spark that ignites the gas.
Manual Ignition
Barbecues can also be manually lit through a match-light hole in the front of the cooking box.
Caution! Always have the barbecue lid open before attempting ignition.

Barbecue Components
Overview
The expanded view of a Weber® barbecue shows the various
components that are common to most barbecues. Understanding these
components is essential for proper installation, maintenance, and
troubleshooting.

Key Barbecue Components
The main components of a barbecue include the lid, cooking grates, flavorizer bars, burner tubes, control panel, and igniter button. Each component
plays a crucial role in the operation and performance of the barbecue.

Barbecue Operation Safety
Seasonal Inspection
Each season, before the barbecue is used, a visual inspection must
be made to ensure that all piping and tubing are sound and that
there are no visible faults. Failure to do this could result in injury or
death.
Ignition Systems
There are two common ignition systems used in barbecues:
•Piezo, which is an electronic ignition system
•Manual ignition system

Piezo Ignition Procedure
Ensure Burners Are Off
To light a barbecue using the piezo igniter system, ensure first that all the burner control knobs are off.
Open Lid
Always open the lid before lighting the barbecue.
Turn On Gas Supply
Turn the gas supply valve on.
Turn First Burner Control
Turn the burner control that is closest to the igniter to START or HIGH.
Push Piezo Button
Push the piezo button several times so that it clicks each time. Each click creates a spark.
Check Ignition
Check through the match-light hole in the front of the cooking box to see if the front burner is lit.
Light Other Burners
If the burner is lit, turn on the other burners. They will light from the flame of the first burner.

Manual Ignition Procedure
Open Lid
Open the lid before lighting.
Turn On Gas
Turn the gas supply valve on.
Light Match
Light a match and put it through the match-light hole in the front of the cooking box.
Turn Burner Control
Turn the front burner control knob to START or HIGH.
Check Ignition
Check that the burner is lit by looking through the match-light hole.
Light Other Burners
Once the first burner is lit, turn on the other burners.

Extinguishing a Barbecue
Standard Shutdown Procedure
Barbecues using either of these ignition systems are
extinguished in the same way:
1.First, turn the gas supply valve off.
2.Then turn each burner control knob off.
If faced with an unfamiliar situation, check the
manufacturer's instructions.
Safety Precautions
Adhere to the following safety precautions:
•Always open the lid before lighting the barbecue.
•If the burner does not ignite, wait a few minutes for the
gas to clear before trying to ignite the burner again.
•Gas may collect in an area and explode when an attempt
is made to ignite the barbecue.
•Never lean over the barbecue or look through the match-
light hole when lighting the barbecue.

The Combustion Process in Barbecues
Gas Flow
When the burner control valve is
open, gas flows into the burner tube
through a venturi.
Pressure Reduction
The movement of the gas through
the venturi reduces pressure in the
burner tube.
2
Primary Air Intake
As a result, primary air is sucked into
the tube through air shutters.
Ignition
The primary air mixes with the gas in
the burner tube and is ignited at the
burner head.
Secondary Air
When the air-gas mixture ignites, it
draws in secondary air from around
the burner to complete the
combustion process.

Barbecue Flame Characteristics
Proper Flame Appearance
A good burner flame for a barbecue should have specific
characteristics that indicate proper combustion and
efficient operation.
Flame Color and Shape
The flame should be predominantly blue with slight yellow
tips. It should be steady and uniform across the burner. A
yellow or orange flame indicates incomplete combustion,
which may be caused by a blocked venturi or improper air-
to-gas ratio.

Adjusting Primary Air in Barbecue Burners
Air Shutter Adjustment
Each burner on the barbecue has an air shutter that can be adjusted to allow more
or less primary air into the burner tube. For some model of burners, the spider
guard will need to be removed before they can be adjusted, while other types will
have shutters that will move with the screen in place.
Spider Guards
Spider guards prevent spiders and other insects from nesting in burner tubes.
Without the guard and with nests in the burner tubes, gas may flow out of the air
shutter, causing a fire around the shutter. The burners do not have spider guards
after-market types are available that can be added over the venture tube air
shutters.

Spider Guard Maintenance
Signs of Blockage
A sign that the spider guard needs cleaning is a cooking flame that appears to be
yellow and lazy. This indicates that the air-gas mixture is not optimal, which can
affect cooking performance and efficiency.
Cleaning Procedure
Regular cleaning of the spider guard is essential to maintain proper burner function.
This typically involves removing the burner, cleaning the venturi tube with a pipe
cleaner or venturi brush, and ensuring that all openings are clear of debris and insect
nests.
After cleaning, reassemble the burner and check for proper flame characteristics to
ensure optimal performance.

PartConstruction
FrameUsually made of iron, aluminum,
brass, copper, or bronze. Brass
and copper are commonly used
on gas lamps because of their
resistance to rust.
BurnerWill either be copper or
ceramic. Is often enclosed by a
glass globe (The glass is
tempered to withstand
temperature changes.)

Gas Lamp Mantles
Purpose
Lamps are equipped with mantles, a device for generating
bright white light when heated by a flame.
Types of Mantles
There are two basic types of mantles:
•Soft mantles (soft auto-form mantles)
•Preformed hard mantles

Installing a Soft Mantle
Preparation
Ensure the lamp valve is
closed and the light has been
off long enough to cool
down. Remove the old
mantle.
Attachment
Loop the tie-on strings at
the throat of the mantle. Use
your fingers to enlarge the
throat so it will fit over the
burner. Fit the mantle over
the burner so that it seats in
the lower groove of the
burner nose.
Securing
Shape the mantle evenly.
Pull the ends of the tie-on
strings so that the mantle
and strings are seated
securely in the burner nose
groove. Tie a double knot in
the string and cut off the
ends.
Burning Off
Hold a lit match close to, but
not touching, the mantle.
The mantle should smoulder
as its protective coating
burns off. Once this is done,
the mantle becomes a form
of chemical ash and must be
handled carefully. It may
break if touched.

Completing Soft Mantle Installation
Cooling Period
Let the mantle cool for a few minutes after the coating has burnt off.
Ignition
Now turn the gas on, and light the mantle without touching it with the match. On a new installation, it may take a while
for the mantle to burn because of air in the gas line.
Adjustment
Turn the gas on fully to allow the mantle to burn to its proper shape. After about five minutes, adjust the gas control
for the desired amount of light.
Verification
When the gas light is burning properly, the flame is a bright white and has no visible outlines.

Installing a Preformed Hard
Mantle
Turn Off Gas
Ensure the gas supply is turned off and the light has been off long
enough to cool.
Remove Old Mantle
Carefully remove the old mantle from the burner.
Unpack New Mantle
Take the mantle out of its box, and place the throat over the burner
nose.
Complete Installation
Follow steps 6 to 12 from the procedure for soft mantles.

Gas Lamp Covers
Types
Gas lamp covers come in
different forms. They can be
similar to the type shown in
the image, or they can be more
like a globe that directly covers
the flame.
Purpose
Gas lamp covers serve a
decorative purpose as well as
protect the flame from
weather and other external
effects. They also safely
enclose the burning flame.
Material Requirements
The cover, including the glass, should be able to resist the sudden
temperature changes that occur when the lamp is switched on or
off.

Gas Lamp Operation
Manufacturer's
Instructions
Since there are many
different types of gas
lamps, it is important to
read the manufacturer's
instructions for specific
lamps.
User Documentation
These instructions should
be left with the user after
the lamp has been installed.
Operational Variations
Different models may have unique operating procedures and
maintenance requirements.

Types of Gas Lamps
Indoor Gas Lamps
Indoor gas lamps serve both practical and decorative
purposes. Make sure these lamps are used only in properly
vented rooms. Carbon monoxide is formed if there is
incomplete combustion. If the room is not properly vented,
there may be a buildup of dangerous gases.
The area around the lamp must also be kept free of
combustible materials, including flammable vapours and
liquids such as gasoline.
Outdoor Gas Lamps
Outdoor gas lamps are used mainly for decorative purposes.
They can usually operate in all types of weather and are
useful in the event of a power outage.
•With these lamps, there must be no obstruction to the
primary air flow.
•The lamp must be properly vented.
•There should be no combustible materials near the lamp.

Indoor Gas Lamp
Requirements
Primary Air Flow
Even though the gas flame is small, it still requires primary air for
combustion. The gas flows through a venturi to the burner. The
movement of gas through the venturi sucks in air through the air
ports.
No Obstructions
There should be no obstruction to the flow of primary air.
Clean Burner
If the burner is dirty or has insects nesting in it, the air flow will be
obstructed. The burner must be kept clean.

Gas Lamps With and Without Mantles
Selection Criteria
The selection of a lamp with or
without a mantle depends on the
intended use of the lamp.
Decorative Lamps
Gas lamps without mantles give a
"flicker flame" and are intended purely
for decorative purposes.
Functional Lighting
For functional lighting purposes, a
lamp equipped with a mantle is
required.

Gas Lamps with a Mantle
FlameDescription
Bright white and has no visible
outlines
Flame is burning properly.
Not bright white or has visible
outlines
The air flow to the gas may
need adjustment.
Yellow flameAir flow should be increased.
Poor flame qualityThe cause may be a broken
mantle, in which case the
mantle must be replaced.
In a mantle-equipped gas lamp, the mantle burns white hot and gives off
light.

Adjusting the Primary Air
Flow
Air-Shutter Rings
The primary air flow is
controlled by adjusting the
air-shutter rings near the
burner. (Check
manufacturer's instructions
to determine the exact
location.)
Optimal Light
Adjust the air-shutter rings
until the optimal light is
obtained.
Gas Pressure
The gas pressure may also need adjustment. Check the

Gas Lamp Ignition Methods
Electrode Ignition
An electrode that is operated manually with a switch or
automatically with a photosensor.
In automatic systems, a solar cell detects the light falling
below a certain point and opens an electronic circuit to the
electrode. It also opens the gas valve.
•The electrode will spark until the gas lamp is lit.
•A photosensor detects when the lamp is lit and stops the
electrode from sparking.
Manual Ignition
Manually using an open flame, such as a match.
This method requires the user to manually open the gas
valve and apply a flame to ignite the gas.
