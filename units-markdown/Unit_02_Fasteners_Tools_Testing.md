Typ e s of Powd e r- Actuated Tools
Lo w- Ve lo c it y ( Hilt i t yp e )
Ga s  t e c h n ic ia n s / fit t e r s  m o s t ly u s e  t h e  Hilt i b r a n d  o f lo w- ve lo c it y t o o l. It
operates on the captive piston principle. In this type, both the fastening pin
and the driving piston move at less than 100 m (325 ft) per second.
A b u ilt- in device prevents this type from firing if its flat end is held at more
than 7° off the work surface. The fastener must be close to vertical to the work
surface.
Me d iu m- Velocity (Ramset type)
When fired, the fastening pin travels at about 325 to 500 ft (100 to 150 m) per
second.
Hig h- Ve lo c it y To o ls
Hig h- velocity tools have limited application. They have no piston, and the pin
is discharged at a velocity above 500 ft (150 m) per second often up to 1500 ft
(450  m) per second.

Powder- Actuated Tool
Propulsion Methods
Im p a c t  P r o p u ls io n
In this method, a gap exists
between the fastener and the
piston. A stop ring absorbs
impact. For the tool to function
properly, you must replace the
stop ring when worn.
Contact Propulsion
In this method, the work
surface, fastener, and piston are
in direct contact.
Co- a c t in g  P r o p u ls io n
Only the piston and fastener are in contact. They are away from the
work surface .

Power Threaders
Ha n d- Held Power Threaders
These electrically powered machines are convenient for small jobs and are powerful enough (depending on the
model/ manufacturer) to thread pipe and/ or rod utilizing sizes from 1/ 8" up to 2". They are light- w e ig h t  in
comparison to general, full- sized powered threading machines. However, you should use them in conjunction with
an approved vice with support arm assembly.
Powered Threading Machines
These electrically powered machines are convenient for medium to large jobs and are typically powerful enough to
thread pipe and/or rod in any required size used for gas piping. There are many options for dies including ratchet
t yp e , m o n o  a s  w e ll a s  q u ic k- o p e n in g , s e lf- opening, and semi- a u t o m a t ic  u n ive r s a l d ie s .

Threading Die Heads
Various styles of quick- opening threaders are designed for use on power equipment such as a power threading machine. They attach to a carriage
assembly that also hosts a reamer and cutter. These types of die heads have a lever to release the dies from the pipe when the thread has been cut to
the required length, eliminating the need to stop and back off after the thread has been cut.

Cylinder Measurements
Cylinder Components
A cylinder has three key measurements:
•Diam e t e r (D) -  the width of the circular end
•Radius (R) -  half the diameter
•Le n g t h  ( L)  -  the distance from one end to the other
These measurements are essential for gas technicians when working with pipes and cylindrical
components.
The volume of a cylinder (such as pipe) is calculated using the formula:

Pocket Tapes
Most Common Measuring Device
The pocket- type or spring- loaded tape is the measuring device that gas technicians/fitters use most often. It is easy to carry, accurate, and long enough for most
purposes.
Me a s u re m e n t  C a p a b ilit ie s
Metric tapes have markings every millimeter. Imperial tapes have markings every 1/16 in or 1/32 in. You can use it for interna l and external measurements.
Ava ila b le  W id t h s
Available tape widths are 1/2 in, 3/4 in, and 1 in (12 mm, 19 mm, and 25 mm). Wide tapes are more rigid when extended. Narrow blades are easier to carry.

Fo ld in g  Ru le s
Typ e s  o f Fo ld in g  Ru le s
There are two basic types of folding rules:
•Hin g e d  r u le s
•S p r in g- jo in t e d  r u le s
Both may be made of plastic, metal or wood.
Me t r ic  r u le s  h a ve  m a r kin g s  e ve r y m illim e t e r . Im p e r ia l r u le s  h a ve
markings every 1/16 in or 1/32 in.
Folding rules fold to 6 in or 8 in (150  mm to 20 0  mm), so that you can
easily carry them. When extended, folding rules are rigid and can span
distances without sagging. This gives greater accuracy than a steel tape
on long spans.

combustion processes include the burning of gasoline in an automobile engine and the burning of natural gas as a fuel.

The Three Elements of Combustion
During combustion, oxygen from air combines with the combustible elements of a fuel- normally carbon and hydrogen-to release heat energy. However, fuel and oxygen
alone do not produce combustion. Raising the temperature to the ignition temperature at which combustion can take place also requires heat.
Removal of any one of the three elements stops combustion. For efficient combustion to take place, you must present each in the right quantity. It is important to have
the right flow of air containing oxygen. There can be too much or little air to support combustion.

What Are Flue Gases?
The combustion process forms
products which are usually
exhausted through a flue, vent, or
chimney. In the gas industry, these
are called flue gases. Altering the
a ir- gas mixture to the combustion
process affects the volume of and
percentage of flue gas components.
W h y An a lyz e  Flu e  Ga s ?
You must analyze flue gas to check
the efficiency of combustion and
the level of toxic gases.
What Is Measured?
A combustion analysis determines
the completeness of combustion
and what percentages of the total
volum e of dry flue gas are carbon
dioxide (CO2), oxygen (O2), and
carbon monoxide (CO). In certain
cases, you may also measure
h yd r o g e n  ( H2 ) , n it r ic  o x id e s  ( NO
and NOx), and hydrocarbons (HC).

follow the manufacturers' recommendations for storage, handling, calibration, and
use of these instruments.

Features and Benefits
The most commonly used flue gas analyzers are electronic, and
they come in many different makes and models. The field
technician/fitter usually uses a hand- held portable device, which
is  ve r s a t ile  a n d  n o t  d iffic u lt  t o  o p e r a t e .
The most up- to - date analyzers measure all the products of
combustion. Most analyzers have temperature probes and
pressure sensors built in.
Modern flue gas analyzers can store information, download the
data to a computer, and transmit the information to a printer to
produce hard copy reports for the client.
Mu lt i- g a s  e m is s io n  a n a lyz e r
With a continuous sampling device, sensors in the Unit
continuously analyzes a measured flow of flue gas sample for the
device's duration of being connected to the appliance, unlike its
predecessors which only manually spot sample at user-
determined intervals.

Tube Analyzers
Ho w Tu b e  An a lyze rs  W o rk
The least expensive flue gas analyzer uses pencil- shaped
glass tubes filled with dry chemicals. Each tube contains a
different chemical, and each one's function is to test for a
specific type of gas. Usually, the tubes are single- use.
Each detector tube contains precise amounts of detecting
reagents in a glass tube with a fixed inner diameter. The
tube is hermetically sealed at both ends to protect the
contents until they are exposed to the flue gas during
testing. Draeger and Gastec are two well- known
manufacturers of this type of equipment.
Gastec tube type flue gas analyzer system

Using Gastec Detector Tubes
Break Tube Ends
To start the test, break off
the tapered tube ends and
connect one opened end of
the tube to the Gastec
sampling pump.
Draw Sample
Pull the hand operated
vacuum pump handle to
draw the flue gas sample
through the tube. The pump,
which may draw a fixed
amount or be adjusted for
different tests, measures the
volume of gas drawn.
Observe Reaction

Lo n g e vit y
You can use the potassium
hydroxide for approximately 400

and the chromous chloride for
approximately 200 tests prior to

Pressure and Temperature Measurement
Pressure
When an object exerts a force over an area of another
object, it exerts pressure. Pressure is the force exerted
per Unit area.
Tem perature
Temperature (i.e., the degree of heat) is measured using
various scales such as Fahrenheit and Celsius. These
scales have fixed points used for comparison and are
based on such things as the boiling and freezing points
of wate r at a particular pre ssure .
Gas technicians/fitters use various gauges to measure gas pressure and temperature to ensure safe and efficient operation of gas
appliances.

What is a Manometer?
The manometer is a U- shaped tube that helps measure the difference in pressure
between the tops of the liquid in the two sides of the liquid is water or coloured gauge
oil. Small positive or negative pressures are expressed in inches of water column; 1 PSI
is equal to 27.7 inches of water column. Gas technicians/fitters most often use the
water column measurement.

Ohmmeters
De fin it io n
The ability of a substance to resist the flow of current is
called resistance and is measured in ohms (Ω)  o r  k ilo h m s
(kΩ).
You can use an ohmmeter to measure both resistance
and continuity of a circuit. (An open circuit represents an

O p e r a t io n
A flashlight type of battery powers the ohmmeter. This
drives current through the tested circuit's resistance.

attached. Although current is being measured, the scale
is  m a r k e d  in  o h m s .
It is important to set the zero for each measurement. This
action also tests the battery. It is also important to switch
off the ohmmeter when you finish measuring, so that the
battery is not drained.

Storage and Handling
Requirements
The gas technician/fitter uses many varied tools. Some are simple and
inexpensive, but others are complex, sensitive, and expensive. For the
most part, electrical test instruments fall into the second category.
If you roughly handle or improperly use these instruments, they could be
easily damaged. This will render them useless for accurate measurement,
which could be dangerous.

instruments—they have moving parts on jeweled bearings
and can get out of alignment if badly mistreated. Despite
this, they are designed for use in the field and have been
around for much longer than digital instruments.
