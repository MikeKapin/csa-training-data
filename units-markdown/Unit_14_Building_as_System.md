Building Envelope: Spray Foam Insulation
Spray Foam Characteristics
Spray foam insulation is mixed on site and sprayed onto
surface or into cavities. It expands and sets in seconds.
Between 1977 and 1980 urea formaldehyde (UFFI) was used
but application problems caused noxious odours. Currently
either polyurethane or semi-flexible isocyanurate plastic
foam are commonly sprayed on interior basement walls of
old houses.

Building Envelope: Insulation Installation Quality
Installation Assessment
Building Codes have specified the minimum amount of insulation required for residences
since 1965. However, the assessment conducted by the gas technician/fitter must be site-
specific, so the builder or owner should be questioned as to the actual insulation level and
method of installation.
This is of critical importance since the area of coverage, and the quality of the installation
must be considered.
Areas of Concern
The image shows areas of concern related to installation method. Although you will not be
removing the insulation, you should be investigating the method used with an eye to
completeness and quality.
Poor installation can create thermal bridges, air leakage paths, and areas where condensation
can form, all of which can affect gas appliance operation.

Building Envelope: Typical Heat Loss Distribution
Common Misconceptions
It is a common misconception that most of the heat escapes through the roof. The image shows typical
heat losses from a house based on information collected by the CMHC.
The early focus for insulation was on the attic, so the typical heat losses are less there than in the
neglected basement walls and floors.
Implications for Gas Technicians
Awareness of typical heat losses can help a gas technician/fitter in assessing the house and advising
the customer about increasing comfort levels by increasing insulation.
A disproportionate heat loss in one area of the house makes it difficult to balance heat delivery to all
parts of the house. The customer should be made aware of insulation problems that you find.

Building Envelope: Vapour Barrier Function
Purpose and Placement
A vapour barrier must be installed on the warm side of the insulation to
prevent warm moist air from passing into the insulated wall cavity and
condensing as the water vapour reaches the cold outside surfaces.
Without a vapour barrier, condensation occurs in the wall cavity. A vapour
barrier may be installed as much as one-third into the insulation but is
normally directly on the warm side of the insulation.
Materials and Installation
It is common practice to use 6 mil polyethylene plastic as both the air and
vapour barrier, although the two functions may be served by different
materials.
The vapour barrier must be impervious to moisture in any of its forms, but it
does not have to be as tightly sealed or as rigid as the air barrier.

Building Envelope: Wall Coverings and Openings
Wall Coverings
Wall coverings can add insulation value and serve as an air
and/or vapour barrier. In older homes, the oil base paint,
varnish, or vinyl wallpaper can act as an adequate vapour
barrier.
Drywall with gaskets or plaster will also serve as a vapour
and air barrier. Special attention should be given to ensure
that high moisture areas, such as kitchens, bathrooms, and
earthen basements are covered by a vapour barrier.
Windows, Doors, and Vents
Windows, doors, and vents are necessary breaks in the
building envelope that unfortunately allow less control over
air, heat, and moisture flow. An assessment of these
openings is important to identify problem areas for your
appliances.
Air tightness and thermal resistance are the key factors to
assess. Any signs of condensation, frost, or drafts indicate a
problem with the window and/or the humidity control in the
house.

Building Envelope: Window Energy Ratings
Energy Rating (ER) System
Windows can have an insulating value measured on the RSI
and R scales or newer windows are rated using the Energy
Rating (ER) value. The ER value is based on a calculation of
the window's ability to:
•Admit solar heat
•Prevent heat loss by conduction
•Resist air leakage losses
The ER is measured in watts per m² and given a value from –
50 to +15, with 0 being a neutral point of heat gains
balancing losses.
Window Performance Factors
The ER value of a window is determined by the number of
panes, the thickness of the air space between the panes, and
the coatings or gases employed.
A low emissivity (Low-E) coating allows sunlight to pass
through but inhibits heat from radiating out. The image
shows the components of a high-performance window.

Heat Loss Through Doors
Doors are also part of the building envelope and come in a variety of
insulating materials and sealing mechanisms that have to be considered
by the heating technician.
Generally of higher insulating value than windows, doors are more
commonly the source of air leakage, so the joint sealing method is of
critical importance.

Building Envelope: Caulking and Weather Stripping
Importance for Air Sealing
Caulking and weather stripping are the final components of the building envelope. The volume of air movement through
the envelope can be greatly reduced by sealing cracks and joints.
A variety of materials are available that do not require the expertise, intensive labour, and costs that other improvements
demand.
Customer Education
During your assessment of the building envelope, it is worthwhile pointing out the areas to the customer where caulking
and weather stripping can significantly improve comfort and fuel efficiency.
Remember that air movement can increase discomfort and transfer water vapour into the building envelope. The
heating system cannot correct these comfort and humidity problems unless the indoors is sealed from the outdoors.

Mechanical/Electrical Equipment: Overview
Role in Building System
Behind the protection of the building envelope, the
mechanical and electrical equipment plays a primary role in
creating the indoor environment.
The heating and ventilation systems are the gas
technician's/fitter's key interest, but other equipment in the
house—lighting, kitchen appliances, washers, dryers, etc.—
cannot be ignored since they also affect the flow of air, heat,
and moisture.
Equipment Categories
Although the heating and ventilation systems may share
components, as is the case with forced-air heating systems,
they will be addressed separately. The focus is on how each
equipment group affects the flow of air, heat, and moisture
and how the groups interact with the rest of the building as a
system. The groups are:
•Heating equipment
•Ventilation equipment
•Other mechanical and electrical equipment

Mechanical/Electrical Equipment: Heating System Sizing
Importance of Proper Sizing
The heat lost by the building must be replaced by the space heating system at
a rate and in a manner that provides consistent comfort to the occupants.
IfThen
An undersized heating system is
installed
The heat loss on the coldest days
will be greater than the heating
equipment can supply and the
desired indoor temperature
cannot be attained.
An oversized heating system is
installed
Its rate of heat production causes
it to short cycle since it will satisfy
the thermostat before it reaches
steady-state efficiency. As a
result, fuel costs will be excessive.
Common Sizing Methods
Common but inadequate methods for determining heating system size
include:
•Guess
•Use a "rule of thumb" method based on square footage
•Use a "rule of thumb" method based on types of houses (two-storey,
ranch, bungalow, etc.)
•Replace with the same size of furnace removed
•Let the customer decide
What is needed is a tried and true method that takes into account as many of
the site-specific heat loss variables as possible. Various methods do exist and
are collectively known as heat loss calculation methods.

Mechanical/Electrical Equipment: Consequences
of Improper Sizing
Comfort Issues
Improperly sized space heating equipment can cause
heating discomfort to customers. Undersized systems can't
maintain temperature on cold days, while oversized
systems create temperature swings.
Structural Damage
Damage to the structure can occur, such as frozen pipes if
undersized and condensation in the chimney if oversized.
This condensation can lead to chimney deterioration and
potential safety hazards.
Equipment Damage
Damage to the appliance can result from long cycles
(undersized) or short cycles (oversized). Short cycling
particularly causes excessive wear on components and
reduces equipment lifespan.
Energy Waste
Inefficient and costly energy use occurs with improperly
sized systems. Undersized systems may cause excessive
electricity use from supplemental heating, while oversized
systems waste fuel through inefficient operation.

Mechanical/Electrical Equipment: Heat Distribution Systems
Types of Heating Systems
Heat distribution depends partly on the type of heating system (forced air, radiant
baseboard, radiant floor, etc.) and partly on installation issues common to all types of
heating systems.
The image compares forced-air systems to radiant heating systems to illustrate the
effects that the type of heating system can have on the flow of air, heat, and moisture
as well as on other comfort issues in the house.
Temperature Stratification
Different heating systems create different temperature patterns in a room:
•Forced air systems tend to create stratification with cold floors and warm ceilings
•Radiant systems (especially in-floor) create more even temperature distribution
with warmer floors

Mechanical/Electrical Equipment: Heating System Comparison
Comfort issueForced-air systemRadiant system
Air flowSignificant volume of air mechanically redistributed
throughout the house either intermittently during
heating cycle or continuously at varying speeds.

and levels requiring careful balancing.
Relatively minor redistribution of air within or
between rooms. Constant air flow patterns created
by convection of air contacting radiant surface.
Minimal potential for pressure differences.
Heat flowPrimary method of heat flow is air temperature,
thus emphasizing heat transfer by convection over
conduction and radiation. Heat distribution within a

Moisture flowRelative humidity during winter is decreased,
resulting in drier air due to higher air temperature.
Significant ability to improve winter humidity levels
by means of add-on humidifier.
Relative humidity is less affected due to lower air
temperature. Minor ability to improve winter
humidity levels by means of add-on humidifier to
radiant surface.

Mechanical/Electrical Equipment: Heat Distribution Issues
Balanced Delivery
As previously discussed in relation to input size, the heat gain must balance the
heat loss. This applies to delivery on a room by room basis - the heat loss from a
particular room must be balanced by an equivalent heat gain from the heating
system.
The size and design of ducts or piping and the flow rate of the heated medium to
each room are the key factors in delivering the calculated heat gain.
Focused Delivery
Control over the flow of air, heat, and moisture requires that the distribution
system delivers heat (whether space heat or domestic water heat) only to the end
use location.
Uncontrolled losses and condensation caused by jacket heat loss or distribution
heat losses must be minimized. The greatest losses occur in unheated spaces;
insulation is required to focus heat delivery and prevent condensation.

Mechanical/Electrical Equipment: Air Consumption
Combustion Air Requirements
Air consumption by any heating appliance in the building must be closely considered using the building as a system approach. Simple
replacement of the air consumed and exhausted for combustion is not enough, since air pressures and air quality must also be
considered for safe operation of the appliances.
Backdrafting Concerns
Pressure-induced backdrafting is the main concern. Any condition that can create or contribute to a negative building pressure can
cause backdrafting and spillage of flue gases.
These conditions include the five effects discussed in relation to the building envelope: stack effect, wind effect, mechanical systems
effect, flue effect, and the combined effect.

Mechanical/Electrical Equipment: Negative Pressure Issues
Causes of Negative Pressure
Negative building or room pressure is caused by insufficient supply of makeup and combustion air. The image shows
how negative pressure is created by supplying less air than is removed.
The competition for air in a tightly air-sealed house is easily lost by natural draft vented appliances and even mechanical
draft appliances that use indoor air.
Competing Exhaust Devices
The mechanical exhaust fans contained in range hoods and clothes dryers can continue to operate under severe
negative pressures of -60 to -125 Pa (-0.25 inch to -0.5 inch w.c.).
A roaring wood fire creates a thermal draft that far exceeds the usual −5 Pa (−0.02 inch w.c.) pressures created by
natural draft vented appliances or the 10–15 Pa (0.04–0.06 inch w.c.) pressures created by mechanical draft vented
appliances.

Mechanical/Electrical Equipment: Ventilation Systems
Purpose of Ventilation
Ventilation is the process of supplying or removing air from a space.
Until recently, it was assumed that natural ventilation through leaks,
cracks, and openings in the building envelope was sufficient for the
control of indoor air quality (IAQ) and humidity.
Tighter building envelopes and awareness of IAQ problems have led
to the increased use of mechanical ventilation equipment.
Ventilation System Categories
Mechanical ventilation systems can be categorized and assessed by
how they perform two important functions:
1.Control building pressure
2.Distribute air through the building
For each function, there are three basic types:
Pressure control typesDistribution types
Exhaust-onlyDirect-ducted
Supply-onlyRecirculating
BalancedThrough-the-wall

Mechanical/Electrical Equipment: Exhaust-Only Ventilation
System Operation
The exhaust-only system is probably the most common mechanical ventilation system used. A
negative or suction pressure is created by exhaust fan(s) and fresh air enters the building by
infiltration due to the negative pressure.
This system is dependent on the building having sufficient air leakage in the envelope. A
dedicated exhaust fan may be installed for the sole purpose of removing air at a predetermined
rate to bring about a certain air change.

and moisture

Mechanical/Electrical Equipment: Supply-Only Ventilation
System Operation
A supply-only system creates a positive pressure in the building envelope
and, like the exhaust-only system, depends on sufficient air leakage for
proper operation.
This type of mechanical ventilation system commonly uses the circulating
fan and distribution system of the forced-air furnace or the cooling system
ductwork if radiant heating is used.

Mechanical/Electrical Equipment: Balanced Ventilation
System Operation
A balanced system is a term given to a mechanical ventilation system that
supplies and exhausts air mechanically. The use of the word "balanced" may be
misleading. These systems can be designed to create a significant positive or
negative pressure, or, ideally, a neutral pressure in the building.
Preheating of the supply air with the exhaust air using a heat recovery ventilator
(HRV) is the most common installation method. An HRV is required by the Ontario
Building Code for any new house with a fireplace, electric heat, or a natural draft
appliance installed.

Mechanical/Electrical Equipment: Heat Recovery Ventilators
HRV Components and Operation
An HRV consists of two fans—one to bring in air, the other to exhaust air—creating a balanced air flow. The heat exchanger is a static
device that recovers the temperature difference between the two air streams.
Energy recovery ventilators (ERVs) are a type of HRV that give more control of moisture in the building. During warm and humid
weather, incoming outside air transfers its moisture to the outgoing exhaust; whereas in the winter, it will recover some of the moisture
that would be exhausted to the outdoors by a regular HRV.
HRV System Diagram
The diagram shows a balanced system using an HRV. The heat exchanger core allows heat transfer between exhaust and supply air
streams without mixing the air itself, providing energy efficiency while maintaining indoor air quality.

Mechanical/Electrical Equipment: Distribution Systems
Types of Distribution Systems
The type of distribution employed influences the overall effect of the mechanical ventilation system on the other components of the
building system. There are three types of distribution systems:
•Direct-ducted (dedicated)
•Recirculating
•Through-the-wall
Direct-Ducted Systems
Direct-ducted (or dedicated) distribution systems use an independent duct system to transfer air between the outdoors and each
room or zone of the house.
Although direct ducting is possible with any of the pressure control types, it is seldom employed with a supply-only system since the
preheating problems of the cold outside air are significant. It is commonly used with radiant heating systems by employing small
diameter, flexible ducts that may also serve the cooling system during summer.

Mechanical/Electrical Equipment: Duct Balancing
Importance of Balancing
Direct-ducted systems provide the greatest control over the flows of air, heat, and
moisture that is possible for each of the pressure control types.
Balancing of each duct is required for best results. This ensures that the right amount
of air is delivered to or removed from each space according to its requirements.
Recirculating Distribution Systems
Recirculating (or combination) distribution systems have as their primary purpose
the recirculation of air between parts of the house. These systems also employ
ductwork to deliver and remove air from each room or area and may have a
connection to outside air for exhaust or supply.
However, the percentage of outside air supply moved through the ductwork is minor
compared to the volumes recirculated within the house.

Mechanical/Electrical Equipment: Through-the-Wall Systems
System Operation
Through-the-wall distribution systems are only used with exhaust-only mechanical ventilation systems. These systems consist
of air intake openings positioned high on exterior walls to allow a more controlled outside air supply compared to accidental
infiltration.
The negative pressure created by the exhaust fan(s) causes air to enter through the designed inlet diffusers. Less air is drawn
through cracks in the building envelope and the negative pressure in the house is reduced.
Design Considerations
The high inlets move the warm air away from the ceilings and allow some preheating before reaching the occupants. A separate
circulation system is necessary for even distribution of fresh air.
These systems are never used in houses taller than two storeys, because the upper inlets would be overwhelmed by the stack
effect, thus increasing negative building pressure.

Mechanical/Electrical Equipment: Other Household Devices
DeviceDescription
Ranges and ovensThese cooking devices contribute not only heat and odours to the house but also
dangerous gases in the case of gas units.
Clothes dryersThe exhaust capacity of most clothes dryers exceeds 85 L/s (180 cfm). For a 1200
ft² bungalow, the clothes drier alone would effect a 0.6 air change per hour. The
clothes dryer vent must terminate outdoors. The practice of drying clothes indoors
or venting the drier indoors can add 10 L of moisture per week to a house with a
family of four. Venting gas-fired dryers outdoors is critical for preventing
recirculation of combustion gases within the house.
Washing machinesWhether washing clothes or dishes, these machines can add as much as 4 L of
moisture per week to a house with a family of four. Added ventilation to the area
may be required.
RefrigeratorsThe heat and moisture effects of a refrigerator add another variable. Some older
units may add 3 or 4 times as much moisture to the building as newer, better-
insulated models.

Mechanical/Electrical Equipment: More Household Devices
DeviceDescription
Humidifiers and dehumidifiersThe presence or absence of these devices will affect the level of control over the
flow of moisture in a house. Proper installation and maintenance are essential.
Air cleanersIf or where these devices are installed and how they are maintained will have a
great effect on air, heat, and moisture flow. Filters on recirculating kitchen fans
or supply intake fans are as important to consider as the one on the forced-air
furnace.
Central vacuum cleanersIf these devices are vented outdoors, they can cause significant building
depressurization during operation.
Lighting and electrical appliancesThe heat produced from all electrical devices, especially incandescent lighting,
has a significant effect on comfort levels. Exceptional usage should be factored
into any assessment of the building system.

Occupants: Impact on Building Systems
Occupant Variability
The effect of the occupants on the other components of the building
system and on the flow of air, heat, and moisture is the most variable and
difficult to predict. It is that variability and unpredictability that the building
envelope and mechanical/electrical equipment have to respond to in
maintaining a comfortable indoor environment.
Occupant Categories
Although the greatest variance in conditions comes from the activities of
the human occupants, other items in this occupant category must also be
considered. These include:
•Animals
•Plants
•Furnishings, carpets, and fabrics
•Food, cleaning products, chemicals (cosmetics, hobby supplies)
•Firewood or other moisture-laden material stored indoors

Occupants: Assessment Considerations
IssueDescription
The number and age of the human occupantsThe range of flow effects created by an elderly couple will be significantly
different from that created by a young family of four. An elderly couple
usually wants the room temperature and humidity higher, opens doors
less, and has fewer activities that have a negative impact on indoor air
quality. The flow of air, heat, and moisture will be more difficult to control
with more and younger occupants.
Activities of the human occupantsActivities that require extensive use of exhaust systems can have a
significant effect on the building and appliance operation. These
activities may include hobbies such as woodworking and commercial or
home-based businesses such as cooking. The gas technician/fitter
should note and consider unusual activities that could potentially affect
the flow of heat, air, or moisture and/or affect air quality.
Unusual number or special characteristics of plants and animalsA building with a large number of plants or animals will alter the building
as a system. An increased moisture level is the main concern, but air
quality and air consumption issues may also pose problems for gas
appliances.

Occupants: More Assessment Considerations
IssueDescription
Type and condition of the furnishingsA home full of antique wood furniture will require more attention to heat
distribution and humidity levels compared to a home with metal or plastic
furniture. The position of the furniture in relation to the heating and
ventilation distribution registers should also be observed, as blocked
registers can adversely affect the operation of a gas appliance.
Type and location of the floor coveringsThe occupant's choice of tile or carpet over a radiant floor heating system
can affect the performance of the appliance. Area rugs or carpets that block
forced air registers can adversely affect the operation of a gas appliance.
Odours and use of chemicalsWarning signs of inadequate ventilation or improper use or storage of
chemicals are quickly detected by the technician's/fitter's nose when
entering the building. Consideration should be given to how these odours
indicate problems that may affect the building as a system as well as any gas
appliances.
Unusual water usesMaintaining large open aquariums and drying clothes indoors are just two
activities that can adversely increase moisture levels in a building.

Occupants: Advice on Air Flow
Recommendations for Occupants
In most cases, the resolution to problems created by the occupants is education. The gas
technician/fitter should be able to explain why the effects require correction and give advice on
how the problems can be resolved by the occupants.
The following recommendations can help occupants improve air flow in their homes:
•Provide wind breaks on the windward side of the house
•Air seal the house, especially the upper floors and ceiling
•Install, use, or maintain a mechanical ventilation system
•Open a window when using a wood fireplace
•Keep air supply inlets clear to an appliance or appliance room
Air Supply Inlet Maintenance
The outside termination of the air supply inlet to the appliance or to an appliance room must
remain unobstructed by plants or snow.
For appliances that use indoor air supplied from the outdoors by a vent or duct, the inside
termination must also remain unobstructed. If you find that it is intentionally blocked and the
customer complains about the continuous cold air draft proceeding from the opening, this may
indicate that there is a negative building pressure or prevailing wind problem.

Occupants: Advice on Heat Flow
Heat Flow Recommendations
The following are examples of advice that can be given to the occupants regarding their
effect on heat flow:
•Provide the building with better exposure to sunlight
•Install insulation or better windows in the building envelope
•Replace an exhaust-only or supply-only ventilation system with a heat recovery
ventilator
•Do not obstruct return or supply air registers with furniture/carpets
•Open drapes/curtains during the day and close them at night
Window Management
The image shows how occupants can positively affect heat loss/gain by use of drapes.
Opening curtains during the day allows solar heat gain, while closing them at night reduces
heat loss through windows.
This simple practice can significantly improve comfort and reduce heating costs, especially
in homes with older, less efficient windows.

Occupants: Advice on Moisture Flow
Exterior Water
Management
Direct eavestrough flow away
from house and grade lawn away
from foundation to prevent
water infiltration
Building Maintenance
Repair water leaks in building
envelope, especially basements,
to prevent moisture damage
Ventilation Use
Install and operate exhaust fans
in bathrooms and kitchen to
remove moisture at the source
Indoor Moisture Sources
Cover aquariums and do not dry clothes indoors to
reduce indoor humidity levels
Dryer Venting
Never vent a clothes dryer into the building - this is
especially dangerous for gas-fired dryers as
combustion gases with potentially poisonous gases
are also emitted

Occupants: Advice on Air Quality
Vehicle Exhaust Management
Reduce exposure to vehicle exhaust by not running
vehicle in the garage. Install tight-fitting, self-closing
door to attached garage to prevent exhaust gases from
entering living spaces.
Pollutant Control
Eliminate, separate, ventilate, or filtrate any pollutants.
This may include proper storage of chemicals, adequate
ventilation during activities that produce pollutants, and
use of air filtration systems.
Safe Storage
Remove contaminants to a safe outdoor storage location.
Many household chemicals, paints, and solvents release
volatile organic compounds that can affect indoor air
quality and potentially interfere with proper combustion
in gas appliances.
Regular Maintenance
Ensure regular maintenance of all combustion appliances
and ventilation systems to maintain proper operation and
prevent air quality issues from developing.

Building as a System: Integrated Approach
Outside Environment
Climate, terrain, and outdoor air
quality affect the building's
performance
Building Envelope
Controls the flow of air, heat, and
moisture between inside and outside
Mechanical Systems
Heating, ventilation, and other
equipment maintain comfort and air
quality
Occupants
Activities and choices significantly
impact building performance
The building-as-a-system approach is based on the principle that every change that occurs in and around the building has the
potential for improving and/or deteriorating the system. As such, the wide range of changes by the occupants—human and
other—must be considered for their effects on the entire building system, especially gas-fired appliances.

Gas Technician's Role in Building System Assessment
Comprehensive Assessment
Evaluate all four subsystems (outside environment, building envelope, mechanical/electrical systems, and occupants) to understand their interactions
Problem Identification
Recognize how issues in one subsystem can affect gas appliance operation and safety
Appropriate Solutions
Implement solutions that address the root cause rather than just symptoms
Customer Education
Provide guidance to occupants on how their actions affect building performance and appliance operation

Summary: Building as a System
Key Principles
Understanding the building as a system requires recognizing
that all components interact with each other. The flow of air,
heat, and moisture through a building is affected by:
•The outside environment (climate, terrain, outdoor air
quality)
•The building envelope (construction type, insulation,
air/vapor barriers)
•Mechanical/electrical systems (heating, ventilation,
appliances)
•Occupants (activities, choices, lifestyle)
Gas Technician's Perspective
For gas technicians/fitters, this systems approach is
essential for:
•Proper appliance selection and sizing
•Safe installation practices
•Effective troubleshooting
•Ensuring customer comfort and safety
•Preventing problems before they occur
By understanding how each subsystem affects the flow of
air, heat, and moisture, gas technicians can anticipate
problems and provide solutions that address the root causes
rather than just symptoms.

Heat Loss Calculation Methods
The primary function of a space-heating appliance is to replace the heat lost by the
building at a rate and in a manner that provides consistent comfort to the occupants. An
improperly sized heating system will create significant problems.
Heating Discomfort
Occupants may experience inconsistent or inadequate heating.
Structural Damage
Frozen pipes if undersized and condensation in the chimney if oversized.
Appliance Damage
Damage resulting from long cycles or short cycles.
Energy Inefficiency
Excessive electricity use if undersized and excessive fuel use if oversized.

Basic Principles of Heat Loss Calculation
Room-by-Room Calculation
Although the overall calculation for the heat loss of the
building is necessary to determine the size of the furnace or
boiler, a calculation of heat loss on a room-by-room basis is
required to size the distribution system.
Most methods use a room-by-room calculation and add the
individual room requirements to determine the total heat
loss.
Sizing Guidelines
The output of the heating appliance must never be less than
the total calculated heat loss nor exceed it by more than
40%.
This ensures the system is neither undersized (causing
discomfort) nor grossly oversized (causing inefficiency and
potential damage).

HRAI is probably the most detailed and commonly used method in Canada. Some
municipalities require submission of a heat loss calculation conducted using a
recognized method before permitting construction or renovation of a residence.

Heat Loss Calculation Example
Heat loss calculations are based on maintaining a design indoor temperature (18, 20, or 22 °C) against a design outdoor temperature.
The design outdoor temperature is based on data from the local weather department or a list provided with the heat loss training
manual.
Average temperatures in Ottawa
Outdoor design temperature°CMean soil design
temperature
°C
-25-131050

Design Temperature Difference
Definition
The difference between the selected indoor design
temperature and the outdoor design temperature is the
design temperature difference.
This will be used in calculating heat losses through all
above-grade walls and ceilings directly exposed to the
outdoor temperature.
Calculation Example
For a house in Ottawa that desires an indoor temperature of
22 °C:
Heat loss ΔT = Indoor design temp. - Outdoor design temp.
Heat loss ΔT = 22 °C - (-25 °C) = 47 °C

Heating System Sizing
Considerations
Thermal Resistance
Thermal resistance of walls, ceilings, floors, windows, and doors directly
exposed to outdoor temperatures
Air Change
Air change caused by uncontrolled air leakage through cracks and
openings in the building
Distribution Heat Loss
Duct or pipe heat loss from the distribution system passing through
unheated spaces
Ventilation Heat Loss
Heat loss from mechanical ventilation systems

Calculating Thermal Resistance
Wall Construction Example
The thermal resistance of walls, ceilings, floors, and headers
is calculated using reference data on wall types and building
envelope materials.
The RSI value is the sum of the resistance of each layer of
material in the wall, floor, etc.
Wall materialThermal resistance (RSI)

2 cm air space0.18
2 cm plywood0.18
10 cm fibreglass2.11
2 cm gypsum board0.09
Total thermal resistance

## 2.64 


Calculating Conductive Heat Loss
Calculation Method
A thermal resistance for each type of wall, ceiling, or floor
construction is determined and then converted to a heat
loss multiplier by dividing the design temperature difference
by the total thermal resistance.
This factor can be multiplied by the wall area in m² or ft² to
determine the conductive heat loss in Btu/h or kW/h for that
particular section.
Example Calculation
For a 2 m high × 3 m long wall with a 1 m square window in
Ottawa:
Wall heat loss = HL ΔT × (Wall area – Window area) ÷ RSI
Wall heat loss = 47 °C × 5 m² ÷ 2.64 RSI = 89 Watts (304
Btu/h)
Note: Watts can be converted to Btu/h by formula: 1 W =

## 3.412 Btu/h


Window Heat Loss Calculation
Window Heat Loss
The heat loss from windows is calculated using the same
method with reference to information tables on the thermal
resistance of common window types.
Example Calculation
For a 1 m square double-glazed window with Low-E having
an RSI value of 0.49:
Window heat loss = HL ΔT × Window area ÷ RSI
Window heat loss = 47 °C × 1 m² ÷ 0.49 RSI = 96 Watts (328
Btu/h)
Therefore, the total heat loss from the room with one
exposed wall and a window is 185 Watts (632 Btu/h).

Calculating Air Leakage
Air Leakage Factors
Air leakage heat loss is determined by reference to:
•Building types (very loose, loose, average, tight, very
tight)
•Exposure to wind categories (sheltered, partially
sheltered, exposed, extremely exposed)
•Number of storeys (1 to 3)
Example
A house in Ottawa might have an air leakage heat loss factor
of 0.3 W/m²-°C (0.053 Btu/ft²-°F) because it falls into these
categories:
•"Very tight" - new building with a continuous air barrier
with sealed joints
•"Partially sheltered" - rural area with low buildings, trees,
etc.
•2-1/2 storeys
This may add another 30% to the heat load for the room.

Distribution and Ventilation Heat Loss
Distribution Heat Loss
Distribution heat losses are factored in by multiplying the
room net heat load by a multiplier that considers:
•Type of unheated space the duct or pipes pass through
•How much they are insulated
Reference to simple tables is required for these calculations.
Ventilation Heat Loss
Mechanical ventilation heat loss is calculated by multiplying
the total ventilation capacity (TVC) with a constant factor
and the HL ΔT.
For new homes built to meet the current National Building
Code of Canada (NBC), the TVC is the room ventilation
required by the NBC.
The furnace/boiler must be sized to heat this outdoor air
infiltration to the design indoor temperature.

Heat Loss Calculation
Worksheets
Heat loss worksheets are commonly employed to organize calculations.
The total heat losses from conduction through walls, windows, etc.,
accidental air leakage, distribution system, and ventilation are added
together to arrive at the total heat loss per room.
The heat loss calculation is much simpler than it may first appear. There
are computer programs that simplify the process by filling in basic
information gathered from blueprints or simple measurements taken at
the site.

Importance of Heat Loss
Calculations
Understanding Principles
Not every gas technician/fitter has
to be able to complete the
calculations, but every gas
technician/fitter must understand
the principles underlying the
calculations and why the calculation
is absolutely necessary.
System Assessment
It is necessary not only for new
installations or replacements but
also for an assessment of the
performance of an existing system.
Identifying Weaknesses
The process of calculating heat losses exposes the strengths and weaknesses of
the building system. In some cases, the problems in the system would be better
corrected by caulking or insulation than by increasing the size of the heating
appliance.

Depressurization Tests
One of the most important uses of the building-as-a-system approach is
to ensure safe combustion and effective venting for fuel-fired
appliances. The approach highlights the interrelation between venting
and air flow caused by all components of the building system.
Depressurization can occur when the air pressure inside a house is lower
than it is outside. It is more frequent in existing houses after they have
been retrofitted and airsealed.

ACT Procedure Overview
Purpose
The CMHC ACT procedure is designed to assist
technicians/fitters in determining when and how to
investigate pressure-induced backdrafting using the
building-as-a-system approach.
ACT stands for Assessment, Check, Test.
When to Use
This procedure can be used on:
•New installations
•Service calls where a spillage-susceptible gas-fired
appliance is installed
•Whenever flue gas spillage is suspected by the
occupants or the gas technician/fitter

Spillage-Susceptible Appliances
Natural-Draft Appliances
Especially susceptible to flue gas
spillage due to negative building
pressure
Fan-Assist Appliances
Not as spillage susceptible, but may
still spill if negative pressure is severe
Positive-Pressure Vented
Appliances
Less susceptible, but any appliance
using indoor air for combustion may
spill flue gases
Direct Vent Appliances
May leak flue gases if the heat
exchanger is cracked or the vent is
damaged

Natural Draft Water Heater
This image shows a spillage-susceptible natural draft water heater.
These appliances are particularly vulnerable to backdrafting when
negative pressure conditions exist in the building.

Fan Assist Water Heater
This image shows a less spillage-susceptible fan assist water heater. The
fan helps overcome some negative pressure, but these units can still
experience spillage under severe conditions.

Positive-Pressure Vented
Furnace
This image shows a less spillage-susceptible positive-pressure vented
furnace using indoor air for combustion. These units are designed to
overcome some negative pressure, but can still be affected by severe
depressurization.

Direct Vent Fireplace
This image shows a non-spillage-susceptible direct vent fireplace. These
units are designed to bring in combustion air from outside and vent
directly to the exterior, making them highly resistant to indoor pressure
conditions.

ACT Procedure: Assessment Phase
The assessment phase requires no physical tools but does require a sound understanding of the building as a system. The gas
technician/fitter asks the customer a few leading questions, listens carefully to the answers, and conducts a quick visual
assessment to determine if the house is tight or loose.
As you approach the house, take note of the environmental conditions, orientation and protection of the house regarding wind
and sun, the exterior condition of the envelope (especially exterior vents/chimneys), and any condensation on the window or
eaves.

ACT Procedure: Check Phase
The check portion of the ACT procedure is even easier and quicker to complete. You may already have conducted the outside inspection, shown in the
following checklist, on your approach to the house.
QuestionsYesNo
Does a visual inspection of the chimney or vent exterior indicate:
· Damage to bricks, mortar, joints or cap?
· Efflorescence or moisture?
· Corrosion of exposed metal vent especially
the base tee?

Chimney and Vent Inspection
QuestionsYesNo
Does an inspection (directly and with a mirror) of the chimney or vent clean
out indicate:
· Blockage or
obstruction?
· Pieces of bricks, clay
tile or metal dust?
· Moisture or white
sediment?
· Excessive soot
buildup?

Vent Connector and Heat
Exchanger Inspection
QuestionsYesNo
Does an inspection of the vent connector indicate:
· Moisture or soot stains
at the joints?
· Corrosion?
· Excessive soot
buildup?
Are there any symptoms of a cracked heat exchanger such as:
· Occupants report
odours during
appliance operation or
startup.

Additional Heat Exchanger Symptoms
QuestionsYesNo
· An O₂ or CO₂ test indicates
dilution of the flue gases after
the air circulating blower starts
or, in the case of all appliance
types, the O₂ or CO₂ values
cannot be reduced and are
higher over-the-fire compared
to at the breech.
· Soot or oily deposits at the
duct joints or supply registers.
· There are other indicators of
spillage: excessive moisture or
health complaints from the
occupants.
If the visual assessment of the chimney or vent and connector indicates any significant problems, a more
detailed assessment may be required to determine the cause.

Smoke Test for Spillage
This image shows a smoke test conducted at the draft hood to indicate
whether flue gases are spilling into the room or venting properly. Draft
tests or a smoke test may be conducted during the Check portion of the
ACT procedure. Any signs of spillage may justify a basic venting test to
determine the cause of spillage, such as blockage in the chimney.

ACT Procedure: Test Phase
Two simple tests may be conducted if flue gas spillage is suspected. A CO test and a basic venting test are recommended for
all new installations and combustion odour service calls.
CO Test
The test for CO in the ambient air around fuel-fired
appliances should be conducted if flue gas spillage is
suspected. Ensure that a reliable CO detector is employed
and that it is calibrated correctly. Zero adjust it in fresh air
before entering the test area.
Basic Venting Test
The basic venting test requires that all doors are closed and
all exhaust appliances activated. A draft gauge or smoke
pencil is employed to determine if the negative pressure in
the building affects venting.

Basic Venting Test Preparation
Preparation checklist
1. Close all doors and windows except
interior doors to rooms with exhaust
fans.
5. Turn up thermostat
2. Check wind speed. Light winds are
desirable*
6. Turn off hot water valve on gas hot
water heater
3. Turn on all exhaust devices -
dryers, range hood, fans, central
vacuum, HRV on exhaust only mode
etc.
7. Prepare draft gauge or smoke
pencil
4. Turn off heating appliances by their
disconnect switch.
* If weather conditions are unsuitable (too windy or very cold) for the basic test to
simulate worse case conditions, recommend that the basic test be conducted at
another time.

Basic Venting Test Results
Test ResultsYesNo
With the heating appliances off
and cool, is there spillage from
the draft hood, barometric
damper or inspection port of
any of the appliances?
Turn on each appliance
starting with the smallest input
and immediately check for
spillage. Leave each appliance
on as you activate the next one
so all are firing by the end. After
each activation check for
spillage at all test points of all
appliances. Does spillage occur
at any time?
If spillage occurs, does it cease
within 30 seconds?

Completing the Basic Venting
Test
Test ResultsYesNo
Re-open the water
valve and return the
thermostat to the
original setting.
Did the System pass
the spillage test?
If spillage ceased, test is complete and the house passes. If spillage continues, the
house has failed the test. A written notice of the failure must be given the
owner/occupants and the fuel supplier along with a recommendation to conduct
a depressurization test and/or take specific remedial action (listed on form).
Highest carbon monoxide level detected, when/where: _______

Initial Conditions for Basic
Venting Test
This diagram shows the initial conditions for the basic venting test. The
sequence of preparation steps should be followed to prevent problems.
The spillage tests must be conducted as each appliance is activated.
If possible, conduct the spillage tests again after 15 minutes (or more) of
operation as well. If there is more than one appliance, start the smallest
one first and test all spillage points and vent connections. Then activate
the next largest appliance and check for spillage at all points again.

Test Results and Next Steps
If no spillage is found during this test and if you are confident that there is no spillage problem, the customer is simply informed
of the results. However, if spillage was detected during this basic test and/or you have reason to suspect that a spillage
problem exists, a heat exchanger leak test may be warranted or a depressurization test should be conducted by a qualified
tester.

Importance of ACT and
Depressurization Tests
The ACT procedure and depressurization tests are neither commonly
used nor well-known by gas technicians/fitters. You are a new
generation of gas technicians/fitters on whom the gas industry and
customers depend on to identify and resolve new problems.
As building envelopes became more airtight and appliance efficiency
increased by giving up less to the vent, depressurization problems have
increased. The trend toward tighter houses and more efficient
appliances continues, so the spillage problems created by house
depressurization will probably increase.

House Depressurization
Testing
Field tests can be performed to determine the amount of negative
pressure appliances and exhausting equipment are creating. The test is
performed with a hand-held Magnahelic or inclined manometer. These
instruments can measure pressure differences in the 0–60 Pa (0.0–0.25
in w.c.) range.
This field test is not meant as an alternative to the airtightness test
required for the construction and certification of R-2000 and ENERGY
STAR® homes. Those require that a licensed tester confirm the
airtightness of the building envelope by way of a controlled standardized
fan depressurization test, typically using a blower door.

CSA F300 Standard
CSA F300 was developed to address issues and concerns that arise from the
depressurization of existing houses. The standard describes methods for determining the
level of depressurization and solutions to mitigate risk arising from depressurization.
The level of depressurization shall be determined when additions or modifications are made
to any of the following:
Building Envelope
Changes to the airtightness of the structure
Exhaust Device
Addition or modification of exhaust equipment
Combustion Appliance
Changes to heating or other combustion equipment
Appliance Enclosure
Modifications to the space containing combustion equipment

Depressurization Test Overview
Test Purpose
A depressurization test measures the negative pressure in
the building under test conditions. The test conditions may
be:
•Passive - using only the exhaust equipment in the
building (like the basic venting test)
•Active - using a large fan to create a specific negative
pressure (usually -10 Pa or -0.05 inch w.c.)
Safety Warning
Performing depressurization tests, including the basic
venting test, can create dangerous conditions with flue gas
spillage. A CO detector must be employed throughout these
tests.
This ensures that any carbon monoxide released during
testing is detected immediately for safety.

House Depressurization Test Procedure
Prepare the Building
Close and latch all windows, doors, and
other openings. Fill floor drains and
plumbing traps with water or seal. Seal
combustion air inlets and chimneys of flues
for combustion appliances, including
fireplaces and wood stoves.
Set Up Pressure Measurement
Set an exterior pressure tap approximately
at least 3 m (10 ft) from the building and
connect to the measuring device at or near
grade level inside the building.
Establish Baseline
Switch off the ventilation equipment and
any other appliances that exhaust air to the
exterior. This is the starting or "rest"
pressure.

Conducting the
Depressurization Test
Activate Foundation Exhaust
Turn on all foundation exhaust fans (e.g., radon fans) designed for
continued operation.
Add Required Ventilation
Turn on all equipment used to provide the ventilation capacity as
required by the NBC. Record the pressure difference.
Add All Exhaust Equipment
Switch on the dryer and all exhaust equipment with a
capacity over 75 L/s. Record the pressure difference. The
difference between this measurement and the rest pressure
is the maximum house depressurization.

Depressurization Test Setup
This diagram shows the setup for a depressurization test. The pressure
difference between inside and outside the building is measured using a
manometer connected to pressure taps. The exterior pressure tap
should be placed at least 3 meters (10 feet) from the building to avoid
local pressure effects.

Interpreting Test Results
Acceptable Limits
The values you measure must fall within these acceptable
limits:
•Maximum allowable pressure difference is 5 Pa in all
conditions if any non-direct vent fuel fired, vented
combustion appliances are present.
•Maximum allowable pressure difference for other rated
appliances set by the manufacturer.
Exceeding Limits
If the values exceed the acceptable limits, remedial action
must be taken to reduce the depressurization or modify the
combustion appliances to be less susceptible to spillage.
This ensures that combustion gases are properly vented and
do not pose a safety hazard to building occupants.

Solutions for Excessive
Depressurization
Adapt Appliances
Determine which appliance can be adapted or changed
Upgrade Furnace

(odours, dust, and moisture) into the house

HRAI Depressurization Test Report Form
The HRAI Depressurization Test Report Form is a standardized document used to record the results of depressurization
testing. It includes sections for:
•Building and client information
•Test conditions and equipment used
•Baseline pressure readings
•Pressure readings with various exhaust equipment operating
•Calculated depressurization values
•Recommendations for remedial action if needed
This form provides documentation of the test results for both the technician and the homeowner.

Understanding how these components interact is essential for ensuring safe and efficient operation of all building systems.

Trends in Building Construction
Increasing Airtightness
Modern building codes and energy efficiency standards are
driving the construction of increasingly airtight building
envelopes. This reduces energy consumption but can create
challenges for combustion appliances.
Higher Efficiency Appliances
Modern combustion appliances extract more heat from
combustion gases, resulting in cooler flue gases with less
natural buoyancy. This makes proper venting even more
critical.
These trends make understanding depressurization and
proper venting increasingly important for gas technicians.

The Role of Gas Technicians
Safety Guardians
Gas technicians are on the
front line of ensuring
combustion safety in
increasingly complex building
systems.
System Evaluators
Understanding the building as
a system allows technicians to
identify potential issues before
they become safety hazards.
Technical Advisors
Technicians must be able to explain complex building science
concepts to homeowners and recommend appropriate solutions.

Continuing Education
Stay Current with Codes
Building and gas codes are regularly updated to address new
technologies and safety concerns.
Learn New Testing Methods
As testing equipment and procedures evolve, technicians must
stay current with best practices.
Understand New Technologies
New combustion appliances and ventilation systems require
ongoing education to install and service properly.

Resources for Gas Technicians
A variety of resources are available to help gas technicians understand and apply building science principles, including technical manuals, standards
documents, and specialized training programs.

Impact of Moisture and Dust
It can be seen from the preceding tables that excess moisture, dust, and
inadequately vented air contribute in varying degrees to increased
chemical and biological pollution of the indoor environment. Most
control methods relate to ways of removing indoor contaminants and
replenishing stale or over-moist air with fresh air drawn from the external
environment.

Control Priorities for Indoor Air Quality
Source Reduction
Reduce or eliminate the source of pollutants
Ventilation
Improve ventilation to remove pollutants
Filtration
Filter air to remove contaminants

Methods of Controlling Indoor Air
Removal
Store chemicals outside the living
space
Substitution
Non-polluting products should be
chosen in preference to polluting
products
Containment
Store household chemicals in an
airtight, vented cabinet
Control
At the design stage of new
construction or renovation
Air treatment/ventilation
Filtration, HVAC (heating, venting,
and air conditioning)
Humidification and
dehumidification
Add or remove moisture
Local exhaust
Range hoods, bathroom exhausts use filtration and ventilation

Methods of Controlling Air
Contaminants
The diagram above illustrates various methods for controlling air
contaminants in indoor environments. These approaches can be used
individually or in combination to achieve optimal indoor air quality.

Ventilation and Filtration
Ventilation
A good ventilation system has the
overall capacity to ventilate the house,
distribute fresh air to habitable rooms,
include mechanisms to control
pollutants through removal at source,
provide for makeup or relief air, if
necessary, and include an appropriate
ducting and control system.
Filtration
Filtration is the process of passing a
liquid through a device or porous
substance to remove solids or
impurities-the removal of particulates
(not gases) from the air stream.

Common Ventilation
Methods
The image above shows some common ways of providing ventilation in
residential buildings. These methods can be adapted to suit different
building types and ventilation requirements.

National Building Code Requirements
Scope
The National Building Code of Canada
(NBC) and province-specific codes,
such as the Ontario Building Code,
establish requirements for the
ventilation of rooms and spaces in
residential occupancies by natural
ventilation and by mechanical
ventilation systems serving only one
dwelling unit.
Purpose
In a typical house, these target
ventilation rates will dilute air
pollutants generated within the house
(carbon dioxide, humidity, and
odours).
Considerations
In the case of a home located in an area
with poor outdoor air quality,
increasing ventilation may not improve
indoor air quality. Ventilation may
need to be scheduled during periods of
low outdoor pollution levels, such as
early morning.
Caution
Some caution should be exercised as reduced ventilation can
lead to increased levels of indoor air contaminants.
Air Quality Index
Check the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) in your community,
especially during "smog season" from April to September.

General Ventilation Requirements
1
Dwelling Unit Requirements
Every dwelling unit shall incorporate
provisions for non-heating-season
ventilation in accordance with the
NBC. If supplied with electrical
power, provisions for heating
ventilation must be in accordance
with the Code.
2
Non-heating-season
Ventilation
Rooms or spaces in dwelling units
must be ventilated during the non-
heating season by natural ventilation
or by conforming mechanical
ventilation systems.
3
Alternative Ventilation
If a habitable room or space is not provided with natural ventilation as described
above, mechanical ventilation must be provided to exhaust inside air from, or to
introduce outside air to, that room.

Air Change Requirements

## 0.5 

ACH for Cooled Spaces
One-half air change per hour if the room or space is
mechanically cooled during the non-heating season

## 1.0 

ACH for Non-Cooled Spaces
One air change per hour if the room or space is not
mechanically cooled during the non-heating season

Natural Ventilation Requirements
Unobstructed Openings
The unobstructed openable
ventilation area to the outdoors for
rooms and spaces in residential
buildings ventilated by natural
means must conform to Table

## 9.32 .2.2 of the NBC.

Vestibule Ventilation
Where a vestibule opens directly
off a living or dining room within a
dwelling unit, ventilation to the
outdoors for such rooms may be
through the vestibule.
Opening Protection
Openings for natural ventilation
other than windows must be
constructed to provide protection
from the weather and insects.
Screening Requirements
Screening must be of rustproof
material.

Natural Ventilation Area Requirements
LocationMinimum unobstructed area

Evolution of Mechanical Ventilation
Past Assumptions
Until recently, mechanical ventilation was not considered important in
residential buildings
Natural Ventilation
It was assumed that natural ventilation through wind, "stack effect," and
heating appliance operation would create sufficient air movement
Modern Construction
In new houses or older homes brought up to current air tightness standards, it
is no longer sufficient to rely solely on accidental ventilation

HRAI Basic Ventilation Concerns
Proper Air Volume
Bringing in the proper amount of
ventilation air
Air Distribution
Distributing the air to the required
locations
Pressure Balance
Avoiding excessive pressurization or depressurization

Types of Ventilation Systems
Exhaust-Only Systems
Remove air from the home, creating
negative pressure that draws in fresh air
through leaks and intentional openings
Supply-Only Systems
Force fresh air into the home, creating
positive pressure that pushes stale air out
through leaks and intentional openings
Balanced Systems
Provide both supply and exhaust in equal
amounts, maintaining neutral pressure in
the home

Types of Distribution Systems
Direct Ducting
Dedicated ductwork delivers fresh air
directly to living spaces
Recirculating
Uses existing HVAC ductwork to
distribute fresh air throughout the home
Through-the-Wall
Individual units installed through exterior
walls provide ventilation to specific
rooms

Ventilation System Hazards
Supply-Only in Leaky Houses
Can lead to problems with moisture-laden air being driven into wall cavities
Exhaust-Only in Sealed Houses
Can lead to serious health hazards since the depressurization could cause the furnace or fireplace to
backdraft and draw poisonous gases into the house
Excessive Ventilation
Can cost the homeowner more than necessary and may lead to the system being
turned off
Insufficient Ventilation
Can lead to a buildup of pollutants in the air, such as
formaldehyde from new furnishings

Gas Technician Scope of Work
Awareness Requirements
A gas technician/fitter must be aware
of the effects that the ventilation
system has on the building as a system
and on gas appliance operation
Certification Limitations
A gas technician/fitter certificate does
not authorize the holder to install
ventilation systems
Additional Training
Further training is required to design, install, and service ventilation systems that are
part of the gas appliance

Carbon Monoxide Safety
Gas Appliance Operation
Although gas-fired appliances do not
normally produce CO, appliances can
malfunction or backdraft
Building Code Requirements
Therefore, the NBC has requirements
for the installation of CO alarms as a
low-cost backup safety measure

Filtration Systems Overview
Role of Filtration
Filtering the air can reduce some indoor air pollutants, but air
cleaning is rarely effective on its own and should be used in
conjunction with ventilation and reducing contaminants at the
sources
Residential Filters
Although there are many types of furnace air filters available for
the residential market, the majority are designed to protect coils
and heat exchangers of mechanical equipment and have little
impact on air quality

MERV Ratings for Filters
MERV Definition
Filters have a minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) rating that indicates how
effectively they trap particles
Rating Scale
The scale is designed to represent the worst-case performance of a filter when
dealing with particles in the range of 0.3-10 μm
Rating Range
The MERV rating is from 1 to 16. Higher MERV ratings correspond to a greater
percentage of particles captured on each pass, with a MERV 16 filter capturing
more than 95% of particles over the full range
Common Ratings
MERV 8 filters are common although an R-2000 home requires a minimum
MERV 13 filter

Portable Air Cleaners
HEPA Filters
Portable air cleaners, particularly
high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)
filters and electrostatic precipitators,
can reduce some air contaminants
HEPA filters collect 99.95% of particle
pollutants that have a size greater
than or equal to 0.3 μm
Limitations
Air cleaners can be effective in
removing particles, but most do not
remove gases

Ventilation System Effectiveness
Balanced HRV/ERVSupply-OnlyExhaust-OnlyNatural Ventilation
This chart illustrates the relative effectiveness of different ventilation system types in maintaining indoor air quality. Balanced systems with heat or energy recovery ventilators (HRV/ERV) are the most
effective, followed by supply-only and exhaust-only systems, with natural ventilation being the least effective overall.

Air Change Requirements by Room
This chart shows the required air change rates for different rooms in a dwelling according to the National Building Code. Master bedrooms and basements require the highest ventilation rates at
10 L/s, while other rooms require 5 L/s.

Filter MERV Rating Effectiveness
This chart illustrates the particle capture efficiency of air filters with different MERV ratings. Higher MERV ratings correspond to greater filtration efficiency, with MERV 16 filters capturing 95%
of particles and MERV 4 filters capturing only 20%.
