Code Reference
CSA B149.1 clause specifying
underground piping requirements
Additional depth of cover shall be required where the piping is located in areas where
physical damage is likely to occur, such as farm operations.

Underground Piping Installation
Standard Installation
Piping entering a building shall rise above grade before
entry, unless otherwise permitted by the authority having
jurisdiction.
This is the preferred method as it reduces the risk of water
infiltration and damage to the building foundation.

Below Grade Entry
Exceptions
Watertight Seal
You must provide a
watertight seal where the
piping passes through an
outside wall below grade
Sleeve or Protection
Piping or tubing passing
through concrete or
masonry walls must have a
sleeve, coating, or double-
wrap
Footing Restrictions
Piping may not pass under a footing or building wall because
building settlement can cause crushing or rupture of the pipe

Supports for Piping
Clause 6.8.3 of CSA B149.1 states that you must install aboveground piping
with individual supports of sufficient strength and quality and space it
according to Table 6.2.
Pipe Size (NPS)Maximum Spacing of Supports ft
(m)
1/2 or less - horizontal6 (2)
3/4-1 - horizontal8 (2.5)
1-1/4-2-1/2 - horizontal10 (3)
3-4 - horizontal15 (5)
6 - horizontal20 (6)
8-12 or larger - horizontal24 (7)

Rooftop Piping Requirements
Support Requirements
Piping must have support according to the distances outlined in Table 6.2,
plus support at each change of direction and at each threaded connection
Support Materials
Rooftop supports should be treated wood blocks and pipe clamps, with
protection for the roof membrane
Certified Supports
Certified rooftop pipe supports are also now available on the market
Expansion Requirements
When a rooftop piping run exceeds 100 ft in length in any one direction, a
piping offset (expansion loop) is required

Rooftop Piping Expansion Solutions
Expansion Loops
When a rooftop piping run exceeds 100 ft in length in any
one direction, a piping offset (expansion loop) is required to
allow for expansion of the piping system as it heats with sun
exposure.
This can be either:
•A site-assembled piping offset (see Annex G of CSA
B149.1)
•An engineered expansion joint
Both solutions allow expansion of piping to occur without
damaging or breaking fittings and causing leaks. See Clause

## 6.25 of CSA B149.1.


Rooftop Piping Protection
Corrosion Protection
All piping exposed to atmospheres that could cause corrosion must
have either painting or coating for protection.
Steel piping systems are typically installed on commercial rooftops
and must have two coats of quality rust proof paint.
UV Protection
Yellow jacket PVC factory coatings should not be used as they break
down and deteriorate with UV exposure and may lead to premature
corrosion of the pipe.
See Clause 6.16 of CSA B149.1 for specific requirements.

Underground Piping Installation
Requirements
Proper Grading
Trenches for piping
must undergo proper
grading to avoid any
sagging in the pipes
or tubes
Backfill Material
Backfill material must
be free of sharp
objects, large stones,
or other material that
may damage the
piping
Tracer Wire
A tracer wire or the
equivalent must
accompany buried
plastic piping
Venting
Requirements
When paving covers
the piping or extends
25 ft (8 m) or more
from the building, a
vent pipe inspection
point must be
installed

Venting Requirements for Paved Areas
Requirements
When paving covers the piping or the paving extends 25 ft
(8 m) or more from the building:
•You must install a vent pipe inspection point
•You should provide a sleeve in the pavement to permit
free movement of piping
•This sleeve can also serve as a vent pipe inspection point

Identification of Gas Piping
Option 1: Full Painting
The entire piping or tubing system
shall be painted yellow
Option 2: Yellow Banding
The piping or tubing system shall be
provided with yellow banding that
has a minimum width of 1 in (25 mm)
Option 3: Labeling
The piping or tubing system shall be
labeled or marked "GAS" or
"PROPANE", as applicable, utilizing
yellow labels or markings
When identified using banding or labels, the identification intervals shall not exceed 20 ft (6 m). For supply piping systems
carrying pressures 2 psi and over, you must identify and label the supply pressure in addition to the above identification
procedures.

Shut-off Valves
Clause 6.18 of the Code describes manual valve requirements for large
piping installations. A manual shut-off valve shall be certified to CSA 3.11,
CSA 3.16, or ANSI Z21.15/CSA 9.1, or approved for use with gas, and it
shall not be subjected to either a temperature or a pressure outside of its
certified rating range.
Readily Accessible
You must install a "readily
accessible" manual shut-off
valve for each appliance
Proper Location
In either the drop or riser as
close as possible to the
valve train of a commercial
and industrial-type
appliance
Distance Requirements
Within 50 ft of the residential appliance it serves

Shut-off Valve Locations
Between Buildings
Piping that extends between buildings must have a shut-off
valve at the point of exit from the first building and one at
the point of entry to the adjoining building.
This ensures that each building can be isolated in case of
emergency or maintenance.

Multiple Outlet Shut-off Valves
Master Shut-off Valve
When a classroom, laboratory, or similar room or area contains
multiple outlets, a clearly marked master shut-off valve in a
readily accessible location within the room must be present for
controlling them.
This allows for quick emergency shut-off of all gas outlets in the
room from a single location.
Valve Controlling Several Systems
When a shut-off valve controls several piping systems, it shall
be:
•Readily accessible for operation at all times
•Provided with an installed handle
•Installed to provide protection from damage
•Clearly marked with an enamelled metal, substantial fibre, or
other permanent tag

Test Firing Valve
Location and Requirements
The test firing valve is found on commercial and industrial
valve trains downstream of all safety controls and
components and as close as possible to the burner of the
appliance.
It must be a 1/4 turn valve with handle installed.
You may find this valve simply as a manually operated ball
valve on laboratory-certified equipment and as a lubricated
plug valve on field-approved equipment.
Importance
Although simple in operation, the test firing valve may be
considered the most important valve on the valve train.
When in the closed position, it allows testing of safeties and
flame safeguard controls without allowing gas into the
combustion chamber, thereby minimizing the risk of
backfire or explosion.
Any lubricated valve requires periodic greasing to ensure
the valve will function when needed.

Bonding of Metal Gas Piping and
Tubing
Bonding is a low impedance path obtained by permanently joining all non-current-
carrying metal parts to ensure electrical continuity and having the capacity to
conduct safely any current likely to be imposed on it.
Equipotential Bonding
The Canadian Electrical Code
requires equipotential bonding for
the continuous metal gas piping
system of a building supplied with
electric power
Purpose
The objective is to establish
equipotentiality, the state in
which conductive parts are at a
substantially equal electric
potential
CSST Concerns
Special concerns exist around bonding Corrugated Stainless-Steel Tubing
Systems (CSST), and manufacturers have revised bonding requirements

Bonding Requirements
Bonding Jumper Requirements
The bonding jumper shall not be smaller than:
•No. 6 AWG copper
•No. 4 AWG aluminum
Care should be taken not to have aluminum bonding conductors in contact with
copper piping.
Code Requirements
Clause 4.7.3 of CSA B149.1 requires:
"All interior metal gas piping that may become energized shall be made
electrically continuous and shall be bonded in accordance with the requirements
of the local electrical code, or in absence of such, the Canadian Electrical Code,
Part I."
The Canadian Electrical Code forbids the use of gas piping as an electrical
ground.

Bonding vs. Grounding
Bonding
"A low impedance path obtained by permanently joining all
non-current-carrying metal parts to ensure electrical
continuity and having the capacity to conduct safely any
current likely to be imposed on it."
Purpose: Ensures electrical continuity between metal parts
Grounding
"A permanent and continuous conductive path to the earth
with sufficient ampacity to carry any fault current liable to be
imposed on it, and of a sufficiently low impedance to limit
the voltage rise above ground and to facilitate the operation
of the protective devices in the circuit."
Purpose: Connects system to earth
The overall objective for grounding and bonding is to minimize the likelihood and severity of electric shock by establishing
equipotentiality between exposed non-current-carrying conductive surfaces and nearby surfaces of the earth and to prevent
damage to property during a fault.

Commercial Cooking Appliances
Clause 6.21.5 of CSA B149.1 stipulates that commercial cooking appliances certified for use with casters or otherwise subject to
movement during cleaning and other large gas utilization equipment that can be moved shall be connected by a certified gas
connector that is certified to either ANSI Z21.69/CSA 6.16 or ANSI Z21.101/CSA 8.5.
Certified Connectors
Movable commercial cooking
appliances must be connected by
a certified connector specifically
designed for this application
Restraining Device
When a gas connector is used
with a commercial cooking
appliance installed on wheels or
rollers, a noncombustible
restraining device shall be
provided to protect the gas
connector
Clearance Requirements
A noncombustible, fixed means
for maintaining a minimum 6
inch clearance between
combustible materials and the
sides and rear of the appliance

Approved Joining Methods Overview
This section reviews the different types of piping and tubing systems that the industry uses for gas and their associated valves
and fittings and describes approved joining methods for gas piping and tubing.
Welding
Required for large piping and
underground systems
Threading
Common for steel pipe connections
Flanging
Used for larger diameter connections
Compression Fittings
Approved for certain applications

Underground Piping Joining
Requirements
CSA B149.1 requires the threading, flanging, and welding of joints in steel piping. However,
Clause 6.15.2 specifies that underground piping systems be joined or connected by welding,
approved mechanical compression fittings or press-connect fittings.
Welding Requirements
For all practical purposes, welding is the acceptable method for joining large
underground piping.
The Boiler and Pressure Vessels Act governs certification requirements and procedures
related to welding.
Alternative Methods
In some cases, approved mechanical compression fittings or press-connect fittings
may be used for underground piping systems.
Always consult the authority having jurisdiction for specific requirements in your area.

General Requirements for Piping
and Tubing

inspected for 100% of the weld length

Gasket and Lubricant Requirements
Gasket Materials
Gasket materials must be of neoprene or a similar material
that resists any action of gas.
Natural rubber is not acceptable for gas applications as it
can deteriorate when exposed to gas.
Gaskets must be rated for the pressure and temperature
conditions they will experience in service.
Lubricants
A lubricant used in either a valve or a control shall be of a
type approved for gas use.
It shall be capable of withstanding the service conditions to
which it can be subjected when used in accordance with the
manufacturer's recommendations.
Special gas-approved pipe dope or thread sealant must be
used on threaded connections.

Iron and Galvanized Steel Piping
Steel gas piping must conform to ASTM specification A53/A53M or A106 as described in Clause

## 6.2 .1 of CSA B149.1. Black pipe is most commonly used for gas with pipe fittings of steel or malleable

iron.
Nominal Pipe Size
(NPS)
The industry uses NPS for
sizing black pipe used for gas
systems
Consistent Outside
Diameter
For any nominal size of pipe,
the outside diameter (OD)
remains the same and the
inside diameter (ID) changes
as the wall thickness increases
Threaded Ends
Pipe is threaded on the outside
only; therefore the OD must
remain constant
Nominal Size
A designation used for the
purpose of general
identification

Pipe End Types
Types of Pipe Ends
You may finish the ends of gas piping and tubing in the
following ways, depending on the application:
•Plain: Straight cut with no additional finishing, used for
compression fittings or welding preparation
•Bevelled: Angled cut on the edge, primarily used for
welded connections
•Threaded: Machine-cut threads for use with threaded
fittings
The type of end finish required depends on the joining
method to be used and the application requirements.

Pipe Wall Thickness
Schedule 40
The gas industry uses Schedule 40 or Schedule 80 steel
pipe for gas systems. Schedule refers to the wall thickness
of the pipe.
Schedule 40 pipe is standard weight and is the most
commonly used for gas piping systems in normal
applications.
Schedule 80
Schedule 80 is extra heavy weight pipe with thicker walls
for higher pressure applications or where additional
strength is required.
Schedule 40 and Schedule 80 pipe have the same outside
diameter (OD), but different inside diameters (ID) due to
the wall thickness difference.

Pipe Markings and Labels
You must mark and label the piping you use for gas systems as described in
Clause 6.17 of CSA B149.1.
1
Full Yellow Paint
The entire piping or tubing
system shall be painted
yellow
2
Yellow Banding
The piping or tubing system
shall be provided with yellow
banding that has a minimum
width of 1 in (25 mm)
3
Labeling
The piping or tubing system shall be labeled or marked "GAS" or
"PROPANE", as applicable, utilizing yellow labels or markings
When identified in accordance with options 2 or 3, the identification
intervals shall not exceed 20 ft (6 m).

Pressure Test Before Appliance Installation
Isolate the System
Disconnect the system from any gas source
Cap Open Ends
Seal all open pipe ends
Install Pressure Gauge
Connect calibrated gauge to system
Pressurize System
Apply air or inert gas to required test pressure
Monitor for Required Duration
Observe for pressure drop per code requirements

Leak Test After Appliance Installation
Connect Appliances
Install all appliances to the piping system
Visual Inspection
Check for any openings in the system
Calibrated Gauge
Use gauge calibrated in 1 in w.c. (250 Pa) increments
Perform Test
Test using gas supply at normal static pressure for minimum 10 minutes
Check Connections
Apply leak detector solution to all connections

Soap Test for Leak Detection
Soap Test Procedure
The soap test is a simple but effective method for detecting
gas leaks:
1.Prepare a solution of soap and water (commercial leak
detector solutions are also available)
2.Apply the solution to each joint or fitting in the suspect
portion of the system
3.Watch carefully for bubble formation, which indicates a
leak
4.Mark any leaking joints for repair
5.After repairs, retest to confirm the leak has been fixed
This method is particularly useful for finding small leaks that
might not cause a noticeable pressure drop during testing.
The formation of bubbles provides a visual indication of the
exact location of the leak.

Checking for Shut-off Valve
Seepage
Pressurize System
Bring the system to a static pressure condition
Release Pressure
Release a small amount of the contained gas pressure by quickly
removing, then replacing, the manometer or pressure gauge tubing
Allow Repressurization
This action opens the service regulator and allows repressurization of
the system back to the gas meter shut-off valve
Observe Pressure
If the gas pressure increases slowly to static pressure, the meter
valve is seeping gas and should undergo servicing before testing
proceeds

See Clause 6.16 of CSA B149.1 for specific requirements regarding protection of
piping exposed to corrosive atmospheres.
All protective coatings must be maintained to ensure continued protection
throughout the life of the installation.

Underground Piping Trenching Requirements
Trench Preparation
Trenches for piping must undergo proper grading to avoid
any sagging in the pipes or tubes.
The trench bottom should be smooth and free of rocks or
debris that could damage the pipe.
Proper sloping may be required to ensure drainage away
from the pipe.
Backfill Requirements
Backfill material must be free of sharp objects, large stones,
or other material that may damage the piping.
Initial backfill around the pipe should be with fine material,
carefully placed and compacted.
Final backfill can use excavated material if suitable, but must
still be free of large rocks or debris.

Tracer Wire Requirements

corrosion

Vent Pipe Inspection Points
Requirements
When paving covers the piping or the paving extends 25 ft
(8 m) or more from the building:
•You must install a vent pipe inspection point
•This allows for monitoring of the underground piping
space for potential gas leaks
•It also provides access for inspection and testing of the
underground system
Sleeve Requirements
You should provide a sleeve in the pavement to permit free
movement of piping.
This sleeve can also serve as a vent pipe inspection point.
The sleeve prevents damage to the pipe from pavement
movement due to temperature changes, settling, or traffic
loads.

Chapter 2
Welding Safety,
Certification, and
Procedures
Having any type of welding certification is not a requirement for gas
technicians/fitters. However, a gas technician/fitter cannot perform any
type of welding without having received certification as a welder.
Additionally, testing and accreditation of a certified welder is a must to
perform an approved gas pipe welding procedure before obtaining legal
certification to weld gas piping.
As a gas technician/fitter, you should have a thorough understanding of
welding requirements and safety procedures, along with knowledge of
welding-related hazards, in order to protect yourself when in the
presence of welding activities.

Common Welding Hazards
Being a gas technician/fitter does not require you to hold a welding ticket. However, since you will be working alongside a
welder for all welding operations, you must be aware of a number of hazards and safety issues related to welding.
Physical Hazards
•Various types of radiation
•Visible light
•Noise
•Electrical energy
Chemical Hazards
•Flammable and combustible
products
•Welding fumes and toxic gases
•Dust
Environmental Hazards
•Extremes of temperature
•Poor ventilation
•Biological hazards

Physical Hazards: Ionizing Radiation
X-rays and Gamma Rays
X-rays and gamma rays produce ionizing radiation during
the welding process. These rays are:
•Emitted from equipment for gauging the density and
thickness of pipes and to check welds
•Invisible forms of ionizing radiation and can be extremely
damaging to unprotected parts of the body
You must completely shield welding chambers to confine X-
rays and protect the welder.
Ionizing radiation can cause serious health issues if proper
shielding and protection are not used. Always follow safety
protocols when working near equipment that produces X-
rays or gamma rays.

Physical Hazards: Non-ionizing Radiation
Ultraviolet (UV) Radiation
Produced by the arc or from a
reflection off bright objects like white
clothing or shiny metal. Without
adequate eye protection, you could
suffer from arc flash, a burnt and
blistered condition of the eyeballs.
Eyes become watery and painful in
the period up to 24 hours after
exposure and the condition can last
up to five days. It is usually reversible,
but repeated exposure can result in
scar tissue and impaired vision.
Infrared and Visible Light
Prolonged exposure can cause
chronic conjunctivitis and other eye
ailments.
Even clear lens safety glass with side
shields marked for UV protection can
provide a minimum level of
protection by reflecting the light.
Protection Requirements
You should wear appropriate eye
protection at all times when working
within the vicinity of welding to
reduce the risk of eye damage and
skin burn and blistering in extreme
exposure to UV rays.

Physical Hazards: Fire and Flying Metal
Fire Hazards
The high temperatures involved in welding produce hot
metal and sparks which can present dangers in many forms.
Flying metal particles, sparks, and slag are hazardous to
eyes, skin, and readily combustible clothing material.
Your clothing or elsewhere around welding or cutting
operations must never carry or have plastic butane lighters.
If the casing on the lighter were to come into contact with
hot slag, it would melt and explode, causing damage that
could be fatal.
Noise Hazards
Substantial hearing loss has been observed in welders as a
result of the high noise levels from sources such as grinding,
machining, polishing, hammering, and removing slag.
Proper hearing protection is essential when working in or
around welding operations.

Chemical Hazards: Pure Oxygen
Combustion Danger
The combination of pure oxygen (O₂) with other materials is a potential
combustion danger.
Increased Flammability
Materials that burn in air burn much more readily when exposed to O₂.
Other materials that may not burn in air become combustible in O₂.
Oil and Grease Hazards
Either oil or grease, not normally thought of as highly flammable, can
cause explosion when brought into contact with pure oxygen.
Cylinder Safety
Oxygen cylinders are pressurized containers. You should never attempt
to repair a faulty cylinder.

Chemical Hazards: Acetylene
Properties of Acetylene
Acetylene gas (C₂H₂) used in welding work is a colourless,
unstable compound. However, even very small quantities of
acetylene produce a pungent odour that is quite noticeable.
Since any mixture of oxygen and acetylene is regarded as
explosive, ensure you take immediate precautions if you
smell acetylene.
The term "unstable" means that the material is likely to
break down (decompose) or undergo a physical change
without much provocation or cause. The point at which this
happens is what you call its critical point.
Critical Points and Safety
The critical point of pure acetylene is 28 psi (193 kPa)
pressure at 70°F (21°C). At this point, acetylene breaks down
into carbon and hydrogen and results in an explosion from
the hydrogen gas.
If you increase the temperature, the pressure at which
acetylene becomes critical drops. To allow for any
temperature fluctuations in the work area, do not store or
use free acetylene at pressures over 15 psi (103 kPa).

Storage of Gas Cylinders
Secure Storage Location
You must store cylinders where no falling object, passing vehicle, or person
can damage or knock them over.
Avoid Corrosive Environments
Cylinders should not come into contact with salt, corrosive chemicals, or
fumes.
Secure Cylinders Upright
Whether they are full or empty, you should always secure cylinders upright to
a stationary object, such as a wall or portable cart, to keep them from falling
down.
Separate Full and Empty
Empty containers should be chained to one wall and full containers separated
and chained to the opposite wall.

Portable Oxy-Acetylene Equipment
Portable Cart Design
A portable oxy-acetylene outfit has the acetylene and
oxygen containers separately chained to a cart in an upright
position.
The cylinder cart is designed to roll easily when tilted back
on its wheels, yet be stable and secure when it is stationary.
This design ensures safe transport of the cylinders while
maintaining proper storage orientation and security.

Other Chemical Hazards
Flammable Products
Many chemicals used in or around welding operations are highly flammable and pose significant fire risks if not properly handled and stored.
Toxic Gases and Fumes
Welding processes can produce various toxic gases and fumes that can cause respiratory issues and other health problems if inhaled.
Flammable Dust
Certain types of dust generated during welding preparation or cleaning can become flammable when suspended in air, creating explosion risks.

Environmental Hazards
Ventilation Issues
Inadequate ventilation of welding shops or confined work areas
produces dangerously toxic, combustible, or inflammable
conditions.
Proper ventilation is essential to remove harmful fumes and
maintain safe air quality in welding environments.
Temperature Extremes
Extremes of temperature during welding can cause excessive,
sometimes life-threatening, effects:
ExtremeEffect
HeatCauses muscle cramps,
dehydration, sudden
collapse, and
unconsciousness
ColdLeads to fatigue, irregular
breathing, lowered blood
pressure, confusion, and
loss of consciousness

Protective Clothing for Welding
Complete Protection
Heavy clothing fabric that sheds sparks is
recommended for wear around welding
operations. Leather is best, but heavy
denim is adequate and more practical.
Wear clothing that is in good condition,
with no holes or frayed areas, and free of
grease and oil that covers all exposed
skin.
Hand and Arm Protection
Wear gauntlet-type gloves to protect
hands and forearms from sparks, heat,
and radiation. Proper gloves are essential
for preventing burns and other injuries
during welding operations.
Eye and Face Protection
Wear adequate eye and face protection
against visible light rays, ultra-violet light
rays, infrared rays, heat rays, and flying
metal particles, sparks and slag. Gas
technicians/fitters working with welders
should wear flash goggles.

Additional Protective Equipment
Head Protection
Cover and protect head and hair by wearing a cap or other protective
headgear to prevent burns from falling sparks or slag.
Foot Protection
Protect your feet with steel-toed boots to prevent injury from falling objects
or hot metal.
Proper Clothing
Wear cuffless pants and make sure there are no hanging pieces of light fabric
or jewelry attached to your clothing. Ensure your shirt pockets have flaps.
Respiratory Protection
In special circumstances, you may have to wear a respirator or mask to
protect against harmful fumes and gases.

Fire Prevention
Follow Fire Prevention
Orders
Strictly follow all fire prevention
orders at the work site. The high
temperatures involved in welding
can quickly cause extreme danger
of fire and explosion in
combustible surroundings and
when flammable equipment and
materials are in use.
Fire Watch Requirements
There must be someone
assigned—someone who is
equipped with and trained in the
proper use of fire extinguishers—
to carry out a "fire-watch"
whenever welding or oxy-fuel
cutting must take place.
Monitoring Duration
The monitoring duration should not be less than 30 min after completion of
any welding or cutting process, and you may determine it to be longer
depending on the environment.

Oxy-Acetylene Equipment
Oxygen and Flame Temperature
The addition of oxygen to the flame increases the flame
temperature and produces a smaller, more concentrated
heat source. Oxygen is combined with acetylene or propane
utilizing specialized burner tips that provide a hotter, more
controllable flame suitable for brazing procedures on gas
tubing systems.
Safety Features
Oxygen cylinders have protection from heat-caused
extreme pressure by means of a fusible metal rupture disk
that controls the slow escape of gas.
Oxygen is a critical component of the combustion triangle
(along with fuel and ignition heat). In its concentrated form,
it can lower the ignition temperature of any fuel.

Rules for Working with Oxy-Acetylene Equipment
Do
•Keep oxy-acetylene equipment away from oil or grease
•If a cylinder appears to be leaking or faulty, remove it to the
outside, leave it in the open, tag it to indicate its fault, and
notify the supplier
•Use the cylinder in a vertical position to prevent acetone
from being drawn off
•Store cylinders in a cool area
•If your cylinder has a key-type acetylene valve, open it only
1-1/2 turns. Fully open the hand-wheel type
•Test for leaks using a soap test (never test near an open
flame)
Do Not/Never
•Never use oxygen as a compressed air substitute
•Never use oxygen to start or run internal combustion
engines
•Never use oxygen to blow out pipe or tubing lines
•Never use oxygen to create pressure
•Never use oxygen for ventilation
•Never use oxygen to dust off clothing or work areas
•Never oil regulators or torch parts
•Never attempt to repair a leaking or faulty cylinder yourself
•Never transfer acetylene from one cylinder to another

Oxy-Propane Equipment
Heat Properties
While propane does not burn as hot
as acetylene in its inner cone, it
does have a high heat value in its
outer cone. So, with the right torch
(injector-style), propane can make
a faster and cleaner cut than
acetylene and is effective for
brazing.
Economic Advantages
Propane is also cheaper than
acetylene and easier to transport,
making it a cost-effective
alternative for certain applications.
Equipment Design
Most propane tips are of a two-
piece design. Most torches are
designed for equal fuel and oxygen
pressure and for gases, such as
acetylene, which are lighter than
oxygen. Propane is a heavier fuel
and runs much better through a
low-pressure injector torch with a
wider range of pressure settings.

Red Seal Endorsement
An Interprovincial Standards Welder Red Seal is an
endorsement that a Trades Person may achieve by meeting
requirements established by the provincial or territorial
apprenticeship authority and writing and successfully
passing the Red Seal Welder Exam (C of Q).
Though achieving this designation is a recognition of
achievement of a "standard of excellence" interprovincially,
you should note that the Welder Red Seal certification is a
trade theory examination and does not certify a welder to
weld on boiler and Pressure vessels or any piping associated
with the system in question.

welding), which has different
applications and requirements.
Code Limitations
CSA W59 is not intended to apply to pressure vessels or to structures
governed by special codes such as those of the American Petroleum
Institute, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, or the
American Water Works Association.

Preparation for Welding
Shielded metal arc welding is the process you normally use for welding steel gas piping. However, the welding procedures for this process fall beyond the scope of this
Chapter and would not be part of a gas technician's/fitter's normal duties. The layout of welded piping systems is the gas technician's/fitter's responsibility and may
include such tasks as measuring, marking, cutting, joint preparation, and assembly.
Measuring
Select pipe sizes and measure lengths
Marking
Mark locations of joints and connectors
Cutting
Cut pipe to proper lengths
Joint Preparation
Prepare pipe ends for welding
Assembly
Assemble the piping system

Measuring Pipe and Fittings
Piping Drawings
Piping drawings represent each pipe by a single line you
draw along the centre of the pipe, with the meeting of lines
representing the fittings. Dimension lines are what you draw
parallel to the length in question, with arrows in opposite
directions pointing toward the boundaries of the
measurement.
A segment of a piping system with the dimensions 7-7/8 in
(200 mm) end-to-centre of pipe. This does not mean that
you must cut the pipe exactly 7-7/8 in long, since you must
allow for fittings.

Centre Line Measurements
Centre point of a fitting. The tee makes up part of the 7-7/8 in
(200 mm), while a 1/8 in (3 mm) root gap and a length of pipe
will make up the rest.
Measuring Along Centre Lines
Measure pipe length along centre lines. Where two centre
lines cross, place a centre point in a fitting. The dimension 7-
7/8 in (200 mm) refers to the total distance between centre
point A and point B.
This is what you call an end-to-centre measurement. To find
the correct length to cut the pipe, you have to measure the
fitting using the following procedure:
1.Measure the distance between the centre point and the
point where the pipe will end.
2.Subtract this fitting allowance from the dimension shown
on the drawing.
3.This dimension-minus-fitting allowance is the correct
length to cut the pipe.

Common Weld Fittings
To calculate the fitting allowances for weld fittings, there are two options: You could make field measurements, or you could refer to a table showing various
dimensions for butt weld fittings. These tables typically show Imperial Units of measurement, since these are the most widely used measurements for pipe
and fitting dimensions.

Marking the Cutting Line
Using a Wraparound
For a square cut, you may use wraparound and a piece of
soapstone to accurately mark the cutting line. A wraparound
is a strip of leather belting or other strong, flexible material
approximately 4 in (100 mm) wide.
The wraparound should be long enough to go around the
pipe at least 1-1/2 times. The edges must be perfectly
straight.
Marking Procedure
Use the following procedure to mark a straight line around
the pipe:
1.Place one edge of the wraparound against the point at
which you must cut the pipe.
2.Circle the pipe with the wraparound and line up the
edges accurately.
3.Use the wraparound edge as a guide to draw a line
around the pipe with a piece of soapstone.

Cutting Pipe and Tubing
Pipe Cutting and Beveling Machine
Gas technicians/fitters use a variety of
methods to cut pipe and tubing. On piping
being prepared for welding, you must bevel
the pipe end to accommodate the welding
procedure. A pipe cutting and beveling
machine can be used to both cut and
prepare the pipe end in one operation.
Pipe Cutters
Pipe cutters are frequently used on small
pipes. You may also use them on larger
piping. After cutting, an angle grinder is
often used to bevel the end to suit the
welding requirements.
Angle Grinders
After cutting with a pipe cutter or cut-off
saw, an angle grinder is used to bevel the
pipe end to the proper angle for welding.
This creates the necessary preparation for a
strong, reliable weld joint.

Oxy-Acetylene Cutting
Cutting Large Diameter Pipe
An oxy-acetylene torch is what you often use to cut large
diameter pipe. The piping is bevel cut with the torch by hand
or by placing the torch in a machine that is angled to suit the
bevel.
Final Preparation
The end is then further prepared with an angle grinder to
ensure the proper bevel angle and smooth surface for
welding.
This combination of torch cutting and grinding provides an
efficient method for preparing large diameter pipe for
welding operations.

Pipe and Fitting Alignment
Importance of Proper Alignment
As a gas technician/fitter, you must ensure the pipe
fitting and alignment is correct before any tacking or
welding of fittings, valves, or pipe to avoid weld failure
and system malfunction.
Preparation Requirements
Fitting and alignment work must include preparation
of pipe ends, assembling and gapping joints, alignment
of pipe and fittings to other parts of the piping, and
tacking.
Beveling Requirements
To prepare pressure pipe for butt welding or matching
of fittings, V-bevel the ends to an angle of
approximately 37-1/2°. Note that the bevel does not
come to a sharp point but has a flat portion of
approximately 1/16-1/8 in (1.6-3.2 mm) according to
the weld procedure.
Land or Root Face
The land helps in preventing the sharp edges of the
bevel from burning off during welding. Note that
welded pipe fittings and pipe lengths come with
standard bevelled ends that only require cleaning.

Joint Assembly
Gap and Alignment Requirements
Before tacking, it is important to assemble and gap together
the pipe and fittings. The gap (or root) opening between the
two ends is evenly spaced at 1/16-1/8 in (1.6-3.2 mm)
according to the weld procedure.
Besides maintaining the gap between the bevelled ends, the
inside and the outside surfaces of the joint must match
evenly without high or low spots.
Alignment Methods
Clamps are what you often use to maintain the correct gap
and high-low alignment. On smaller pipe and fitting sizes, an
angle iron helps maintain proper alignment.
These alignment tools ensure that the pipe sections are
properly positioned before welding begins, which is critical
for creating strong, reliable welds.

Tacking Procedures
Purpose of Tack Welds
Gas technicians/fitters make tack welds in aligned and
gapped pipe and fittings to hold the piping in place during
complete welding operations.
A common method is to make four tack welds evenly spaced
around each joint. The tack weld should be three times the
thickness of the pipe wall.
Tacking Procedure
1.When you use a spacer wire, remove the wire after
welding the first tack.
2.Make the second tack 180° opposite the first tack.
3.Make the third and fourth tacks at 90° angles to the first
and second tacks.
4.When making the third tack, adjust the gap until the
openings are equalized.

Tack Weld Positioning
Strategic Placement
If one side of the root opening is slightly wider, place the
third tack weld at that point, since any shrinkage in the third
tack weld, when cooling, will even out the root opening
space by contracting and "pulling" together the third tack.
The fourth tack weld is at 180° from the third tack. This
orientation and order of tack welds helps maintain proper
alignment and gap spacing during the complete welding
process.

Pressure Testing
Standard Testing
Methods
You perform pressure testing
of welded pipe to Code
requirements using normal
pressure testing methods with
air or an inert gas.
Non-Destructive
Testing
Other non-destructive testing
that the Code may require
includes radiographic testing
and liquid dye testing.
Code Compliance
All testing must comply with the relevant code requirements to
ensure the safety and integrity of the welded pipe system.

Radiographic Testing
X-ray Inspection
You may conduct radiographic (X-ray) testing upon a
customer's request, or according to job specifications.
Radiographic testing must adhere to Section 5, Article 2 of
the ASME BPVC.
When the testing is complete, you must submit the
radiograph to the inspector for acceptance.
Benefits of Radiographic Testing
Radiographic testing allows for non-destructive inspection
of welds, revealing internal defects that might not be visible
from the surface.
This method provides a permanent record of the weld
quality and is particularly important for critical applications
where weld integrity is essential for safety.

Liquid (Dye) Penetrant Examination
Apply Penetrant
Apply colored or fluorescent dye penetrant to the weld surface
Allow Dwell Time
Let the penetrant seep into any surface defects
Remove Excess
Clean the surface to remove excess penetrant
Apply Developer
Apply developer to draw penetrant from defects
Inspect
Examine for indications of defects

Types of Dye Penetrant Testing
Color Contrast Method
Section 5, Article 6, of the ASME BPVC sets out
requirements for liquid (dye) penetrant examination of
welded piping where you allow the part being tested to dry
and apply a "developer". The penetrant shows through the
developer if any faults are present.
The dyes in the penetrant are visible under white light
(colour contrast) for easy identification of surface defects.
Fluorescent Method
Alternatively, fluorescent dyes can be used that become
visible under ultraviolet light, providing enhanced detection
capabilities for very small defects.
This method is particularly useful for detecting fine cracks
and other small surface discontinuities that might be missed
with the color contrast method.

Utility and Non-Utility Piping
A gas technician/fitter must be prepared to install various types of pipe
and tubing, as well as recognize many other types. Piping can carry
substances other than gas, and the type of piping is not always an
indicator of what is inside. A basic understanding of how one identifies
piping on drawings and on the work site is important to ensure safe and
efficient installation and repairs.

Utility Piping and Tubing
Piping and tubing in existing buildings or underground pipe lines are not
always clearly identified. As a gas technician/fitter, you may have to work
on or isolate an area of piping or tubing and be sure of how to determine
which piping or tubing conveys what. This is not always easily done, but
there are certain steps you can take to ensure that the contents of a
sealed line can be clearly identified.

Underground Piping
Piping is run underground to carry a variety of things from
one place to another, such as electricity, water, sewage, and
gas.
The location and identification of underground piping is
important whenever you perform work that might affect or
come in contact with underground lines. The relevant utility
blueprint all utility lines at first installation and update the
plan drawings whenever there have been changes to
existing systems. The utility will supply a drawing of area
piping when required for digging, new construction etc.
Gas service lines normally run in a straight line from the
distribution line at the street to the gas meter.
Underground gas piping will either be wrapped steel pipe or
polyethylene plastic pipe.

Types of Underground Gas
Piping
Wrapped Steel
•Coated with polyethylene
•Coloured either blue or yellow
Polyethylene Plastic Gas Piping
•Available in various colours with the utility normally using yellow
or orange ones
•When used underground a minimum 16-gauge copper wire is
taped along the piping for tracing purposes using a metal pipe
detector of radio signals

Underground Tubing
Underground natural gas utility piping is generally either steel or polyethylene
plastic. However, copper tubing is also approved for underground use. So,
while it may not be common, there will be areas of the country where you will
encounter underground natural gas utility tubing.
Underground gas tubing installed downstream of the natural gas meter or
vapour withdrawal valve of a propane container must meet CSA B149.1
requirements:
Type K Copper Tubing
The use of Type K copper tubing underground without any coating is
permissible.
Types L and G Copper Tubing
Underground use requires a manufacturer-installed polyethylene or
PVC coating for Types L and G copper tubing.

Upstream Requirements
CAN/CSA-Z662 Standards
The requirements of CAN/CSA-Z662, Oil and gas pipeline systems, govern upstream of the meter, gas utilities.
Different Requirements
This may involve requirements that are somewhat different from those to which you are accustomed as a gas technician/fitter.
Pipeline Systems
These pipeline systems are used in the servicing and transmission of gas to the meter of the end-user.

Important Safety Notice
Whenever you are dealing with underground utility piping, you must
contact the utility in the area for proper locations and identification.

Non-Utility Piping and
Tubing
Most, but not all, non-utility gas piping and tubing operate aboveground.
The piping downstream of a gas utility meter is usually the responsibility
of the property or building owner. In most instances, the piping runs from
the meter into the building and remains in the building.

Corrugated Stainless Steel Tubing (CSST)
Corrugated stainless steel tubing (CSST) is a promising
alternative to traditional threaded black-iron gas piping for
residential, and industrial applications. Because it is
lightweight, flexible, and needs fewer connections and
fittings, it can be easier to install than traditional threaded
black-iron piping. These benefits can add up to substantial
labour savings for installers and cost savings for builders.
CSST consists of a continuous, flexible, stainless steel pipe
with an exterior PVC yellow covering. The piping is
produced in coils that are air-tested for leaks. You can most
often find it in a central manifold configuration (also called
parallel configuration), with "home run" lines that extend to
gas appliances. Flexible gas piping is lightweight and
requires fewer connections than traditional gas piping
because it is easily bendable and routable around obstacles.

CSST Installation Requirements
No Direct Meter Connection
Direct connection to a meter is not permissible for CSST, same with copper
tube.
Secure Building Piping
Before you can use CSST or copper, you must first secure all building piping.
Manifold System Benefits
The multiport manifold allows for easy future expansion of the system for
room additions or additional appliances.
Cost Savings
The manifold system also saves money using smaller individual pipe sizes and
less fittings (no need for tee take offs), compared to the longest measured
run method.

CSST Safety Benefits
Enhanced System Safety
Fewer behind-wall connections
Reduced Worker Injuries
Lighter equipment needed
Easier Installation
Flexible and bendable
CSST has the potential for higher levels of system safety because connections and joints behind the wall, common in black iron
pipe, are essentially eliminated. In addition, builders and installers have noted a reduction in employee injuries by eliminating
the heavy equipment and apparatus associated with traditional black iron pipe installations.

Underground Non-Utility Gas Piping
There are situations where gas piping operates underground downstream of the gas meter, for example:
Multi-Building Complexes
Complexes that have more than one building requiring gas but
the gas is distributed from one central meter.
Detached Buildings
Single family dwellings with a detached building for a pool
heater or other gas appliance.

Identification and Tracing
Whether you are dealing with utility or non-utility piping or tubing, it is not always clear or easy to identify at particular
locations underground which are gas lines and which are not.
Know Pipe Types
Underground gas piping downstream of
the gas meter is one of these three
types: polyethylene coated steel pipe,
polyethylene plastic pipe, or copper
tubing (either coated or non-coated).
Consider Limitations
Knowing this will help you identify
underground piping but will not always
ensure correct identification. Water
lines are also installed underground
using copper and plastic.
Use Multiple Indicators
Identification of above-ground piping is
easier but not always obvious. Use type
of pipe, its colour coding, and marking;
blueprints; and tracing.

Type of Pipe, Colour Coding,
and Marking
There are separate criteria for identification of underground and above-
ground gas piping and tubing.

Above-Ground Piping Identification Requirements
The identification of gas piping inside some types of buildings and the identification of gas tubing in all types of buildings is required by Clauses

## 6.17 .1 and 6.17.3 of CSA B149.1 as noted below:

Clause 6.17.1
At every care or detention occupancy, commercial, industrial and
assembly building, piping or tubing shall be identified by one of the
following:
•the entire piping or tubing system shall be painted yellow,
•the piping or tubing system shall be provided with yellow
banding that has a minimum width of 1 in (25 mm); or
•the piping or tubing system shall be labelled or marked "GAS"
or "PROPANE" as applicable, utilizing yellow labels or markings.
When identified in accordance with item (b) or (c), the
identification intervals shall not exceed 20 ft (6 m).
Clause 6.17.3
Tubing systems for residential buildings shall be identified in
accordance with Clause 6.17.1, except that identification intervals
shall not exceed 6 ft (2 m) along their entire length.

Additional Identification
Requirements
The above identification requirements have been in editions of CSA B149.1 for decades.
The following additional requirements were added in the 2015 supplements and appear
in the current Code:
Clause 6.17.2
At every care or detention
occupancy, commercial, industrial,
and assembly building, where the
piping or tubing pressure is in
excess of 14 in w.c. (3.5 kPa), both
the piping or tubing and the
pressure shall be identified at the
following locations:
Shut-off Valves
Identification required at all shut-
off valve locations
Penetrations
Identification required at wall, ceiling and floor penetrations

Other Above-Ground Piping Identification
Other above-ground piping, such as water piping, drainage
piping, sprinkler lines etc. may or may not be identified by
marking or colour-coding.
Sometimes water lines and heating pipes are insulated to
maintain temperature or to eliminate condensation. The
insulation may be colour-coded and have the tubing marked
for identification and to show direction of flow.

Blueprint Identification
Piping in commercial and industrial establishments is
generally installed according to the blueprints provided, and
mechanical and plumbing drawings will show all the various
piping arrangements. These drawings along with the
specifications will indicate the types, sizes and location of
installed piping.
Whenever you use blueprints to locate and identify piping,
use the final drawings. These are what you call "as built"
drawings, meaning that the piping arrangement on the
original blueprint may already have changes and the
drawing may have revisions to show any changes. The

Piping Layout, Drawings,
and Symbols
Before installing any equipment, the gas technician/fitter must have a
plan that considers such aspects as how, what, where, and when. This
plan can be very simple, such as one suitable for setting up a small gas
barbecue, or very complex, for heating a large office building. In many
cases, blueprints and specifications will contain the basic plan. Having
such documents and knowing how to read and apply them will ensure
that the piping layout and installation goes ahead with a minimum of
problems.

Blueprints and Specifications
Overview
Installation Planning
The installation of gas piping is a
regular part of the gas
technician's/fitter's duties. How
and where the piping is installed
depends on the type of building,
the type of piping and piping
equipment, and the location of the
piping.
Blueprint Function
Blueprints provide visual guidance
for installation locations,
equipment placement, and
coordination with other building
systems.
Specification Purpose
Specifications provide detailed written instructions that complement the
visual information in blueprints and often take precedence in case of
discrepancies.

Working with Blueprints
Small Buildings
On small buildings or installations found in single family dwellings the gas technician/fitter can work from a blueprint or set of
house plans. These would not normally show water or gas piping. However, these would show the location of fixtures and
equipment (such as water heaters and furnaces) for water or gas, then the installation of the piping would take place at the
discretion of the gas technician/fitter.
Isometric Drawings
Many gas technicians/fitters make an isometric drawing of the planned installation that they can use as a takeoff sheet for
estimating and ordering materials. This could include a drawing that they can submit for approval to the local authority if required.
Larger Installations
On larger installations the gas technician/fitter works from a complete set of blueprints. This set includes architectural, structural,
electrical, and mechanical drawings, and so on, as required. You can find the gas piping and equipment on mechanical drawings,
and locate and identify it on the plan drawing. There may also be detailed and isometric drawings of the layout of specific
equipment and components.

Installation Considerations
Coordination with Other
Trades
As a gas technician/fitter, you
must be aware that you are only
one of many trades involved in
the building process. Before
installing any piping, check other
piping or equipment located in
the same area, such as plumbing,
ductwork, light fixtures, etc.
Piping Locations
You may find or place piping in
ceilings, crawl spaces, pipe
chases, rooftops, floors,
underground or in open areas.
Wherever the location, the
piping must meet Code
requirements as well as
requirements of the building
itself.
Appliance Considerations
The appliance type and venting
system will always dictate where
the gas technician/fitter can
install an appliance. A gas supply
piping system is and should be
the last deciding factor of an
appliance's location.

Typical Piping Diagram
Figure 4-1 shows a typical piping diagram for a building containing two
gas appliances. This type of diagram provides the gas technician/fitter
with a clear visual representation of how the gas piping should be routed
throughout the building to supply the required appliances.
The diagram illustrates the main gas supply line, branch lines to each
appliance, and the appropriate valves and fittings required for a safe and
code-compliant installation. By following such diagrams, technicians can
ensure proper sizing, routing, and installation of all gas piping
components.

Understanding Specifications
Smaller Jobs
On smaller jobs, the specifications or "Specs" may consist
simply of a list of materials written on the same page as the
blueprint.
These simplified specifications still provide essential
information about the materials to be used and basic
installation requirements.
Large Projects
On large projects, specifications are printed in book or
manual form. Often spanning several hundred pages, they
cover every aspect of the job from the initial bidding process
to the final payment.
These comprehensive documents ensure that all
contractors and subcontractors have detailed information
about materials, methods, and quality standards required
for the project.

Precedence of Specifications
Contract Hierarchy
The specification is an integral part of the contract documents and is generally considered to be the
most important document after the actual written agreement.
Resolving Discrepancies
If there is any disagreement between the specification and a drawing, you
usually take the information in the specification to be correct. The reason for
this is that, since the preparation of specifications usually comes last, they
reflect final decisions.
Reporting Issues
If you find a discrepancy, you must report it to the architect
and confirm the correct information in writing.

Code Compliance
Code Priority
You must follow all codes,
regulations, and manufacturers'
certified instructions. Where the
specifications and codes or certified
instructions conflict, the codes and
certified instructions must prevail.
Variances
You can also apply a variance and/or
field approval before the installation
of an appliance.
Installer Responsibility
As a gas fitter, it is your responsibility
to make the owner aware of any
conflicting installation instructions
before completing any additional
work.

Interpreting Instructions and
Symbols
Blueprints and specifications provide the gas technician/fitter with
instructions for the installation of gas piping and equipment. To read and
interpret the drawings, you must be aware of how the various pipelines
are identified on the drawings, as well as the symbols for related fittings
and valves.
Figure 4-2 is an example of how figures show line identification and
fitting symbols. These standardized symbols allow for clear
communication of complex piping systems in a visual format that can be
universally understood by professionals in the field.

Understanding Symbols
International
Standards
Symbols are the
shorthand signs used
on drawings. Most are
recognizable
internationally, but
some countries still
have different
symbols.
Accredited

Figure 4-4 is a plan drawing of a recommended valve train for a low-
pressure burner with an input of over 400,000 Btu/h to 10,000,000
Btu/h. Each component is identified by a symbol.
Understanding these symbols is essential for gas technicians/fitters to
properly interpret drawings and ensure correct installation of valve
trains. The symbols represent various components such as manual
valves, pressure regulators, safety shut-off valves, and other critical
elements of the gas supply system.

Piping Line Symbols
Plans for piping installations also contain special lines to distinguish the various types of pipes. Figure 4-6 shows an
orthographic view of some common piping line symbols and what they represent.
These line symbols help differentiate between different types of piping systems, such as gas lines, water lines, and steam lines.
They also indicate whether pipes are visible, concealed, or underground, providing important installation information for the
gas technician/fitter.

Manufacturer's Installation Data
Certified Documentation
Manufacturers provide certified
installation and service manuals with
their appliances
Content Variation

company to company and from
product to product, the manual will
include all necessary information for
the installation and basic

Service Bulletins
Manufacturers are always providing
updates with service bulletins that
you must follow
Technician Responsibility
Never trust your previous work
experience alone - always read
instructions fully before starting your
work

Model Number Importance
Series Documentation
Manufacturers often publish one set of instructions for
many different models of the same series of appliances.
This means that technicians must carefully identify the
exact model they are working with to ensure they follow the
correct installation specifications.
Example: Vent Specifications
Table 4-1 shows a typical example of the different vent and
combustion pipe details for six different models of the same
appliance.
These specifications can vary significantly between models,
with differences in pipe diameter, length requirements, and
terminal types that are critical for proper installation and
safe operation.

Tools and Hardware Requirements
Manufacturer Specifications
Manufacturers often indicate the
tools and hardware required for the
installation, as the following excerpts
show: "Level each Unit by adjusting
levelling bolts or legs. Use a spirit
level and level Unit four ways. Use a
Robertshaw test instrument with
special disc type thermocouple, or
reliable 'surface' type thermometer."
Supplied Hardware
Manufacturers may also indicate
when hardware is supplied, for
example: "Secure in place with two
hex nuts supplied."
Specialized Equipment
Some installations require specialized tools that may not be part of a standard tool
kit, making it essential to review requirements before beginning work.

Wiring and Piping Diagrams
Comprehensive Documentation
Most manuals come with wiring and piping diagrams which often
come with schedules and keys.
These diagrams provide essential information for proper
electrical connections and gas piping configurations, ensuring
safe and efficient operation of the appliance.

Certification
Requirements
All replacement parts must
meet the same certification
standards as the original
components to maintain the
safety and compliance of the
gas system.
Documentation
Keeping records of all replacement parts used is an important practice
for future maintenance and troubleshooting.

Introduction to Valves
Purpose
While gas piping is for supplying gas to gas-fired equipment, valves are for
controlling the gas flow
Types
Many types of valves used on gas systems, some operated manually,
some automatically, and some both
Certification
All valves used on natural gas and propane systems must
have certification for use on these systems

Manual Valves
1/4-Turn Valves
A typical manual valve you can find on gas systems is a 1/4-
turn valve that will open or close with a quarter-turn of the
handle. This ensures that the valve can open or close rapidly.
Typical locations for manual valves are at the utility gas
meter and the drop to the gas appliance. On large-input
valve trains, the most downstream valve is also a manual
valve, identified as the firing valve.
Handle Types
Some manual valves (the Code requires the firing valve to be
one) have a handle attached. Others, like the valves found at
the gas meter, do not have an attached handle.
Figure 4-7 shows a handled ball-type valve approved for
both indoor and outdoor use.

Gate Valves
Design and Function
As the name implies, a gate valve has a gate that moves up or down
to open or close the valve (see Figure 4-8).
Operation Limitations
Because of excessive vibration and wear created in partially
closed gates, the function of these valves is not for throttling or
flow regulation, but to operate fully open or fully closed.
Application Restrictions
They are typically used on water and steam installations, but
never on gas systems.

Globe Valves
Design Advantages
Unlike gate valves, globe valves work in applications with frequent
operation of flow.
Durability
The design of the globe valve keeps seat erosion to a minimum
(see Figure 4-9).
Application Restrictions
They are generally used in steam or water applications, but
never on gas systems.

Jointing Methods for Manual
Valves
SizeDescription
Larger valvesUsually flanged in place
Mid-range sizesThreaded

Automatic Valves
Primary Functions
Automatic valves typically
control the supply of gas to
the burner. Most are
electrically operated to
control the firing of the
burner (on/off modulation).
Safety Shut-Off
Valves (SSOV)
These valves act as safety
shut-off valves (SSOV),
which open on a call for heat
and close when the call has
ended or when an unsafe
condition (such as flame
failure) is sensed.
Solenoid Valve Operation
The solenoid gas valve function is to open or energize when the
controller calls for the burner to "ignite" and close or de-energize
when the heat demand has been satisfied.

Manual/Automatic Valves
Dual Operation
An example of a valve that operates
both manually and automatically is
the latch valve in Figure 4-11
Manual Opening
This type of valve opens manually but
only when specific conditions such as
proof of air flow are met
Automatic Closing
When the condition is lost the valve
automatically closes
Reset Procedure
You cannot re-engage the valve
handle with the internal components
until you correct the condition
causing the open switch in the
control circuit

Sizing High-Pressure Piping
and Tubing
This presentation covers the essential procedures and considerations for
sizing high-pressure gas piping systems. Understanding these principles
ensures that gas equipment operates according to design specifications
by receiving the correct amount of gas through properly sized pipes.
MK

Purpose of Proper Pipe
Sizing
Ensure Correct Gas
Flow
Gas equipment must
receive the correct amount
of gas to operate according
to design specifications.
Pipe Size as a Critical
Factor
One of the main factors
governing gas flow is pipe
size, which must be
determined correctly.
Methodical Approach Required
An organized and methodical approach to sizing always results in
the correct size measurement.

pressure gas systems.

Key Terminology
TermAbbreviation (symbol)Definition
Code zoneCZHorizontal grouping of flow
values according to the longest
measured run.
Equivalent lengthELFor bends, fittings and valves, the
comparable length of pipe need
to determine the length of
equivalent run (LER). To
determine, use the appropriate
capacity Tables in CSA B149.1.
Length of equivalent runLERMeasured length of pipe added
to the equivalent length of pipe.
Measured lengthMLLength used in determining the
size of any section of gas piping
or tubing. The rows of the
capacity Tables in CSA B149.1
show the measured lengths in
imperial and metric
measurements.

Use of Tables in Gas Pipe Sizing
Consider Influencing Factors
Before sizing gas piping systems, you must consider factors that
influence gas flow.
Understand Pressure Drop
Maximum pressure drop varies in different piping systems and
must be accounted for.
Recognize Different Measurements
Different measurements apply for steel, plastic, copper tubing, and
CSST (follow manufacturer's instructions).
Account for Gas Type
Differences between natural gas and propane require different
sizing approaches.

Code Zones in Sizing Tables
Definition of Code Zones
Each table has a number of rows called Code zones. These
zones correspond to the different lengths of the piping
systems.
The gas pipe sizing tables in the Code have undergone
calculation to give the thousands of British Thermal Units
(Btu/h)/Kilowatts (KW) per hour that will pass through the
different sizes of pipe.
Pressure Loss Allowances
The tables record the exact pressure loss allowed according
to the pressure and length of the system:
•Calculations for low-pressure and 2 psi gas systems
include a 20% allowance for a reasonable number of
fittings.
•Sizing higher pressure systems must include proof that
the measured length of the system plus the equivalent
length of the fittings do not exceed the Code zone length
upon which you size the piping system.

Factors Affecting Gas Flow
Pipe Diameter
The amount of gas that flows
through a pipe increases as the pipe
diameter increases
Pipe Length
The amount of gas that flows through
a pipe increases as the length of the
pipe decreases
Gas Density
The amount of gas that flows through
a pipe increases as the density of the
gas decreases

Pressure Drop in Gas Systems
Supply Pressures
The supply of gas usually occurs at distinct pressures:
•7 in w.c.
•2 psi
•5 psi
•10 psi
•20 psi
Maximum Pressure Drop
The maximum pressure drop across the length of a piping
system is a distinct amount for each system pressure.
The pipe sizing tables in Annexes A and B of CSA B149.1
include separate tables for each system pressure.
Annex in CSA B149.1Sizing for
Annex ANatural gas systems
Annex BPropane systems

Copper Tubing
Considerations
Different Tables
Required
Since the inside diameters
and inside surface textures
of tubing are different from
those of pipe, there is a
completely separate set of
tables in CSA B149.1 for
sizing copper tube.
Outside Diameter
Measurement
The tables in the Code list
tubing sizes in outside
diameters. Some tubing
that you can find in the field
is identified by nominal size
(inside diameters).
Important Note
Be sure that you use the outside diameter when referring to the
tables.

Natural Gas vs. Propane Gas
Separate Sizing Tables
The set of tables for natural gas (in Annex A) is completely
different from the set for propane (in Annex B).
The reasons for having separate sizing tables for natural gas
and propane fuels are because of the differing properties as
gases.
Key Differences
•Different specific gravities of the two fuels cause varying
flow patterns through piping.
•Slightly different operating pressures.
•Differing heat values. This constitutes the main reason
propane and natural gas require separate sizing tables.
Propane carries 2.5 times the amount of heat in
comparable quantities.

Implications of Gas Type
Differences
Pipe Sizing Differences
Propane requires smaller piping
or tubing diameters in order to
carry the same amount of heat
value to an appliance compared
to natural gas.
Appliance
Considerations
An appliance with the same
Btu/h input rating requires
smaller diameter supply piping
and have smaller diameter
orifice openings when using
propane fuel.
Heat Value Impact
Since propane carries 2.5 times the amount of heat in comparable
quantities, this significantly affects all sizing calculations.

General Sizing Procedure
Refer to Annex E of CSA B149.1 for an example of pipe sizing and design.
It is important to be familiar with the general procedure for pipe sizing
before you address specific high-pressure sizing procedures which are
described in the High-pressure sizing procedure section.
Be consistent in following the procedural steps described in this section.

Step 1: Sketch the System
1
Create Detailed Sketch
When you sketch the system, determine the length of the pipe
sections and label them.
2
Identify System Regulators
Check for system regulators and do a separate sizing procedure
for the piping downstream of each regulator.

Step 2: Select a Table
Identify Gas Type
Identify the type of gas - the density determines the use of
natural gas or propane tables.
Identify Piping Material
Identify piping material - iron pipe or copper tubing. Note
whether iron pipe will be screwed or welded.
Identify Gas Pressure
Identify the gas pressure and the corresponding pressure
drop. Consider factors like available gas pressure from the
utility, job specifications, Code requirements, and cost.

Step 3: Determine Code Zone
For Low-Pressure and 2 psi Systems
Determine the appropriate Code zone by adding the section
lengths from your sketch to find the longest measured run
(LMR).
For Pressures Over 2 psi
Determine the appropriate Code zone by basing your
estimate on the measured run lengths, and on the
equivalent lengths of straight pipe for fittings in the runs
added together.

Step 4: Size Pipe Sections
1
Create Section List
Make a list of the pipe sections.
2
Document Details
Include labels, thousands of Btu/h and the pipe size for each
section.

Step 5: Prove Code Zone is Correct
For Pressure Over 2 psi Only
You must prove that the length of the
equivalent run (LER) is smaller than the Code
zone used to size the pipe.
The LER for an appliance is the total measured
length of the piping run to that appliance, plus
the equivalent lengths of all fittings (Table A.16
and B.12) in that run.
If LER is Larger Than Code Zone
You must increase the Code zone length you
have estimated and continue until the Code
zone is long enough.
If Code Zone Estimate is Too Long
Prove that a shorter Code zone guess would be
too short, unless this is obvious.

Step 6: Consult Code Table
Find Code Zone
When you have estimated your Code zone length, go to
the relevant Code table and under the left-hand vertical
column find the Code zone according to your estimate.
Find Capacity
Read across the table to the right to find the highest
capacity that is closest to your calculation.
Determine Pipe Size
Then read straight up to the top of the table to ascertain
the appropriate pipe size.

Important Notes on Fittings
Equivalent Lengths of
Tees
Equivalent lengths of tees are
counted only if the flow to the
appliance in question changes
direction at the tee.
Tee Sizing
The size of a tee is that of its
largest opening.
Documentation
A typical completed worksheet
for carrying out pipe sizing is
shown in Figure 5-3. The
Appendix contains a blank
worksheet.

Sample Code Table for
Sizing Large Pipe
Figure 5-1 shows a sample CSA B149.1 Code table for sizing large pipe.
The table displays maximum capacity in thousands of Btu/h for schedule
40 pipe, for pressures of 5 psig based on a pressure drop of 2.5 psig.
The table organizes pipe sizes (NPS) from 1/2 to 2-1/2 across the top,
with length of pipe in feet down the left side ranging from 10 feet to 600
feet.
The Code zone is determined by finding the appropriate row based on
the length of the equivalent run.

Proof of Procedure
List Valves and Fittings
List valves and all fittings that change the direction of flow.
Look Up Equivalent Lengths
Look up their equivalent lengths from either Table A.16 or B.12 of
CSA B149.1.
Total Fitting Equivalent Lengths
Total the fitting equivalent lengths.
Calculate Length of Equivalent Run
To this total, add the length of the measured run to the
appliance. The resulting sum is the LER of the appliance.

Sample Pipe Sizing
Worksheet
Figure 5-3 shows a sample pipe sizing and proving worksheet for a
natural gas system using iron pipe with threaded fittings at 5 PSIG with
an allowable pressure drop of 2.5 PSIG.
The worksheet includes columns for line number, load in MBtu/h,
estimated pipe size, confirmed pipe size, maximum allowable load, and
detailed fitting calculations including size/type, number of fittings, and
equivalent lengths.
The proof section shows measured length, estimated code zone, fitting
allowance, length of equivalent run (LER), and confirmation of the code
zone.

High-Pressure Sizing Procedure
Definition of High-Pressure
Normally, CSA B149.1 considers any gas above 0.5 psig to be
high-pressure. However, the pipe sizing tables are based on
the formulas that are included in the Code.
These formulas are of two sets:
•For pressures up to 1.5 psig
•For pressures 1.5 psig and higher
Table Derivation
The tables in the Code are derived from these formulas.
The procedure for sizing a high-pressure piping system is
very similar to the general procedures, with some specific
differences in steps 8 through 10.

This is a check to see whether you
chose the correct Code zone. This
step is very important because
having estimated the Code zone,
you must check whether that pipe
size will actually carry the gas load.
Verification Method
You do this by checking whether
the measured length added to the
equivalent length exceeds the
Code zone length.

Code Zone Considerations
Oversizing Concerns
If your estimated code zone, i.e., 125 ft, is above the actual
length, i.e., 100 ft, (measured plus equivalent for fittings),
the system will work fine, but oversizing will increase job
cost.
Multiple Pressure Zones
A piping system may contain more than one pressure zone.
You must repeat the same procedure for each zone, starting
from the pressure regulator that applies to each zone.
Tip: Size the lower pressure zones first! The pipe sizes will be
the same if you size the high pressure first. Use personal
preference but be consistent.

Example 1: Preliminary Analysis
Code Zone (CZ) Selection
Choose a Code zone equal to, or longer than, the equivalent
length of all pipe runs in the system. At this point, you do not
know the size of the fittings, so you must estimate their
equivalent length.
If you refer to Table A.5 a) in CSA B149.1, you can see that
the choice of zones is limited to 150 ft, 175 ft, and 200 ft.
Making an allowance for a reasonable number of fittings,
you would determine that the 175 ft Code zone is the best
choice. (This allows an extra 30 ft of pipe as an allowance for
the fittings.)

List all fittings on the run, starting with the longest measured run.
Look Up Equivalent Lengths
Look up their equivalent lengths from Table A.16 in the Code.
Calculate Total Equivalent Length
Add up all the equivalent lengths for fittings and the

Equivalent length (EL)17.22 ft
Measured length (ML)140.00 ft
Length of equivalent run (LER)157.22 ft

Example 1: Verification
Pipe A Verification

Selected Code Zone = 175 ft

## 164.28 ft < 175 ft ✓

Pipe B Verification
LER = 157.22 ft
Selected Code Zone = 175 ft

## 157.22 ft < 175 ft ✓

Conclusion
If both pipe A's and pipe B's length of equivalent runs are less than
the selected Code zone, the Code zone is within limits. In neither
case does the LER exceed the selected Code zone of 175 ft.
Therefore, the 175 ft Code zone is okay and size of the pipe is correct.

## 53.89 m < 60 m ✓

Pipe B Verification

Conclusion
If the length of equivalent runs of both
pipe A and pipe B is less than the
selected Code zone, the Code zone is
within limits. In neither case does the
LER exceed the selected Code zone of
60 m. Therefore, the 60 m Code zone is
okay and the size of the pipe is correct.

Propane Example 3

Note that Example 3 has two pressure zones identified. We use the
normal low-pressure procedure for sizing the low-pressure zone, and
then use the high-pressure procedure shown in Examples 1 and 2. As
there are no fittings that change direction in Example 3, there is no need
for the preliminary analysis and proof of procedure shown in the previous
examples.

Factors Affecting Pipe Size Selection
Cost Considerations
Balancing proper sizing with economic constraints
Code Requirements
Following mandatory regulations and standards
Job Specifications
Meeting project-specific requirements
Available Gas Pressure
Working within utility-supplied pressure constraints

Common Mistakes in Pipe Sizing
Incorrect Code Zone Selection
Choosing a Code zone that doesn't account for the full length of equivalent run
can result in undersized piping.
Overlooking Fittings
Failing to account for the equivalent length of fittings, especially in high-
pressure systems where this is critical.
Using Wrong Tables
Using natural gas tables for propane systems or vice versa, or using the wrong
pressure tables.
Measurement Confusion
Mixing up inside and outside diameters for tubing, or confusing imperial and
metric measurements.

Best Practices for Pipe Sizing
Be Methodical
Follow a consistent, step-by-step approach to sizing every time.
Document Everything
Keep detailed records of all calculations, including pipe loads,
measured lengths, and equivalent lengths.
Verify Your Work
Always double-check calculations and prove that your Code
zone selection is appropriate.
Consider Future Needs
When appropriate, allow for potential system expansion
without excessive oversizing.

Importance of Proper Pipe Sizing
Consequences of Undersizing
•Insufficient gas flow to appliances
•Poor equipment performance
•Potential safety hazards
•Increased maintenance issues
•Customer dissatisfaction
Consequences of Oversizing
•Unnecessary material costs
•Increased labor for installation
•Potential space constraints
•Higher project expenses
•Reduced cost-effectiveness

Sizing for Different Gas Types
Natural Gas Considerations
Natural gas has a lower heat value per volume compared to
propane, requiring larger diameter piping to deliver the
same amount of energy.
Natural gas is lighter than air (specific gravity approximately

## 0.6 ), affecting flow characteristics through piping.

Typically supplied at standardized pressures from utility
companies.
Propane Considerations
Propane carries 2.5 times the heat value of natural gas in
comparable quantities, allowing for smaller diameter piping.
Propane is heavier than air (specific gravity approximately

## 1.5 ), creating different flow patterns.

Often supplied from on-site storage tanks with pressure
regulators to achieve desired system pressures.

Sizing for Different Piping Materials
Iron Pipe
•Available in schedule 40 and schedule 80
•Can be connected with threaded or welded fittings
•Different sizing tables for threaded vs. welded
connections
•Durable and widely used in commercial applications
•Sized by nominal pipe size (NPS)
Copper Tubing
•Typically used in residential and light commercial
applications
•Different inside diameter and surface texture from iron
pipe
•Requires separate sizing tables in the code
•Listed in tables by outside diameter (OD)
•Sometimes identified in the field by nominal size (inside
diameter)

Sizing for Different Pressure Systems
Low Pressure (< 0.5 psig)
Typically 7 inches water column for natural gas
Medium Pressure (0.5 - 5 psig)
Common in commercial and industrial applications
High Pressure (> 5 psig)
Used for long runs and high-demand systems
Each pressure range requires different sizing tables and has different allowable pressure drops. Higher pressure systems can
use smaller diameter piping for the same gas load but require more rigorous verification of equivalent lengths.

Multi-Stage Pressure Systems
High Pressure Zone
Smaller diameter piping for long runs
Pressure Regulator
Reduces pressure to next stage
Medium Pressure Zone
Intermediate distribution
Pressure Regulator
Reduces to appliance pressure
Low Pressure Zone
Final distribution to appliances

Equivalent Length Calculations
Purpose of Equivalent Length
Fittings and valves create resistance to gas flow similar to
straight pipe. The equivalent length concept allows us to
convert this resistance into an equivalent length of straight
pipe for sizing purposes.
Calculation Process
For each fitting or valve:
1.Identify the type and size of fitting
2.Look up the equivalent length in Table A.16 (natural gas)
or B.12 (propane)
3.Add up all equivalent lengths
4.Add this total to the measured length of pipe
5.The result is the Length of Equivalent Run (LER)

Tee Fitting Considerations
Direction of Flow
Equivalent lengths of tees are counted only if the flow to the
appliance in question changes direction at the tee.
Sizing Rule
The size of a tee is that of its largest opening.
Flow Patterns
Gas flowing straight through a tee experiences less resistance than
gas changing direction through the branch.
Resistance Factors
The equivalent length accounts for the additional resistance created
when gas changes direction.

Worksheet Documentation
Worksheet Components
•System information (gas type, pipe type, pressure)
•Line numbers and loads
•Estimated and confirmed pipe sizes

Locate the row corresponding to your estimated Code zone
length.
Read Across for Capacity
Move horizontally to find the capacity value closest to but not
less than your required load.
Read Up for Pipe Size
From that capacity value, move vertically to the top of the
table to find the required pipe size.

Practical Application Tips
Start with a
Clear Sketch
A detailed, labeled
sketch of the system
is essential for
accurate sizing.
Be Conservative
in Estimates
When estimating
Code zones, it's
better to slightly
overestimate than
underestimate.
Always Verify
Never skip the
verification step to
prove your Code
zone selection is
appropriate.
Document
Everything
Keep detailed
records of all
calculations and
decisions for future
reference.

Sizing for System Modifications
Adding Appliances
When adding new appliances to an existing system:
1.Calculate the total new load
2.Verify existing pipe sizes can handle the increased load
3.Size new branch lines appropriately
4.Consider pressure drop across the entire system
5.Document all changes and calculations
Extending Systems
When extending an existing system:
1.Determine the new longest measured run
2.Recalculate the appropriate Code zone
3.Verify existing pipe sizes remain adequate
4.Size new sections based on the updated calculations
5.Consider using a higher pressure zone with regulators for
long extensions

Purging Operations on
Large Piping Systems
The methods for purging large diameter piping are somewhat different
from those for purging small diameter piping. This is due to the large air
gas volumes involved, as well as the greater chance of pipe wall rupture if
there is an ignition and explosion. The gas technician/fitter must be
aware that the use of inert gases to purge large lines removes the
possibility of accidental ignition and explosion.

To safely introduce fuel gas into a pipeline
Safe Removal of Fuel Gas
To safely remove fuel gas from a pipeline for the purposes of
abandonment and repair

Code Concerns for Purging
Purging After Leak Testing
Concerned with purging of piping
and tubing systems and hose after
leak testing
Gas Mixtures for Specific
Purposes
Refer to gas mixtures to be used
for purging other than for leak
testing: i.e., "for the purpose of
repair, alteration, or
abandonment"

CSA B149.1 Recommendations
Large Diameter Piping
Requirements
If the piping is NPS 4 or
larger, and testing involves
the use of air, you must first
purge it with carbon dioxide,
nitrogen, or a mixture of
these, and then purge it with
gas in accordance with
Clause 6.23.4.
Competent Person
Requirement
The person doing the
purging must be a
competent person and in
direct control of the purging
gas supply during the
purging operation by means
of a valve having an attached
operating handle within 5 ft
of the purge point.
Piping Size
Requirements
The piping for the gas being
purged must either be of a
size or be reduced to a size
not larger than NPS 1/2 for
piping up to NPS 4.
Engineering Practices
If the piping exceeds NPS 4,
purging pipe must follow
engineering practices.

Safety Importance in Purging
Explosion Risk
Mixing air and fuel gas poses a very real risk of a serious explosion
Personal Responsibility
Gas technicians/fitters must follow proper purging procedures
Code Compliance
Code regulations require correct purging to prevent
accidental explosions

Fire and Explosion Risks
Outside Pipe
Combustible Mixture
If you mix natural gas and air
in a ratio that falls between
4% and 15%, you produce a
combustible mixture.
Avoid Confined
Spaces
It is important that you do
not purge into any confined
space, such as a room where
the potential for fire and
explosion exist.
Safe Approach
Generally, the safest approach is to use a purge hose to the
outdoors, with a gas technician/fitter at each end operating
manual valves to ensure that the purge is safely evacuating away
from sources of ignition and air inlets to the building.

Purging Safety Prohibitions
Do Not Purge Through Burner System
Do not purge a new gas line through the burner system into a
combustion chamber.
Do Not Allow Uncontrolled Gas Escape
Do not crack the piping union or drip leg open and allow an
uncontrolled escape of gas.

Special Caution with Propane
Propane Properties
You need to take extreme caution when purging propane
gas, as it is heavier than air and collects in buildings, low
lying areas, and drains.
Ventilation Challenges
This makes the area difficult to ventilate after purging. Use a
gas detector to ensure the ventilation of propane.

Fire and Explosion Risks Inside Pipe
Large Diameter Risk
Explosion inside the pipe is a serious hazard, especially when the diameter of the pipe is 4 in or
greater
Pipe Wall Failure
The pipe walls are not strong enough to contain the pressure increase as the
gas-air mix burns inside
Catastrophic Result
The pipe bursts, causing serious damage

Internal Ignition Sources
Internal Sparks
Sources of ignition exist inside the
pipe
High Velocity
Even with little gas flow, gas moves at
very high velocities
Debris Movement
Iron filings, stones, and other debris
inside the pipe are swept along
Ignition Conditions
Fuel, oxygen, and heat are all present
in an inadequately purged pipe

Categories of Purging
Small Diameter Pipes
Pipes below Nominal Pipe Size 4 (NPS 4)
Review the description of pipes less than NPS 4 in Unit 8
Introduction to piping and tubing systems.
Large Diameter Pipes
Pipes at or above Nominal Pipe Size 4 (NPS 4)
For larger pipes, you can use these two types of purging:
•Two separate purges in succession
•Slug purging

Two Purges in Succession
For larger pipes, introducing fuel gas into a pipe requires two separate
purges in succession, while removing fuel gas from a piping system only
requires the completion of one purge operation.
PurgeDescription
Introduce fuel gas1) Purge air with inert gas on new
installations or after repairs or
alterations.
2) Purge inert gas with fuel gas.
This will prevent the formation of
gas-air mixtures.
Remove fuel gas1) Purge fuel gas with inert gas
before you repair or abandon an
existing large system.

Slug Purging Overview
Definition
For very long, large pipes (such as those installed by the gas
supply company), instead of performing two successive
purges, you might slug-purge to flush out all the contents of
the pipe.
Benefit
Slug purging reduces the amount of inert gas you would
otherwise have to use.

Slug Purging Process
Inject Inert Gas
Inject a mass of inert gas, called a slug, into the pipe
Flush with Fuel Gas
Flush the slug gas with the fuel gas
Complete Purge
The slug acts as a barrier between air and gas

Slug Purging Example
A common example of the use of slug purging is the safe removal of air from a large-diameter piping system.
Rather than completely purging the line with nitrogen, it is more economical to insert a large slug of nitrogen into the piping first and then turn on the fuel gas to
force the nitrogen and air through the purge point. The nitrogen acts as a divider between the air and gas to prevent them from mixing.
Nitrogen Slug Injection
Inserting a large volume of nitrogen as a barrier between air and fuel gas
Fuel Gas Introduction
Fuel gas pushing the nitrogen slug and air through the purge point

Slug Purging Best Practices
Maintain Proper
Velocity
Maintain normal purge
velocity (200 ft/min in large
piping) so that the pipe is
scrubbed as the gas moves
and prevents the gases from
intermingling as they move.
Ensure Adequate
Volume
The slug must have enough
volume to prevent the
formation of fuel gas-air
mixture. The volume of the
slug takes into account the
diameter and length of the
piping system (which you
can see in piping tables).
Consider Slug Length
Since the slug is slowly destroyed over distance and time and
since longer piping systems require longer purge times, you must
be sure that the slug of inert gas is long enough to compensate.

Safety Considerations Summary
Competent Personnel
Only trained technicians should perform
purging operations
Proper Procedures
Follow all code requirements and
engineering practices
Appropriate Equipment
Use the right tools and materials for the
job

procedures create highly dangerous conditions.
Follow Code Requirements
CSA B149.1 contains specific recommendations for large diameter piping. If the
piping exceeds NPS 4, purging pipe must follow engineering practices.
Choose Appropriate Methods
For larger pipes, you can use two separate purges in succession or slug purging
depending on the specific situation and pipe characteristics.
Ensure Competent Personnel
The person doing the purging must be a competent person and in direct control of
the purging gas supply during the purging operation.

Rigging Safety
A good workplace safety philosophy to adopt is one of zero accidents and
zero incidents. Preparing and moving heavy equipment and materials
can result in serious accidents and injury if not properly planned and
executed. Performing rigging work operations safely is one of the
cornerstones of a workplace safety program.
Construction crew trainers typically provide trainees with a Riggers
Handbook or a Rigging Card to reinforce appropriate and safe rigging,
lifting, and hoisting procedures. These handbooks and cards summarize
basic safe rigging practices and provide sling tables and shackle charts.
Hardhat stickers with sling capacities can also provide similar
information.

regulations > Occupational Health and Safety acts and
regulations for a list of the acts and regulations specific to
workplace safety by province and territory.
It's essential for all rigging personnel to be familiar with the
specific regulations that apply to their jurisdiction, as
requirements may vary between provinces and territories.

Fall Protection Requirements
Safety Belts
OH&S establishes
minimum
requirements for the
use of fall protection
devices including belts
for preventing falls
from heights.
Lifelines
Properly installed
lifelines provide a
continuous point of
attachment for
workers at heights.
Lanyards
Lanyards connect the
worker's harness to the
lifeline or anchor point,
limiting fall distance.
Safety Nets
Safety nets can be
installed to catch
workers in case of a fall
when other fall
protection is
impractical.
Local and regional requirements may specify a fall arrest certificate of training prior to using any fall
protection equipment. Check for OH&S requirements in your province or territory.

Planning Rigging Operations
Thorough Planning
Plan any operation involving cranes before execution

Worker Safety
Ensure safety of all personnel involved
Equipment Protection
Prevent damage to equipment and materials
In order to ensure the safety of workers and the equipment involved, thoroughly plan any operation involving the use of a crane to lift items
before you carry them out. This Chapter details requirements for planning and performing an incidental lift using an overhead crane and
commonly available rigging components, such as slings, shackles, eye bolts, and turnbuckles.

Job Site Considerations
Material Handling
Job site considerations include the handling, setting, and
assembly of materials and equipment.
Unique Challenges
Each operation presents its own peculiar problems as no two
jobs are alike.
Proper Planning
With proper planning and execution, you can perform each job
free of bodily harm to the employee and without damage to the
equipment.
Attention to Detail
The person authorized and qualified to do rigging must always
pay close attention to details. One distraction, careless moment,
miscalculation, or action can result in serious injury or death and
possible equipment/property damage.

Rigging Personnel Requirements
Qualified Personnel
You should never perform proper
rigging, which requires following all
current safety
requirements/procedures and using
appropriate type/size of equipment, if
you are inexperienced. If you don't
know how to do it properly, then don't
attempt it.
Challenging Conditions
Usually, persons performing rigging
tasks already have the two following
strikes against them when they start:
•Unfavourable job conditions
•Job schedule to meet
Certification Requirements
The information in this Chapter is for awareness only. Completion of the
information does not certify you as a licensed rigger or crane operator. Refer to
current certification requirements.

Key Definitions in Rigging
TermDefinition
Asymmetrical loadObject with an off-center center of gravity
due to the object's irregular shape and/or
composition.
Critical liftsRequire confirmation of engineering or
merit additional engineering input because
of an item's or location's size, weight,
close-tolerance installation, or high
susceptibility to damage.
Person-in-chargePerson appointed by the responsible
manager or designee to direct critical or
pre-engineered lifts. He/She must be
present during the entire lifting operation.
Pre-engineered liftsRepetitive lifts that meet the definition of a
critical lift. May use tooling, fixtures,
sketches, analyses, and written
procedures.

More Key Definitions
TermDefinition
Safe working load (SWL)The same as the WLL in most cases. The exceptions are where the
conditions of use require a reduction to a lower safe working load.
Examples would be severe environmental conditions such as very low
temperatures, inaccuracy of weight, and likelihood of shock loading.
Symmetrical loadObject that, because of its uniform shape and composition, has its center
of gravity located exactly in its middle.
Working load limit (WLL)Maximum load that an item of lifting equipment is designed to raise,
lower, or suspend.

Classifying Lifts
Lift Assessment
A lift assessment to determine the lift's category must take place before planning a lift
Three Categories
There are normally three lift categories: incidental/ordinary lift, pre-engineered
lift, and critical lift
Manager Determination
The responsible manager or designee determines the type
of lift by conducting a lift assessment

Lift Categories and
Requirements
If the lift is a/anThen
Incidental or ordinary liftThe manager/designee must
select, inspect, and connect
appropriate equipment prior to
the lift.
Pre-engineered liftThe manager/designee must
meet additional criteria prior to
operation.
Critical liftThe manager/designee must use
worksite engineering riggers or
an approved contractor.

Incidental/Ordinary Lift Requirements
Planning and Approval
Following the planning and approval of a
lift, you must select, inspect, and connect
correctly the appropriate rigging
equipment-including slings, spreader
beams, shackles, turnbuckles, and the
crane itself-prior to beginning the lift.
Pre-Lift Checklist
Check and confirm the following items
before selecting rigging components:
•Weight of lift
•Lift points
•Center of gravity
•Crane capacity
•Speed, height, width, and length of
lift
•Wind, temperature, and visibility
Additional Considerations
Also check:
•Crane and load foundation ratings
•Sharp corners and angles on load
•Sling angles
•Load angle factor
•Travel route clearance
•Floor loading capacity
•Work zone safety

Pre-engineered Lift Requirements
Documentation Requirements
You must complete and submit a Pre-engineered Lift Plan
to the Safety Committee before performing any work.
The Lift Plan consists of as many drawings, specifications,
and procedures as necessary to assess all important load
factors and site factors relating to the lift.
Additional Information
For further details, consult the company's Pre-engineered
Lift Procedure.
Pre-engineered lifts are repetitive lifts that meet the
definition of a critical lift. If the Safety Committee
determines that through the use of tooling, fixtures,
sketches, analyses, and written procedures, the possibility
of dropping, upset, or collision is reduced to an acceptable
level, the lift may have designation as a pre-engineered lift.

Calculating Weight of Load -
Step 1
Measure the Object
Measure the object to get dimensions (length, width, and height) to
determine volume.
Calculate Volume
Use the appropriate formula based on the shape of the object:
•Rectangle/square: Volume = length × width × height
•Hollow cylinder: Volume = 3.14 × length × wall thickness × (diameter -
wall thickness)
•Complex shape: Break into smaller parts or use enclosing rectangle
Special Considerations
For concrete reinforcing rod, calculate as a cylinder. For pipe,
calculations require actual measurements of diameter and wall
thickness for accuracy.

Rectangle Three-dimensional Example
Rectangular Volume Calculation
For a rectangular object, the volume is calculated using the
formula:
Volume = length × width × height
This simple formula allows you to determine the volume of
any rectangular or square object by multiplying its three
dimensions together.
The diagram shows a rectangular prism with its three
dimensions clearly labeled. To find the volume, multiply the
length by the width by the height.

Determining Object's Material - Step 2
Material Identification
Look up the weight per unit volume for the material of the object.
Different materials have different densities, which affects the
overall weight of the object. Identifying the correct material is
crucial for accurate weight calculations.
MaterialPounds per cubic foot
(lb/ft³)
Aluminum165
Concrete150
Copper560
Lead710
Paper60
Steel490
Water65
Wood, pine40

Determining Weight of
Object - Step 3
Apply the Formula
Multiply the weight per unit volume by the calculated volume to get
the calculated weight of the object.
Example Calculation
For a concrete block measuring 8 ft × 4 ft × 6 ft:
Volume = 8 ft × 4 ft × 6 ft = 192 ft³
Weight = 192 ft³ × 150 lb/ft³ = 28,800 lbs
Verification
Always verify your calculations and consider adding a safety
factor when planning rigging operations.

Rectangular Shape Calculation
Example
StepDescription
Step 1-Calculate weight of loadDimensions of object: · 8 ft long × 4
ft wide × 6 ft high 4 ft W 6 ft H 8ft L
Volume of a rectangle is its length
times its width times its height: L ×
W × H = V · 8 ft × 4 ft × 6 ft = 192 ft³
Step 2-Determine object's materialConcrete block: · Concrete weighs
150 lbs/ft³ (see Table 7-1).
Step 3-Determine weight of objectThe load will weigh approximately:
· 192 ft³ × 150 lbs/ft³ = 28,800 lbs
(block weight).

Complex Shape Calculation Example
StepDescription
Step 1-Calculate weight of loadDimensions of object: Complex shape 9 ft H 3 ft W 4 ft H 2
ft L 2 ft L Volume of a rectangle is its length times its width
times its height. Cut the object into rectangles, and then
calculate the weight of each section, as shown below: ·
L×W×H=V · Left section Vleft = 2 ft × 3 ft × 4 ft = 24 ft³ · Right
section Vright = 2 ft × 3 ft × 9 ft = 54 ft³ · Total volume
Vtotal= 24 + 54 = 78 ft³
Step 2- Determine object's materialConcrete widget. · Concrete weighs 150 lbs/ft³ (see Table
7-1),
Step 3-Determine weight of objectThe load will weigh approximately: · 78 ft³ × 150 lbs/ft³ =
11,700 lbs (block weight)

Wire Rope Slings
Main Component
One of the main components of any rigging arrangement is the sling or
"choker". Slings come in a number of shapes, sizes, capacities, and types.
Main Types
•Wire rope
•Nylon
•Polyester round
•Chain
•Wire mesh
Wire rope used in rigging is typically 6 × 19 (6 strands and 19 wires per strand)
or 6 × 37 (6 strands and 37 wires per strand) class.
Safe Working Load
All slings (regardless of type) must have a legible tag stating, among other
things, it's safe working load (SWL) when in a straight pull. The SWL does not
account for how to use the sling, whether in a choke or basket hitch or on an
angle.
You could de-rate the sling as much as 30% when it is placed in a choker
configuration, while a true basket hitch (where both legs are vertical) will have
twice the rated capacity.

Wire Rope Sling Pre-use Inspection
Inspection Frequency
Inspect daily before use and frequently during use.
Remove From Service When
•Ten randomly distributed broken wires are in one rope lay, or
five broken wires are in one strand in one rope lay
•More than one broken wire are at an end connection
•Reduction in rope diameter (1/3 or more of the original wire
diameter)
•Severe localized wear, abrasion, or scraping
Additional Removal Conditions
•Kinking, crushing, under-stranding, bird-caging, core
protrusion
•Evidence of heat damage
•End attachments that are cracked, deformed or worn
•Hooks or latches deformed or damaged
•Corrosion of the rope or end attachments
Required Markings
Each wire rope sling must have marking that shows the name or
trademark of manufacturer, the rated load capacity for the types
of hitches and the angle upon which it is based, and its diameter
or size.

Wire Rope Sling Configurations
Single Leg Bridle or Sling
A single leg bridle or sling-the most
common type of sling-has a loop at
each end and optional thimbles,
links, or hooks.
This sling is sometimes referred to
as choker. The term "choker" can be
confusing because you can use the
sling in a vertical hitch, basket hitch,
or choker hitch. You can use other
types of slings in a choker hitch.
Multiple Leg Bridle
The multiple leg bridle consists of
two or more legs attached to a link
for convenient handling and
assembly.
Endless Sling
You may mechanically splice or lay
up endless slings endlessly in a
helical manner to form a loop of six
parts and a core. The latter is also
correctly called a grommet. Use
caution when using an endless sling
in basket hitches because if the
center of gravity of the load is high,
the sling can rend over the hook.
This sling is what you most often
use in a doubled choker or anchor
hitch.

Wire Rope Sling Body Construction
Single-Part Sling
A single-part sling is the most common sling construction. It
consists of a single leg sling made from a length of wire rope
or a grommet sling made from a continuous length of strand
to form an endless rope.
This is:
•The stiffest type of sling construction
•The most abrasion resistant
This construction, in form of a grommet, is what you call
strand-laid.
Multi-Part Cable-Laid Sling
A cable-laid sling is composed of six individual wire ropes
laid helically around a wire rope core. It is much more flexible
and less abrasion resistant than the single-part sling.
Grommet slings are available in this configuration.
Braided Sling
A braided sling may be machine- or hand-braided using
four, six, or eight parts of wire rope.
This is the most flexible and most expensive construction.

Sling Angle Factor
Definition and Usage
The sling angle factor is a multiplier used to determine the
required sling size when angle formed between sling and
load is less than 90°:
•Estimate angle to nearest 5°
•Avoid rigging loads where angle is less than 45°
As the angle between the sling and the horizontal decreases,
the force on each sling increases, requiring a stronger sling
to safely lift the same load.
The diagram illustrates how the sling angle affects the load
on each sling. As the angle decreases, the load factor
increases, putting more stress on the rigging equipment.

D/d Ratio in Wire Rope Slings
Definition
When a basket hitch uses a wire rope sling, the diameter of
the load where the sling contacts the load can reduce sling
capacity. The method for determining the loss of strength or
efficiency is what you refer to as the D/d Ratio, where:
•"D" refers to the diameter of the object being lifted
•"d" refers to the diameter of the wire rope sling
Example
For example, when you use a 1 in wire rope sling to lift an
object with a 25 in diameter, the D/d Ratio is 25-to-1 (25/1).
Alternatively, the "D" can refer to the cross-sectional
diameter of the eye, hook, or other object being used to
hoist the load. In both cases, the effective strength of the
sling results.
A smaller D/d ratio can significantly reduce the strength of
the sling due to the sharp bend in the wire rope.

Synthetic Slings
Advantages
Because of their relative softness, width, and flexibility, synthetic webbing slings
have fewer tendencies to mar or scratch finely machined, highly polished or
painted surfaces and crush fragile objects.
Adaptability
Synthetic slings tend to mould themselves to the shape of the load.
Material Benefits
•Do not rust
•Do not stain ornamental precast concrete or stone
•Are non-sparking
•Can be used safely in explosive atmospheres
Usage Warning
Do not use web slings at an angle placing more load on one edge than the other.

Synthetic Web Sling Inspection
Inspection Frequency
Inspect slings daily before use and frequently during use.
Remove From Service When
•Knots, snags, holes, tears, or cuts
•Extensive abrasive wear
•Melting or charring of any part of the sling surface
•Visible red yarns or threads indicating excessive wear
•Broken or worn stitches
Additional Removal Conditions
•Chemical damage including acid or caustic burns, brittle or stiff areas, and
discoloration
•Corrosive discoloration or other damage to fittings
•Missing, illegible, or incomplete sling identification
Identification Requirements
Synthetic web slings must have tag(s) marked with specific information on the
manufacturer and sling usage.

Endless and Eye-and-Eye Synthetic Web Sling
Inspection
Inspection Frequency
Inspect slings daily before use
and frequently during use.
Chemical Damage
Remove slings from service when
chemical damage including acid
or caustic burns, brittle or stiff
areas, and discoloration of any
kind is present.
Heat Damage
Remove slings from service when
melting, charring, or weld spatter
on any part of the sling is
detected.
Physical Damage
Remove slings from service when holes, tears, cuts,
snags, broken or worn stitching, or any abrasion in the
sling cover that exposes the core yarns is found.
Other Conditions
Also remove slings for knots in the sling, general
abrasive wear, stretching, cracking, pitting, distortion,
or any other damage to the sling.

Chain Lifting Slings
Performance in Harsh Environments
Chain lifting slings provide excellent performance in harsh
environments.
When using a chain for overhead lifting, an alloy grade, either
grade 80 or 100, is recommended. Both are manufactured from
special analysis alloy steel and engineered for a superior
combination of strength and durability.
Applications
Other grade chain and components can be appropriate for
specific applications with unusual requirements.
Chain lifting slings provide excellent flexibility and resistance to
high temperatures.

Hooks
Construction and Rating
Most hooks are:
•Constructed from forged alloy steel
•Stamped with their rated safe working load (SWL)
Note that:
•The SWL applies only when the load is applied to the saddle of the hook
•When the hook is eccentrically loaded, you must reduce the hook capacity
SWL
•All hoisting hooks must have safety catches
Inspection
During inspection of hooks, look for cracks, severe corrosion, twisting of hook
body, and opening of the throat.
Hook Types
Common hook types include:
•Clevis sling hook
•Eye sling hook

Hook Pre-use Inspection
Inspection Frequency
Inspect hooks daily before use and frequently during
use.
Identification
Remove hooks from service when missing or
unreadable manufacturer identification.
Physical Damage
Remove hooks from service when cracks, nicks, or
gouges are present.
Heat Damage
Remove hooks from service when damage from heat is
detected.
Unauthorized Repairs
Remove hooks from service when unauthorized repairs
are found.
Latch Function
Remove hooks from service when improper operation
and locking of self-locking hooks is observed.
For added safety, equip hooks with a latch or close off/secure the throat opening with a mouse. Note that the function of the
latch or mouse is not to support the load.

Shackles
Primary Function
Shackles are the primary devices for attaching slings to
equipment lifting lugs.
There are many specialized shackle designs, including:
•Wide body screw pin shackle
•Screw pin D-shackle
•Wide body bolt type shackle
The image shows different types of shackles commonly
used in rigging operations. Each type has specific
applications and load capacities.

Shackle Pre-use Inspection
Inspection Frequency
Inspect shackles daily before use and frequently during use.
Required Markings
Each shackle body must have forged, cast, or die-stamped
markings by the manufacturer showing:
•Name or trademark of the manufacturer
•Rated load/capacity (WLL or SWL)
•Size
This information must not be missing and must be legible.
Remove From Service When
•Indications of heat damage, including weld spatter or arc strikes
•Excessive pitting or corrosion
•10% reduction of the original or catalogue dimension at any
point around the body or pin
•Body spread including bent, twisted, distorted, stretched,
elongated, cracked, or broken load-bearing components
•Excessive nicks or gouges
•Incomplete pin engagement, shoulder of pin not flush with
shackle body
•Excessive thread damage
•Evidence of unauthorized welding
Note: The rated capacity of shackles only applies when they are symmetrically loaded and the included angle between two sling legs is a
maximum of 120°. You must reduce shackle capacity when the angle is greater than 120°.

Load Attachment Devices
Lift Lugs
Lift lugs constitute a broad category
of load attachment devices.
They are generally custom
engineered and fabricated and
include anything from welded plates
with shackle holes to loops of rebar
embedded in concrete.
Eyebolts
Eye bolts are typically prefabricated
devices that bolt or screw into bolt
holes in the lifting equipment.
They usually have light capacity and
limited sideload capacity. The user
must closely inspect the
manufacturer's instructions to
assure safe usage of these devices.
Swivel Eyes
Swivel eyes are prefabricated devices similar to eyebolts but with the ability to
rotate.
This rotation capability helps prevent twisting of the sling during lifting
operations.

Swivel Hoist Rings
Advantages
Swivel hoist rings provide 360-degree rotation and 180-degree
pivot action, making them ideal for lifting loads that may shift or
need to be rotated during lifting.
They are designed to eliminate the side loading of eyebolts,
providing greater safety and versatility in lifting operations.
Inspection
On eye bolts and hoist swivel rings, inspect for signs of elongation,
cracks, bent pins, and other forms of damage before each use.
Proper inspection is critical as these components are often used as
primary attachment points for lifting operations.

Eyebolt Inspection and Markings
Required Markings
All eye bolts must have forged, cast, or die-stamped marking
with the:
•Name or trademark of the manufacturer
•Size or capacity
•Grade (alloy eye bolts only)
This information must not be missing and must be legible.
Inspection Frequency
Inspect eye bolts daily before use and frequently during use.
Remove From Service When
•Nicks, gouges, bent or distorted eye or shank
•Noticeable wear (10% reduction of original/catalogue
dimension at any point)
•Worn, corroded and/or distorted threads
•Indications of heat damage including weld spatter or arc
strikes
Modifications
Any alteration or repair to eye bolts, such as grinding, welding,
notching, stamping, etc., is not permissible.
Receiving Holes
Clean and inspect tapped receiving holes for thread wear and
deterioration.

Eyebolt Installation and Applications
Proper Positioning
Always position shoulder eye bolts to take the load in
the plane of the eye. An eye bolt that is "turned to the
side" will have less capacity and may experience
damage and failure when you lift a load.
Loading Angle
Do not load shoulder eye bolts at angles below 30°
unless the manufacturer approves doing so.
Non-Shoulder Eyebolts
You can only use non-shoulder eye bolts for vertical
loads. When loaded at angles, a non-shoulder eye bolt
will bend or break.
Tightening
Tighten eye bolts securely, and torque it to spec if the
manufacturer requires doing so. For angular lifts, the
shoulder must be flush, making full contact with the
load. Otherwise, only vertical lifts are permissible.
Note: Do not lift or pull loads with slings reefed from one eye bolt to another. This will change the angle of loading on the eye
bolts and create added tension.

Hoist Rings
Torque Values
Tightening torque values shown are based upon threads being clean,
dry, and free of lubrication.
Use long bolts with soft metal (i.e., aluminum) work pieces. While you
may use them with ferrous metal (i.e., steel and iron) work pieces,
short bolts function only for use with these work pieces.
Installation Steps
Follow the steps below and the manufacturer's instructions when
installing hoist rings:
•Retention nuts, when used, must have full thread engagement.
For the rated capacity to apply, use SAE 8 standard hex or
equivalent.
•Never use spacers between the bushing flange and the mounting
surface.
•Contact must be flush and in full contact with the hoist ring
bushing mating surface.
•Drilled and tapped hole must be 90° to the load surface.
•Using a torque wrench, install hoist ring to the manufacturer-
recommended and -provided torque value.
•Drilled holes must have correct diameter. Depth must be
threaded shank length plus one-half the threaded shank
diameter.

Turnbuckles
Purpose
You can use turnbuckles to level and distribute the load among
the sling.
When you intend to use turnbuckles in hoisting and rigging
applications, ensure that they are made from alloy steel or the
equivalent and not welded.
Note that you must only use turnbuckles in a straight or in-line
pull only.
Types of Turnbuckles
Common types include:
•Eye-eye turnbuckle
•Jaw-eye turnbuckle
•Jaw-jaw turnbuckle

Spreader Beams and Lifting Beams
Variety and Design
A wide variety of spreader beams come in many different design
configurations.
Normally, spreader beams and lifting beams are below-the-hook lifting
devices that lift loads with single or multiple attachment points. They
act as a crosspiece for spacing the hooks or chains that hold loads such
as bundles, rolls, cylinders, and machinery.
Types and Designs
Other types and designs of spreader beams and lifting beams include:
•Low headroom designs
•Multiple and adjustable hook locations
•Special capacities and lengths

Using Rope in Rigging Applications
Applications
You can use rope for:
•Hand hoisting of objects to elevated positions
•Tag lines
Other acceptable uses require:
•Knowledge of knots
•Knowledge of rope strength
•Fibre or synthetic rope strength
Calculating Safe Working Load
This is the rule of thumb for calculating safe working load in
pounds:
1.Change rope diameter into 8th of an inch
2.Square the numerator of the fraction
3.Multiply the result by:
•N = 20 for manila
•N = 60 for nylon and polyester
4.Example: 3/4 in manila rope
•Convert to 8th: 3/4 = 6/8
•Square the numerator: 6² = 36
•Multiply the result by N: 36 × 20 = 720 lbs

Rope Strength Reductions
Safe Working Load Application
Calculated safe working load applies to straight length of new rope.
Knots and Hitches
Additional reductions are required for knots, age, and condition. Knots, bends, and hitches reduce
the working strength of a rope:
•50% (knot)
•50% (bend)
•75% (hitch)
Age Effects
Age affects manila rope, so safe working load decreases 1% per year.
Removal Conditions
Remove all rope from service if any of the following conditions are present:
•Abnormal wear
•Powder or grit between strands
•Broken or cut fibres
•Variations in size or roundness
•Discoloration or rotting

Tag and Hoisting Lines
Regulatory Requirements
Occupational Health and Safety Code 2009, Section 70 Tag
and hoisting lines Subsections 70(1) and 70(2) states that
tag lines, usually made of nylon rope or other nonconductive
material:
•Help riggers control the motion of a suspended load
•Allow riggers to stand a safe distance away from the load
•Provide some protection from electrocution as nylon
rope is a poor conductor of electricity
Load Control
A load can move or swing dangerously if the crane boom
moves rapidly or a gust of wind catches the load. To do so,
they must be of sufficient length to allow control of the load
and must be used in a manner that ensures the rigger
holding the line will not be struck by the load.
Alternative Approaches
As an alternative to tag lines, an employer may consider
options for securing the load to the crane or controlling
equipment.

Center of Gravity and Tag Line Safety
Center of Gravity
To reduce the likelihood of a suspended load swinging or
moving uncontrollably, position the hoisting line over the
load's center of gravity. The load's "center of gravity" is the
load's balance point or center of weight.
The location of a load's center of gravity depends on the
load's shape and how its weight is distributed (i.e., heavier at
one end than the other, or distributed evenly).
Tag Line Safety Considerations
Usually, tag lines improve the level of safety for riggers. You
should not use them if there is a chance that the danger to
workers would increase. This could include a risk of:
•Contact with live electrical conductors
•Entanglement in moving machinery
•Getting caught on moving mobile equipment
As an alternative to tag lines, an employer may consider
options for securing the load to the crane or controlling
equipment.

Lifting with Hand-Operated Chain Hoists
Versatility and Applications
Lever chain hoists (or come along), which are an indispensable
tool for lifting and rigging, are available in many lifting
capacities-from 100 lb up through 5 tonnes and beyond.
You can use lever hoist, also referred to as ratchet lever hoist, in
vertical and horizontal applications. They are compact, light, and
very easy to rig into position. Since they come with top and
bottom hooks, you can rig them to just about anything
imaginable.
Mechanical Advantage
These manually operated hoisting devices enable one person to
lift heavy loads (multiple tonnes) by using a series of reduction
gears to provide a mechanical advantage and, thereby, reduce
the amount of effort (muscle energy) you need to lift a load.
Operation Guidance
Hoisting guidance operation of a hand operated chain hoist
involves more than pulling the hand chain.
The use of these hoists is subject to certain hazards that cannot
be met by mechanical means but only by the exercise of
intelligence, care, common sense, and experience in
anticipating the motions that will occur as a result of operating
the hoists.

Chain Hoist Pre-use Inspection
Designated Inspector
A designated person must conduct pre-use inspections and determine
whether conditions found constitute a hazard and a more detailed inspection
is necessary.
Documentation
Frequent inspections do not require records.
Inspection Frequency
Remember that you must inspect daily before use and frequently during use.
Identification
The hoist must have a marking with the manufacturer's name, model, serial
number, and rated load capacity attached on a plate or label, or cast, forged,
or stamped on the hoist or load block.

Chain Hoist Warnings and Labels
Label Requirements
Hoists or blocks have labels
displaying warnings and operating
procedures. Labels must comply with
ANSI Z535.4 Product safety signs
and labels.
Warning Against
•Lifting more than rated load
capacity
•Operating hoist with twisted,
kinked or damaged chain
•Operating damaged or
malfunctioning hoist
Additional Warnings
•Lifting people or lifting loads over
people
•Operating hoist other than with
human power
•Removing or obscuring labels

welding ground and must not allow welding electrodes
to contact the hoist.
Manual Operation
The operator must operate only manually (hand
power) by one operator.

Hoist Operations Safety
Requirements
Rope and Chain Management
Hoist rope or chain must not wrap around a load. Before load movement, the
operator must be sure chains are not kinked or twisted around each other.
Proper Seating
Operation of the hoist must not take place unless rope or chain is seated properly on
the drum, sheaves, or sprockets.
Load Positioning
Operation of the hoist must not take place unless centred over the load, except if it
has authorization from a qualified person.
Load Capacity
The operator must not pick up a load in excess of the rated load bearing capacity on
the hoist or load block, except during authorized tests or pre-engineered lifts.

Additional Hoist Operation
Requirements
Overload Device
The operator must not use a hoist overload limiting device to measure the maximum
load to be lifted.
Brake Testing
Each time a load approaching load capacity is handled, the operator must check hoist
brake action by lifting the load just clear of supports and continuing only after verifying
the brake system is operating properly.
Lowering Limits
Unless a lower limit device is provided, the operator must not lower the load below the
point where less than two wraps of rope remain on the anchorage of the hoist drum.
Safety Precautions
Always follow manufacturer's guidelines and safety procedures when operating hoisting
equipment.

Handling Symmetrical Loads
Equipment Inspection
Check that all crane systems
are up-to-date and in proper
working condition prior to
crane operation, including
annual inspection tags,
controls, hooks, ropes, and
brakes.
Route Planning
Check the travel route to
ensure there is sufficient
clearance for the load and
check the destination area
for adequate clearance and
floor strength.
Rigging Attachment
Attach slings/chains/wire
ropes to the load above the
center of gravity as specified
on the Lift Plan. Equalize
loading on multiple leg slings
and maintain a balanced
load.
Test Lift
Slowly lift the load until it just
begins to rise off the ground.
Stop to see if load will rise
evenly or if it will tilt. If the
load tilts, lower immediately
and reposition rigging
components.

Completing the Symmetrical
Load Lift
Notification
After the load is balanced correctly, warn everyone in the area of the impending
lift by using the facility's notification system (sounding an alarm, etc.).
Execution
Proceed by lifting the load slowly and moving the load slowly to its
destination. Keep load as low to ground as possible. Use attendants to walk
with the load, if needed, to keep it from impacting surrounding objects.
Placement
Lower the load slowly, making sure that it lines up correctly with any
blocks, timbers, or other support devices that might be needed.
Completion
Detach the rigging, and secure the equipment.

Handling Asymmetrical Loads
Center of Gravity Identification
Determine and identify the location of the load's center of gravity.
Rigging Attachment
Attach slings/chains/wire ropes to the load above the center of gravity as specified on the Lift Plan. If the only available attachment points are below
the center of gravity, stabilize the load using taglines.
Load Balancing
Equalize loading on multiple leg slings and maintain a balanced load. Protect rigging equipment and the load from sharp surfaces and damage.
Test Lift
Slowly lift the load until it just begins to rise off the ground. Stop to see if load will rise evenly or if it will tilt. If the load tilts, lower immediately and
reposition rigging components to prevent the load from listing.
Completion
After the load is balanced correctly, warn everyone, proceed with the lift keeping the load as low as possible, lower carefully, and detach rigging.
