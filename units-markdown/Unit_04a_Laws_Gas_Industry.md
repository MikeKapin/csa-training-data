## 1.3 Where the term "propane" is used,

the requirements of this Code include,
and apply equally to, any material that
is composed predominantly of any of
the following hydrocarbons or
mixtures of them: propane, propylene,
butanes (normal and isobutane), and
butylenes.

Application of Propane
Regulation
Determining Application
It is obviously important to determine whether the regulation
applies to the type of installation or activity that you are working
on. Read Clause 2. of this regulation, which identifies what it does
and does not apply to.
Exemptions
Installations that are exempt are subject to requirements
established in other legal documents. For example, appliance
installations on boats are subject to the federal Canada Shipping
Act.

Risk and Safety Management Plans
2009 Amendments
Amendments to O. Reg 211/01 in
2009 now require propane filling
plants and facilities to have a safety
plan in effect to identify how a
licensed operator would handle a
hazardous event, such as a fire or
explosion, in the interest of public
safety.
Regulation Clause 3.1 (1)
A person who holds a license to
operate a retail outlet, filling plant,
cardlock/keylock, private outlet or
container refill centre shall prepare
a risk and safety management plan,
which shall, at a minimum, address
the following matters:
Hazard Analysis
Requirements
A hazard analysis that identifies
possible hazardous scenarios, the
frequency of those scenarios and
their consequences, and that takes
into account, the most severe
incident or situation that could
occur at the referenced facility
based on the total capacity of
propane at the referenced facility,
and any less severe incident or
situation that could occur at the
referenced facility.

Employer Duties in Propane Regulation
Similar to Gaseous Fuels Regulation
Clauses 5. (1) and (2) dealing with duties of an employer are
similar to Clauses 11. (1) and (2) of the Gaseous Fuels
Regulation 212/01 section.
Certification Requirements
This regulation endorses the requirement to receive
certification in accordance with the Fuel Industry Certificates
Regulation. Like the Gaseous Fuels Regulation, this
regulation provides a limited exemption for lower-level
certificate holders to conduct activities requiring higher-
level certificate holders when working in the actual presence
of the appropriate level certificate holder. See Clauses 8. (1)
and (2) of the Regulation.

Initial Activation in Propane Regulation
Specific Duties
Initial activation of an installation
supplied for the first time entails
specific duties, responsibilities, and
liabilities.
Regulation Clause 9.(1)
Where premises are connected to a
supply of propane for the first time, no
person shall put into use for the first
time an appliance in the premises that
is connected to a propane supply until
the distributor has examined the
installation of the appliance and is
satisfied that the installation and use
of the appliance are in compliance
with this Regulation.
Examination Requirements
9.(2)
An examination under subsection (1)
shall include the examination of all
appliances to be installed at the time
of occupation of the premises.

Practical Application of
Initial Activation
Limited Application
Sub clause (2) places a new condition on the distributor to ensure
the examination of all the appliances intended for use. The
practical application of this clause is limited since this regulation
only applies to appliance installations on highway vehicles, RVs,
mobile homes, outdoor food service Units, and wash-mobiles.
Distributor Definition Impact
Furthermore, the definition of distributor effectively excludes
these types of installations since a person supplying propane to a
vehicle or cylinder is not a distributor.

Prohibited Activities
Without Approval
Regulation Reference
Refer to Clause 12. (1) and (2) of the Propane Storage and Handling
Regulation.
Similarity to Gaseous Fuels Regulation
Note that these clauses are similar to Clauses 4. (1) and (2) of the
Gaseous Fuels Regulation 212/01 section.

Accident Reporting in
Propane Regulation
Regulation Reference
Refer to Clauses 15. (1), (2), and (3) of the Propane Storage and
Handling Regulation.
Similarity to Gaseous Fuels Regulation
Note that these clauses are similar to Clauses 12. (1), (2), and (3) of
the Gaseous Fuels Regulation 212/01 section.

Safe Operation
Responsibilities
Unique to Propane Regulation
This regulation has two important sections not found in the Gaseous
Fuels Regulation.
Importance
The following clauses clearly speak about the responsibilities of all
parties and, as such, deserve close review and consideration.

Compliance Requirements
Regulation Clause 16
No person shall knowingly supply
propane to or use an appliance, a
container, equipment, a propane
vehicle, a work or other thing
employed in the handling or use of
propane that does not comply with
this Regulation or, where it was
installed before this Regulation came
into force, that does not comply with
the requirements of the predecessor
to this Regulation as it existed when it
was installed.
Regulation Clause 17.(1)
An owner and every person
responsible for the operation of an
appliance, a container, equipment, a
work or any other thing employed in
the handling or use of propane shall
ensure that it is maintained in a safe
operating condition.
Regulation Clause 17.(2)
No person shall operate or permit to
be operated, an appliance or work
unless it is maintained in a safe
operating condition and it complies
with this Regulation or, where it was
installed before this Regulation came
into force, that it complies with the
requirements of the predecessor to
this Regulation as it existed when it
was installed.

Maintenance
Responsibilities
Leading Cause of Accidents
Failure to maintain appliances in a safe operating condition is the
single largest cause of accidents. Past regulations recognize the
responsibility of owners and users to maintain the equipment.
Customer Advisement
Certificate holders may wish to advise their customers about their
legal responsibilities by referencing Clause 17 above.

Distributor's Ongoing
Responsibilities
Continuous Duties
The distributor's duties and responsibilities do not end with the
initial examination required under Clause 9 nor with the action
required when an unacceptable condition is identified (as
discussed below). They are ongoing like the propane supply,
transfer, or transportation operations.
Inspection Requirements
No distributor shall supply propane to premises where the
propane is to be used in an appliance or work unless the
distributor is satisfied that the installation and use of the
appliance or work complies with the Act and this Regulation.

Inspection Requirements
10-Year Inspection
Unless the distributor has inspected the appliance or work at least once
within the previous 10 years; or
2
Quality Assurance Program
Unless the distributor has inspected the appliance or work in
accordance with a quality assurance inspection program.
Report Requirements
A distributor shall prepare a report of every inspection made under
subsection (1) and shall retain the report until the next inspection and
report are completed.
Qualified Inspector
An inspection shall only be carried out by a person who is the holder of
a certificate for that purpose.

Exemptions and Quality Assurance Program
Exemptions
This section does not apply to propane vehicles, industrial
vehicles or to appliances on highway vehicles or recreational
vehicles.
Quality Assurance Program
Reference to a quality assurance program in Part 1 (b)
consists of a set of policies and procedures for auditing and
responding to existing installation concerns. It must meet
the approval of the director and is subject to audit by TSSA.

Unacceptable Conditions in
Propane Regulation
Similar to Gaseous Fuels Regulation
The duties and responsibilities of distributors, certificate holders,
and owners concerning unacceptable conditions as outlined in
Clause 19 of the Propane Storage and Handling Regulation are
similar to those that Section 2 under Clause 13 of the Gaseous
Fuels Regulation 212/01 section describes.
Regulation Reference
For clarification of this important set of requirements, read the
entire Clause 20 of the Propane storage and handling regulation.

Approval of Propane Appliances and Equipment
Regulation Reference
Clauses 21 and 22 of the Propane
Storage and Handling Regulation
addresses approval of appliances in a
manner similar to the Gaseous Fuels
Regulation 212/01 section.
Cylinder Approval
Transport Canada (TC) is the
organization designated to approve
propane cylinders.
Tank Markings
Propane tanks must bear a marking of
the Canadian Registration Number
(CRN) or Ontario Identification
Number (OIN) and the manufacturer's
name before you can consider it
approved.

Propane Tank Markings
These images show examples of proper markings on propane tanks that indicate they have been approved for use.

Contractor Registration in
Propane Regulation
Regulation Reference
Refer to Clause 23 of the Propane Storage and Handling
Regulation for requirements dealing with contractors and vehicle
conversion centre operation.
Similarity to Gaseous Fuels Regulation
Requirements are similar to Clause 21 of the Gaseous Fuels
Regulation.

Other Sections of Propane
Regulation
Additional Content
The remainder of the Propane Storage and Handling Regulation
deals with issues related to distributor's facilities, filling plants,
cylinder handling facilities, and retail outlets.
Recommendation
Those involved in the storage, handling, transportation, or transfer
of propane should review the entire regulation.

Summary of Key Responsibilities
Certificate Holders
Maintain proper certification, identify and address unsafe conditions
Distributors
Inspect installations, shut off unsafe appliances, maintain records
Contractors
Maintain registration, employ certified technicians, follow regulations
Owners/Users

Reading and Interpreting
the Code
Researching a specific issue in the Codes can be a time-consuming and
frustrating experience. Although many gas technicians are experienced
with code use, some simple tricks or tips can make the exercise easier
and more reliable for those less familiar with the Codes. This
presentation focuses on using various navigational techniques to access
information contained in the Codes.

Purpose and Objectives
Purpose
To provide guidance on efficiently researching and interpreting
gas codes for technicians
Learning Objectives
By the end of this presentation, you will understand the CSA
B149.1 Scope, terminology, organizational structure, navigational
aids, and interpretation processes

Key Terminology in the CSA
B149 Code
TermDefinition
AndIndicates that you must meet all the
requirements that a word links
MayIndicates an advisory or optional
statement
OrIndicates that you must meet only
one of the requirements that a word
links
ShallIndicates a mandatory requirement
ShouldIndicates a recommendation or that
which is advised but not mandatory

Understanding "Shall" in the Code

## 1.6 In this Code, unless approved otherwise by the authority having jurisdiction, "shall" indicates a mandatory requirement; "should"

indicates a recommendation or that which is advised but not mandatory; "may" indicates an advisory or optional statement.
Shall
Mandatory requirement
Should
Recommendation (not mandatory)
May
Advisory or optional

Scope of the CSA B149
Codes
CSA B149.1
Natural gas and propane
installation code for buildings
and residential installations
CSA B149.2
Propane storage and handling
code, including recreational
vehicles
CSA B149.3
Code for the field approval of fuel-related components on
appliances and equipment
The first section of each Code outlines its scope — what it covers and
does not cover. It's essential to determine which Code applies to your
specific situation.

Multiple Code Applications
Residential
Typically requires only CSA B149.1
Recreational Vehicles
Requires CSA B149.2
Industrial
May require all three Codes
Equipment Approval
May require CSA B149.3
In some cases, more than one Code may apply. For example, industrial propane-fired process ovens may require compliance
with all three Codes.

Understanding "And" vs "Or" in Requirements
"And" in Requirements
The use of "and" indicates that you must meet all the
requirements that the word links.
"Or" in Requirements
The use of "or" indicates that you must meet only one of the
requirements that the word links.

Example of "And" vs "Or" in
Clauses
Clause with "And"
You must comply with both (a) AND (b) requirements
Clause with "Or"
Clause 6.4.2 gives you an option to use either (a) OR (b), but you
shall use one of the two methods
Pay careful attention to these connecting words as they determine
whether you need to meet all requirements or just one of several options.

Definitions and Abbreviations
Definitions
Words or terms appear in the definition pages of Section 3
of the Code. Both common and unusual terms have specific
meanings necessary for interpreting and applying the Code
as intended.
Abbreviations
The Codes use abbreviated names of organizations. Annex I
of CSA B149.1 identifies each company or organization
mentioned within the pages of the Code.

Reference Publications
Section 2 Listings
Section 2 lists all the
reference material the
Code uses
Ontario Standards
A complete listing of
standards adopted in
Ontario is available from
TSSA in a document called
"Titles of Standards and
Laboratory Test Reports
Authorized in the Province
of Ontario"
Cross-Reference Necessity
It is sometimes necessary to refer to a standard or code
referenced in CSA B149 to fully understand and comply with a
requirement

Navigating the CSA B149.1

Subsection Level
Identify the specific subject matter
Clause Level
Read the specific requirement in context with higher levels
Always read a clause in context with the subject covered in the higher-
level subsection and section to ensure proper interpretation.

Changes and Highlighting
Identifying Changes
Changes from a previous
edition of the Code are not
identified in the 2020 editions,
and you may only find a
change through careful
comparison with the previous
edition
Previous Editions
The 2015 edition of the CSA
B149 series codes included a
delta (Δ) in the margin to
highlight changes
Best Practices
Mark sections you commonly reference with tabs and highlight
important clauses relevant to your work

Practical Tips for Code Use
Keep Current
The current applicable Code should be readily available to every
technician
Highlight Key Sections
Identify commonly used sections with tabs and highlighting
Mark Sizing Tables
Clearly identify piping and tubing sizing tables to avoid mistakes
between natural gas and propane tables
Compliance Expectation
A gas technician is expected to comply with all Code requirements

Understanding Annexes
What Are Annexes?
At the back of the Code, you will find a section entitled
"Annexes." This section contains engineering tables,
procedures, and information developed to assist you with:
•Sizing piping/tubing systems
•Sizing vents
•Procedures for purging
•Protection of piping, meters, or tanks
•Other technical information
Mandatory vs. Guideline
How a clause references an annex determines whether the
annex information is a requirement or a guideline:
•If referenced as one means of compliance, it's a guideline
•If specifically required by a clause, it becomes mandatory
Example: Clause 6.23.7 specifically requires compliance with
Annex H, making Annex H a requirement.

Example: Annex References
Guideline Example
Clause 6.3.2 of CSA B149.1 requires sizing of the piping/tubing
system so that the pressure drop never exceeds 1 in w.c., when the
supply pressure is between 7-14 in w.c. The Clause references the
tables in the annexes only as one means of achieving this core
requirement.
Mandatory Example
Clause 6.23.7 specifically requires compliance with Annex H, which
makes Annex H a requirement.

Ontario Requirements
Code Adoption

Ontario amendments in the
Code Adoption Document
(available on coloured
pages) have amended the
national Code
Best Practice
Cross out any amended
sections in the Code and
note the applicable page or

Application of Current Code
to Existing Installations
Grandfathering Principle
Existing installations that were
compliant when installed can
generally remain in operation,
even if they don't meet current
Code requirements
Significant Changes
If the installation has a
significant change or addition,
the entire installation must be
brought into compliance with
current requirements
Due Diligence
Consider the reason or intent of code changes to ensure that older
installations remain safe

Example: Chimney Liner
Requirements
Pre-1978
CSA B149 Codes allowed venting of an appliance into an unlined chimney
2
1978 Code Change
New requirement for clay-tile liner or metal liner in a chimney
Existing Installations
Appliances installed before the code change could remain in operation
Modifications After 1978
If the pre-1978 appliance was replaced, moved, or if another appliance
was added to the chimney, the entire installation would need to comply
with current requirements

Conflicting Legal Requirements
Multiple Codes
Consider all applicable codes and
standards
1
Conflict Resolution
Direct interpretations to the
authorities having jurisdiction
Precedence
Technical Standards and Safety Act
prevails over municipal by-laws
Due Diligence
Apply the most stringent
requirement when conflicts exist

Electrical Requirements Example

## 4.7 .1 Electrical connections between an appliance and building wiring shall comply with the local electrical code or, in the

absence of such, with the Canadian Electrical Code, Part I.
Fuel Technician Scope
The Fuel Industry Certificate Regulation specifies the
aspects of electrical work that require fuel technician
certification
Electrician Requirements
The regulation also defines limits beyond which the
technician must have a valid certificate of qualification as an
electrician issued under the Trades Qualification and
Apprenticeship Act

Hierarchy in Conflicts
Technical Standards and Safety Act
Prevails over municipal by-laws
2
Act, Regulations, Codes
Prevail over manufacturer's instructions
Most Stringent Requirement
Apply when municipal by-laws or manufacturer's
instructions are more stringent
In no case must the end result be less than the code requires.

Interpreting the Code
Disputes and Grey
Areas
Disputes and grey areas in
interpreting the Codes are
inevitable and actually
positive

made to Fuels Safety, TSSA
This is the official channel for resolving code interpretation
questions specific to Ontario regulations

Scope of CSA B149.1
Purpose
The first section of the Code
outlines its scope — what it
covers and does not cover
Location
Found in Section 1 of the Code
Importance
Essential to determine if CSA B149.1 is applicable to your specific
installation
It would be useless to apply the CSA B149.1 requirements to a propane
installation on a recreational vehicle since only the CSA B149.2 applies to
those installations.

Definitions in CSA B149.1
Location
Words or terms appear in the definition pages of Section 3
of the Code
Importance
Both common and unusual terms have a specific meaning
that is necessary for interpreting the Code Section and
applying it as intended
Always check the definitions section when encountering terms that may have specific technical meanings within the context
of the Code.

Notes in the Code
Text Notes
Notes to the text do not
include mandatory or
alternative requirements. The
purpose of a note is to
separate explanatory or
informative material from the
text.

Using the Index Effectively
Start with Specific Terms
Begin your search with the most specific term related to
your question
Example: If looking for clearance requirements for a water
heater, look under "water heater" first
Try Alternative Terms
If you don't find what you need, try related terms or more
general categories
Example: If "water heater" doesn't yield results, try
"appliances, clearances" or just "clearances"

Using the Table of Contents
Broad Categories
Identify which major section might contain your topic
Drill Down
Look at subsections under the main heading
Check Multiple Sections
Remember that requirements on a topic may appear in multiple
sections
Example
Pressure testing requirements appear in three different sections
of CSA B149.1

Practical Example: Finding
Venting Requirements
Check the Index
Look under "venting" or the specific appliance type
Review Table of Contents
Find the section on "Venting systems and air supply"
Identify Specific Subsections
Locate subsections on your specific venting question (e.g.,
"Venting systems for Category I appliances")

Practical Example: Pressure Testing
Multiple Locations
Pressure testing requirements appear in three different
sections of CSA B149.1:
•Initial installation testing
•Testing after service work
•Annual inspection requirements
Finding All Requirements
To ensure complete compliance, you need to:
1.Check the index under "pressure testing"
2.Review all referenced sections
3.Consider which scenario applies to your situation

Ontario Code Adoption
Document
Purpose
Contains Ontario-specific
amendments to the national
CSA B149 Codes
Format
Usually printed on colored
pages for easy identification
Legal Status
These amendments have the same legal force as the Code itself
It is essential to check these amendments as they may significantly alter
the requirements in the national Code.

Marking Up Your Code Book
Cross Out Amended Sections
Cross out any sections in the national Code that have been
amended by Ontario
Note References
Add notes referring to the applicable page in the amendment
section
Add Tabs
Mark frequently referenced sections with tabs for quick access
Highlight Key Requirements
Use highlighting for important clauses relevant to your daily work

Identifying Piping and Tubing Tables
Common Mistake
One common error is sizing natural gas systems using
propane tables or vice versa
Best Practice
Clearly mark the different sizing tables with colored tabs or
labels to prevent confusion
Always double-check which fuel type the table applies to
before using it

Applying Code to Existing Installations
Original Installation
Compliant with code at time of
installation
Code Changes
New requirements in updated codes
2
Continued Operation
Existing installations generally
remain compliant
Modifications
Changes trigger compliance with
current code

What Constitutes a "Significant
Change"?
Appliance Replacement
Installing a new appliance in place of an old one
Relocation
Moving an existing appliance to a new location
System Expansion
Adding additional appliances to an existing system
Major Repairs
Substantial modifications to the original installation
Any of these changes would typically require bringing the entire installation into compliance
with current code requirements.

Due Diligence with Older
Installations
Assess Safety Impact
Consider why the code requirement changed
Evaluate Risk
Determine if the non-compliance presents a safety hazard
Inform Customer
Advise of any potential safety concerns, even if technically
compliant with old code
Document Findings
Record your assessment and recommendations

Considering Other Legal
Requirements
Electrical Code
Governs electrical
connections and
components
Building Code
Addresses
structural and fire
safety
requirements
Municipal By-
laws
May impose
additional local
requirements
Manufacturer's
Instructions
Specific
requirements for
equipment

When applying the Codes, remember to also consider these other legal requirements to
ensure your installation meets all applicable regulations.

Electrical Requirements for Gas Appliances
CSA B149.1 Requirement

## 4.7 .1 Electrical connections between an appliance and

building wiring shall comply with the local electrical code
or, in the absence of such, with the Canadian Electrical
Code, Part I.
Certificate Limitations
The Fuel Industry Certificate Regulation specifies:
•What electrical work gas technicians can perform
•When an electrician's certificate is required

Resolving Conflicts Between Requirements
Identify the Conflict
Determine exactly where requirements differ
2
Check Precedence
Review which requirement takes legal priority
Apply Most Stringent
When in doubt, follow the stricter requirement
Seek Interpretation
Contact authorities having jurisdiction if unclear

Legal Precedence in Conflicts
Act vs. Municipal By-law
In the event of a conflict between
the Technical Standards and Safety
Act, 2000 (including the
regulations, codes, and standards)
and a municipal by-law, the Act
prevails.
Act vs. Manufacturer's
Instructions
In the event of a conflict between
the Act, regulations, or codes and a
manufacturer's certified
instructions, the Act, regulations, or
codes prevail.
Due Diligence Principle
If municipal by-laws or
manufacturer's instructions are
more stringent than the code
requirement, the most stringent
clause must take effect.

Submitting a Request for
Interpretation
Prepare Your Request
Include the specific clause, an illustrative sketch if appropriate, and
explanation of the field condition
Submit to CSA
Email to inquiries@csagroup.org with "Request for
interpretation" in the subject line
For Ontario-Specific Interpretations
Submit a written request to Fuels Safety, TSSA

Phrasing Interpretation Requests
Effective Request Format
Where possible, phrase the request in such a way that a
specific "yes" or "no" answer will address the issue
This helps ensure you receive a clear, actionable response
Example
Instead of asking: "What are the requirements for venting a
water heater near a window?"
Ask: "Does Clause X.X.X permit the installation of a water
heater vent termination 10 inches horizontally from an
openable window?"
