Gas input required for in-space supplemental heaters (Btu/h per cu ft house volume)

Venting Classification
Unvented
Unvented space heaters are
designed so that the room within
which the appliance is installed
both provides the combustion air
and has the flue products
exhausted into it.
It is not permissible to install
unvented space heaters in
residential buildings in most
provinces of Canada.
Direct-vent
Direct-vent space heaters have
combustion air supplied directly
from the outside and the flue
products are also exhausted to the
outdoors. The exhaust vent and
combustion air inlet are often
combined in one unit.
Vented
Vented appliances take the combustion air from the room and exhaust the
products of combustion to the outdoors.

Venting Requirements
Follow Manufacturer's Instructions
Installation instructions provide specific information on venting
materials and installation parameters
Wall Thickness
Maximum and minimum wall thickness allowed for direct-vent
appliances
Vent Material
B, BW, single wall within heated space; special venting for outdoor use
Starter Vent Kit
Manufacturers often provide a starter vent kit with the appliance
including vent, spacers, collars, terminals, etc.

Masonry Chimney Requirements
Do
•Inspect the masonry chimney before installing the unit
•Make sure that the chimney's clay flue liner is not
cracked, soft, or spalled
•Verify that mortar joints between liner sections are in
place and tight
•Clean creosote from the top, sides, and back of a
masonry firebox before installing a non-vented
decorative appliance
•Check whether your local codes require the fireplace
damper to be clamped open or removed
Do Not
•Share a gas-fired appliance flue with a wood-burning
appliance
Proper vent termination for any gas-fired appliance is
critical to the overall safe and efficient functioning of the
venting system. The vent terminal clearance criteria for
space heaters follows standard practice as outlined in Unit
22 Venting Practices.

General Installation Considerations
1
Location
Due to high temperatures, the appliance should be located out of traffic and away from
furniture and draperies.
2
Clear Area
The appliance area must remain clear and free from combustible materials, gasoline,
and other flammable vapours and liquids.
3
Glass Integrity
If the appliance has glass, it should not be operated with the glass removed, cracked, or
broken. Replacement of the glass should be done by a licensed or qualified service
person.
4
Floor Protection
If installing the heating appliance on carpet, vinyl tile, or any combustible material, it
must be first installed on a metal or wood panel extending the full width and depth of the
appliance.

Installation in Special Locations
Garage Installation
If installed in a residential garage,
the heater must be protected from
damage and must be located no
less than 18 inches (396 mm) above
the floor.
Sleeping Room Installation
A room heater may be installed in a
sleeping room provided that it is of
the automatic temperature control
type, is equipped with a pressure
regulator, has a 100% safety shut-
off, and is vented.
Bathroom Installation
Space heaters installed in a
bathroom must be of the direct-
vent type.

Combustion Air Requirements
Air Supply
Because many space heaters receive their combustion air
from the room, it is very important that the air supply inlets
at the front or side of the appliance remain free from
obstruction.
Room heaters should not be used in a room that has limited
air exchange with adjacent spaces, since combustion air is
required for the space.
Customer Instructions
Typically, the manufacturer's instructions provide cautions
concerning any potential dangers:
•Children and adults should be alerted to the hazards of
high surface temperature and stay away to avoid burns
or clothing ignition
•Young children need careful supervision when in the
same room as the heating unit
•Clothing and other flammable material should not be
placed on or near the heating unit

Thermostat Installation
Position on Inside Wall
Install external thermostat on an inside wall in the same room as the
heater
Proper Height
Position about 5 ft (150 cm) above the floor
Easy Access
Ensure position provides ready access to wiring, temperature
adjustment, and servicing
Avoid Problem Areas
Do not locate in unusually warm/cold areas, direct sunlight, near
heat sources, or areas with poor air circulation

Millivolt Thermostats
Special Requirements
The requirements for locating millivolt thermostats are
somewhat different because the power supply is self-
generated, and the system can therefore power only a
limited number of components.
Since the thermostat wire in the system adds resistance —
resulting in a voltage drop - the size of the wire is
proportional to the distance between the thermostat and
the appliance. For example, a larger gauge of wire has less
resistance, therefore the thermostat can be located further
from the appliance.
Size of copper wire (solid
or stranded)
Distance between
thermostat and heater
14 GA100 ft (30 m)
16 GA64 ft (19.2 m)
18 GA40 ft (12 m)
20 GA25 ft (7.5 m)
22 GA16 ft (4.8 m)

Programmable Thermostats
Compatibility with
Millivolt Systems
Some electronic
programmable thermostats
are compatible with millivolt
systems since many now
utilize a battery backup power
supply.
No Transformer
Required
Many modern programmable
thermostats do not require a
24-volt transformer to power
the thermostat.
Verification Required
Always confirm the thermostat compatibility prior to installation.

General Maintenance
Considerations
Regular Cleaning
Space heaters require regular cleaning, both inside and out. More frequent
cleaning may be required due to excessive lint from carpeting, bedding
material, etc.
Safety First
Before cleaning and inspecting, make sure the appliance is cool to the touch.
At least one hour before, have the customer turn off the heater.
Replace Safety Components
Any safety screen, guard, or glass removed for servicing the heating units
must be replaced before operating the appliance.
Annual Inspection
The heating unit should be inspected before use and at least annually.

Maintenance Requirements
Keep Clean
Control compartments, burners, and circulating air passageways of the
appliance must be kept clean and clear from obstruction.
Check for Leaks
After inspection and cleaning, use a leak detector or soap solution to check
for gas leaks at all joints before restarting the appliance.
Maintain Seals
Re-seal the silicone seal where the igniter wire and the thermocouple or
thermopile wires enter the combustion chamber if broken during
maintenance or servicing.
Apply Sealant
Apply high-temperature silicone sealant to ensure a total seal is maintained.

Typical Maintenance Procedure
Turn Off Power
Turn off the electrical power to the appliance
Remove Panels
Remove cabinet or panels
Inspect Interior
Examine the inside of the cabinet for foreign objects
Clean Components
Vacuum dust and lint from the control compartment and
heat exchanger area
Check Venting
Carefully examine the venting system

Burner and Blower Maintenance
Burner Cleaning
Clean the burner and burner ports if required. A cast-iron
burner that has lint under the burner ports can be cleaned by
running water through the top of the burner and out
through the throat.
Blower Maintenance
Clean the blower assembly with a brush and vacuum.
Clean glass components used for observing the flame with
fireplace glass cleaner since ammonia-based glass cleaners
may harm the specialty glass.
Note: Do not use abrasives on the cabinet or glass. It will scratch the surface finish and glass.

Room Heaters
Definition
A room heater — also referred to as a space heater — is a
self-contained, free-standing, non-recessed, gas-burning
appliance that furnishes direct warm air to the space in
which it is installed without ducting.
Heat Transfer
It converts the fuel energy to convection and radiant heat by
transferring heat from flue gases to the circulating air
through a heat exchanger. The heated air can be distributed
through natural convection or with a circulating air blower.

Types of Room Heaters
Gravity Vented
May be equipped with an
optional circulating air fan, but
they perform satisfactorily
with or without a fan.
Fan-Type Vented
Equipped with an integral
circulating air fan, which is
necessary for satisfactory
performance.
Unvented
In some jurisdictions, unvented radiant or convection heaters are
permitted. These heaters range in size from 10,000 to 40,000 Btu/h
(3 to 12 kW) and may require an outside air intake.

Fan Operation in Room Heaters
Electrical Requirements
When fitted with a fan, the room heater must be electrically
connected and grounded in accordance with the Canadian
Electrical Code.
Fan Switch Positions
•In the AUTO position, the fan comes on automatically
once the heater has reached a certain temperature. The
fan automatically shuts off once the temperature of the
heater decreases.
•The MAN position is for constant fan operation, mainly in
the summer.

Venting for Room Heaters
Venting Options
Vented room heaters are vented through a listed B vent, a
factory-built chimney, or a lined masonry chimney.
Code Compliance
Installations must be done according to CSA B149.1 for
clearances from combustibles, horizontal runs and
changes in direction, and flue pipes in unheated areas.
Oxygen Depletion Sensor
Unvented gas-heating equipment must include a device
that shuts off the heater if the oxygen in the room becomes
inadequate.
Installation Restrictions
Unvented room heaters may not be installed in hotels,
motels, or rooms of institutions such as hospitals or nursing
homes.

Combustion Air for Room Heaters
Air Exchange Requirements
Room heaters should not be used in a room that has limited
air exchange with adjacent spaces, since combustion air is
required for the space.
These heaters have a draft relief opening under the hood at
the back of the unit. This must not be altered or obstructed,
and the unit must be installed so the hood is in the same
atmospheric pressure zone as the combustion air inlet to the
burner.
Verifying Proper Draft
You can verify the draw of the flue gases by holding a
smoking match near the draft diverter opening. If smoke is
not drawn into the draft diverter, turn the unit off and check
for the problem causing lack of draft.
The draft diverter may be reversible so that the vent can be
connected vertically or horizontally. The manufacturer will
have limitations on the length of the horizontal run.

Gas Valves for Room Heaters
TypeDescription
Single-stage control valveThe full on-off single-stage valve is controlled by a wall thermostat.
Models are available that are powered by a 24 V supply or are self-
generating.
Two-stage control valveThe two-stage type (with hydraulic thermostat) fires at either full
input (100% of rating) or at some reduced stop, which can be as low as
20% of the heating rate. The amount of time at the reduced firing rate
depends on the heating load and the relative oversizing of the heater.
Modulating control valveThe modulating control valve (with hydraulic thermostat) starts on to
a low fire and then either cycles off and on at the low fire (if the heating
load is light), or gradually increases its heat output to meet any higher
heating load that cannot be met with the low firing rate.
Manual control valveThe manual control valve is controlled by the user rather than the
thermostat. The user adjusts the fuel flow and, thus, the level of fire to
suit heating requirements.

Thermostats for Room Heaters
Wall Thermostat
The wall thermostat turns the automatic valve to either full
on or full off. These thermostats are available in 24 V and
millivolt systems. The 24 V system requires an external
power source and a 24 V transformer. Wall thermostats
respond to temperature changes and turn the automatic
valve to either full on or off.
The millivolt system requires no external power, since the
power is generated by a thermopile. Thermopiles are
commonly available in 250 or 750 millivolt sizes. Choose the
size that will supply sufficient power for the system
components.
Built-in Hydraulic Thermostat
Built-in hydraulic thermostats are available in two types:
•Snap-action thermostats built with a liquid-filled
capillary tube that responds to changes in temperature
and turns the valve to either full on or full off.
•Modulating thermostats are similar to the snap-action
type, except that the valve comes on and shuts off at a
preset minimum input. The temperature alters the input
anywhere from full on to the minimum input. When the
heating requirements are satisfied, the unit shuts off.

Room Heater Maintenance
Keep Critical Areas Clean
The most important areas to keep clean of dust and lint are:
Burner Components
Burner ports and air inlets, orifices, pilot orifice and hood
Shields and Grilles
Top of burner shield and grilles
Control Area
Gas control area
Note: Any safety screen or guard removed for servicing the room heater
must be replaced before operating the heater.

Unit Heaters
Applications
Power-vented, low static axial fan unit heaters are now
available for residential and commercial/industrial use.
Approved for utility applications such as residential garages,
these units provide an affordable way to heat a space such
as a garage when fast and intermittent heat is needed.
Installation Considerations
Units should always be installed following all codes and the
manufacturer's certified instructions. Arrange to blow
toward or along exposed wall surfaces, if possible. Where
two or more units are installed in the same room, a general
scheme of air circulation should be maintained for best
results.
Suspended heaters are most effective when located as close
to the working zone as possible; keep this in mind when
determining the mounting heights to be used.

Unit Heater Placement
Optimal Positioning
Care should be exercised to avoid directing the discharged air directly onto the
room occupants.
Avoid Obstructions
Consider partitions, columns, counters, or other obstructions when locating the
unit heater so that a minimum quantity of air flow will be deflected by such
obstacles.
Center Placement
When units are located in the center of the space to be heated, the air should be
discharged toward the exposed walls.
Cold Air Sources
At those points where infiltration of cold air is excessive, such as at entrance
doors and shipping doors, it is desirable to locate the unit so that it will discharge
directly toward the source of cold air.

Types of Gas Unit Heaters: Airflow Fans
Axial Fans
Axial fans produce low-pressure, high-volume air flows which are designed to be
suspended within the space to be heated. These types of units are not to be
connected to ductwork; they are well suited to space heating in the same area
where the unit is located.
Blower Type Units
Blower type units, or centrifugal fans, are designed for heavy duty applications
such as continuous operation or where a single unit heater must do the entire
heating job in a large area. They can be used with the standard adjustable louvres,
with short duct runs, or with discharge nozzles for spot heating.

Types of Gas Unit Heaters: Vent Types
Gravity Vented Units
Older technology with low efficiency (approx. 80%).
Power Vented Models
With motorized vent exhausters increase efficiency
(approx. 84%) and permit the use of horizontal venting or
in areas of slight depressurization.

Types of Gas Unit Heaters: Combustion Air Supply
Conventional Units
Draw their combustion air from the same zone as where the unit is installed.
Separated Combustion Units
Designed to be installed where dusty, dirty, or mildly corrosive conditions exist or where high humidity or
slightly negative pressures prevail. Units are supplied with outside air via a separate air pipe, which may be
connected to a common concentric termination kit.

Types of Gas Unit Heaters: Efficiency
Non-condensing Power Vented Units
Achieve efficiencies of approximately 84%; the remaining
exhausted heat is necessary to keep the products of
combustion from condensing and possibly corroding the
unit and/or venting system.
Condensing Units
For efficiencies above 90%, the unit will need to extract part
of the latent heat from the products of combustion. This
process forms condensation, which is collected and directed
to a drainage point inside the unit.
These units will be equipped with a location at the base of
the unit for connecting to a condensate drain. There will also
be a special venting system as the vent system will be
operating at a positive pressure.

Condensate Drain
Requirements
Avoid Copper
Do not use copper for condensate drains as the water condensed from the
products of combustion will be acidic.
Liquid Traps Required
Condensate drains will also require liquid traps to prevent vent gas from
exiting into the drainage system.
Neutralization May Be Required
Some jurisdictions may require the condensate to be neutralized prior to
connecting to the building drainage system.
Check Local Requirements
Check the local by-laws and with the authority having jurisdiction.

Unit Heater Temperature Control
Single-stage Control
Units have a simple on/off gas valve activated by a low
voltage single-stage thermostat. Units with a summer
fan option (G thermostat connection) require a
thermostat with a Fan Auto-On switch, so the unit's fan
can be energized without a call for heat.
Two-stage Control
Units require a digital two-stage thermostat to switch
between high and low firing rates.
Multiple Heater Control
Units with a multiple heater control option can use one
thermostat to control multiple heaters.
Electronic Modulating Control
Units have an electronic modulating gas valve that will
require a matching modulating thermostat to adjust the
firing rate from approximately 40% to 100%, which will
vary the discharged air temperature to more closely
match the needs of the space.

High Limit Control for Unit Heaters
Purpose
All units are equipped with a temperature-activated auto
reset limit control. This safety device provides protection in
case of motor failure or lack of airflow due to a restriction at
the inlet or outlet.
Operation
The control is factory-set and is non-adjustable. If the
setpoint is reached, the limit control will interrupt the
electric supply to the gas valve.

Wall Furnaces
Definition
A wall furnace is a self-contained vented appliance with
grilles that is designed to be permanently installed against
or within an inside wall of a building. It furnishes heated air
that is circulated by natural or forced convection.
Capacity Range
Wall furnaces range from 10,000 to 90,000 Btu/h (3 to 26
KW) and are classified as:
•Conventional; or
•Direct-vent

Conventional Wall Furnaces
Air Circulation
In conventional units, the cool room air enters at the
bottom and is warmed as it passes over the heat
exchanger, entering the room through the grillwork at
the top of the heater.
Top-Vent Design
The flue gases exit at the top of the vent at the top of
the heater; for this reason, they are also referred to as
top-vent wall furnaces.
Counterflow Option
Some conventional units are available as counterflow
units, which use fans to reverse the natural flow of air
across the heat exchanger. Air enters at the top of the
furnace and discharges at or near the floor.
Mounting Options
Wall furnaces come in recessed or surface mounted
models. The top vented recessed wall furnace is
designed to fit in a wall cavity and is vented with a BW
type vent.

BW Vent for Wall Furnaces
BW Vent Design
The BW vent is similar to the B vent, except that it is oval and is designed to fit inside a 2 × 4 stud wall.
The counterflow models are only partially recessed to conceal the vent.
Dual-Wall Models
Dual-wall or double-sided models can heat two separate rooms as they are installed into the wall of the adjacent rooms.

Direct-Vent Wall Furnaces
Combustion Air Source
Direct-vent wall furnaces are constructed so that combustion air comes directly
from outside, and all flue gases discharge into the outside atmosphere.
Installation Flexibility
These appliances normally have an exterior outdoor exposure and can be used in
extremely tight (well-insulated) rooms because combustion air is not affected by
room pressures.
Built-in Grilles
These appliances are complete with grilles to extend the heating surface into the
room.
Air Quality Concerns
Air surrounding the venting, and vent termination(s) is used for combustion and
must be free of any compounds that cause corrosion of internal components.

Wall Furnace Features
Natural Convection
Some direct-vent heaters are designed for natural convection and can operate
without a power supply.
Modulating Fan
Other units may be equipped with a modulating fan for better temperature control.
Smart Controls
Programmable Wi-Fi enabled thermostats allow for remote control and scheduling.
Air Quality Features
Some models include humidifiers and air filters for improved indoor air quality.

Wall Furnace Controls
Basic Controls
The controls for conventional wall furnaces (thermostats
and gas valves) are very basic and similar to room heaters.
Counterflow units have a fan that will be activated by a heat
sensor switch will start the fan once the unit warms up.
Advanced Controls
Units with additional efficiency and accessories will have an
electronic module to control the modulating gas valve,
combustion fan motor, convection fan motor, spark ignition,
and temperature and pressure sensors.

Wall Furnace Venting and Combustion Air
Air Supply Requirements
The appliance must be installed in a location with sufficient
air supply for combustion and venting. The installer must
refer to and comply with CSA B149.1 for minimum sizes and
positions of air supply openings. This air must not be
restricted.
Venting Options
Conventional wall furnaces use B or BW type venting. The
type of vent used must be approved by the manufacturer.
Direct-vent wall furnaces have specialized venting systems
that combine the exhaust and intake functions.

Wall Furnace Installation
Wood Floor Installation
The furnace can be installed directly on a wood floor.
Combustible Floor Protection
When installed on carpeting, tile, or other combustible flooring other than
wood, it must be installed on a metal or wood panel that extends the full
width and depth of the appliance.
Alternative Arrangement
An alternative arrangement includes raising the wall furnace at least 2 inches
(5 cm) above the combustible floor to prevent discoloration and provide
enough clearance.
Safe Placement
The heater must be located to prevent hazard to walls, curtains, furniture,
and doors.

Baseboard Heaters
Applications
Direct-vent baseboard heaters are generally used to supply
supplemental heat to a room, but they can also be used as
the primary source of heat.
Multiple Unit Installation
Depending on the size of the space and the amount of heat
required, a number of baseboard heaters can be wired
together to provide the required output.
The installation, venting, and maintenance of baseboard
heaters follow the manufacturer's certified installation
instructions, codes, and standard procedures outlined for
space heaters.

Wiring of Baseboard Heaters
Thermostat Options
The direct-vent baseboard heater is designed to operate
with a 24 V thermostat.
In retrofit situations, however, it can also be connected to an
existing 120 V thermostat. In this case, the thermostat is
already connected to the 120 V power line and the heater is
wired to the lines from the junction box.
Power Cord Options
Baseboard heaters that come with power cord already
assembled:
•Do not need to be hard-wired
•Can simply be plugged directly into a wall receptacle

Wiring Multiple Baseboard Heaters
Thermostat Limitations
Up to three baseboard heaters may be
controlled from a single thermostat if
all the heaters are in the same room.
Note: No more than three heaters
should be controlled from a single
thermostat.
120V Supply Requirements
If wiring more than one heater from a
120 V supply, all heaters must use the
same circuit.
24V Thermostat Wiring
If wiring more than one heater to a
single 24 V thermostat, do not use
extension cords; the heaters must be
hard-wired in parallel.

Heat Anticipator Settings
Purpose
If using a thermostat with a heat anticipator, it should be set
to the total current draw for the heaters.
Setting Guidelines
Manufacturers provide guidelines for setting the anticipator
based on the number of heaters and their current draw.
The size of the wire is proportional to the distance between
the thermostat and the appliance. A larger gauge of wire has
less resistance, therefore the thermostat can be located
further from the appliance.

Infrared Heaters: Principles
How Infrared Heating Works
Infrared heaters transfer heat directly to people and objects
in their path rather than heating the air. This makes them
efficient for spot heating or in areas with high air exchange
rates.
Advantages
•Instant heat without warm-up time
•Directional heating capability
•Effective in drafty areas
•Energy efficient for spot heating
•No moving parts in many models

Infrared Heaters: Types
High-Intensity
Operate at higher temperatures (1800°F+) and produce more intense infrared
radiation. Often used in outdoor or industrial applications.
Low-Intensity
Operate at lower temperatures and distribute heat more evenly. Common in
residential and commercial spaces.
Tube Heaters
Use a burner to heat a long metal tube that radiates infrared heat. Ideal for large
open spaces like warehouses.
Ceramic Infrared
Use ceramic elements that emit infrared radiation when heated. Often used in more
controlled environments.

Infrared Heaters: Installation
Considerations
Mounting Height
Critical for proper coverage and intensity. Follow manufacturer's
specifications.
Angle and Direction

Construction Heaters: Types
Direct-Fired
Combustion occurs in the open, with all heat and combustion products entering the
space. Requires adequate ventilation. Highest efficiency but limited to well-ventilated
areas.
Indirect-Fired
Combustion occurs in a sealed chamber with heat exchanger. Combustion products
are vented outside. Safer for enclosed spaces but less efficient.
Radiant/Infrared
Heats objects directly rather than the air. Good for spot heating or areas with high air
exchange.
Convection
Heats air that circulates naturally. Often used in smaller enclosed spaces.

All or almost all air for combustion is
supplied as primary air
Short Flames
Flames are short and retained in the
surface of the ceramic
Incandescence
Ceramic surface heats to
incandescence
3
Radiating Screen
Metal screen placed near ceramic
surface also becomes heated to
incandescence
The high operating temperature of the ceramic is desirable because the flame is retained more reliably on the burner surface
and radiating efficiency is improved.

Infrared Heater Applications
Outdoor DiningWarehousesAircraft HangarsLoading DocksGaragesArenasOther
Infrared heaters are used in a variety of applications, with outdoor dining spaces representing the largest segment. They are also commonly installed in large indoor spaces such as warehouses, aircraft
hangars, and public garages where spot heating is required.

Infrared Heater Mounting Heights
The chart shows minimum mounting heights for infrared heaters in different locations. In aircraft hangars, garages, and near exit passageways, heaters must be mounted at least 8 feet above the floor.
For outdoor patios and workshops, a minimum height of 7 feet is typically required, though specific manufacturer requirements may vary.

Ventilation Requirements for Infrared Heaters
The ventilation system for infrared heaters must remove the products of combustion outdoors. The required capacity is 300 cubic feet per minute (CFM) per 100,000 Btu/h of gas input. As shown in the
chart, the ventilation requirements increase linearly with the heater's input rating.

Infrared Heater Surface Temperatures
Low-intensity infrared heaters have a maximum surface temperature of approximately 1200°F (650°C), while high-intensity heaters can reach temperatures as high as 1800°F (980°C). The higher
operating temperature of high-intensity heaters improves radiating efficiency and helps retain the flame more reliably on the burner surface.

Venting Options for Infrared Heaters
Infrared heaters may be vented in one of three ways: unvented (with adequate ventilation), horizontal, or vertical. The chosen
method depends on factors including building ventilation, available access points in walls and ceilings, number of burners
installed, and installation codes.

Horizontal Venting Requirements
3
Minimum Height
Vent terminal must be at least 3 ft above
grade
3
Building Opening Clearance
Vent terminal must be at least 3 ft from any
building opening
6
Combustion Air Separation
Vent must be at least 6 ft from combustion air
opening of this unit or any other appliance
When installing horizontal venting for infrared heaters, these minimum clearances must be
maintained. Additionally, in combustible or non-combustible walls, an insulated vent terminal
must be used, and the vent terminal should be installed at a height sufficient to prevent
blockage by snow.

Vertical Venting Requirements
Vent Type
Type B vent minimum for outdoor use
Thimble Requirement
Insulating thimble for combustible
structures
Horizontal Run Limitation
Maximum 75% of vertical vent height
Common Vent Control
Shared thermostat for common vent
For vertical venting installations, these requirements must be followed to ensure proper and safe operation. The open area of a
common vent must equal the sum of the open areas of individual vents connected to it, and connections must be positioned to
avoid direct opposition between streams of combustion gases.

Troubleshooting Flash Back in High-Intensity Heaters
Identify the Problem
Flash back produces a loud ignition noise followed by a hissing sound with no visible burning on the ceramic tile
Immediate Action
Turn off the heater immediately if flash back occurs during operation
Check for Causes

CSA Unit 21
Chapter 2   Gas Fireplaces:
Types, Venting, and
Controls
Gas fireplaces are popular additions to homes, providing both ambience
and supplemental heating. This presentation explores the different types
of gas fireplaces, their venting requirements, control systems, and
installation considerations to ensure safe and efficient operation.

Purpose of Gas Fireplaces
Decorative Gas Fireplaces
Typically not designed for efficiency or intended for use as
heaters
Used to add atmosphere and ambience to a room
Will not have a thermostat
Heating Gas Fireplaces
Also known as vented gas fireplace heaters
Have higher efficiency ratings
Include additional temperature controls
Designed to provide supplemental zone heating

Important Safety Considerations
Certification
Check that the gas fireplace is certified by the CSA Group or other certifying
agency
Follow Instructions
Read all product specifications and instructions to ensure maximum benefits
and safety
Vent-Free Caution
Vent-free gas fireplaces are not approved for use in Canada due to serious
indoor air-quality and moisture problems
Code Compliance
Gas fireplaces must be installed according to CSA B149.1, national and provincial
building codes, and electrical codes

Energy Efficiency Considerations
EnerGuide Rating
The EnerGuide label displays the
model's Fireplace Efficiency (FE) as a
percentage
Models on the market have FE's
ranging from 30% to 70%
Heating Efficiency
An efficient gas fireplace can lower a
home's overall energy consumption
when located in a major living area
Heating gas fireplaces must have a
minimum FE of 50% as per CAN/CSA
P.4.1
Primary vs. Secondary Heat
In a large space with multiple rooms, a
gas fireplace is not an efficient primary
heating source
An energy-efficient furnace is usually
a better choice for primary heating

Venting Requirements
Direct Venting
Preferred configuration for all modern gas fireplaces
Natural Draft
May be used for replacement of existing natural draft vented gas fireplaces
Fireplace Inserts
May be installed in masonry chimney with manufacturer's
recommended flue liner
For safety reasons, direct venting is the preferred configuration for all modern gas fireplaces. This system provides a sealed combustion
chamber that draws air from outside and vents exhaust gases directly outdoors. Natural draft gas fireplaces may be used for
replacement of existing natural draft vented gas fireplaces, but are not recommended for new installations.

Masonry Chimney Considerations
Do
•Inspect the masonry chimney before installing the unit
•Make sure the chimney's clay flue liner is not cracked,
soft, or spalled
•Ensure mortar joints between liner sections are in place
and tight
•Clean creosote from the top, sides, and back of a
masonry firebox
•Check whether local codes require the fireplace damper
to be clamped open or removed
Do Not
•Share a gas-fired appliance flue with a wood-burning
appliance
•Allow products of combustion from a decorative
fireplace to enter an existing masonry chimney without
proper modifications
•Install in a chimney vulnerable to flue gas condensation
and inadequate draft

Installation Requirements
Bathroom Installation
Gas fireplace installations in a bathroom are only allowed if it is a direct-
vent type
Bedroom Installation
Installation in a bedroom or bed-sitting room is only permitted if the
appliance rating plate states "also certified for installation in a bedroom
or bed-sitting room"
Certification
Must conform to both Clause 7.24 and 7.25 of CSA B149.1
Clearances
Must maintain proper clearances from combustible materials as
specified by manufacturer

Flame Characteristics
Traditional Design
Originally, gas fireplaces were not designed to produce an
efficient flame, but rather to emulate a wood fire
The primary concern was to have flame characteristics that
are tall, yellow, and flickering
Modern Options
With added convenience, cleanliness, and increased
efficiency, gas fireplaces have become very popular
There are now many different flame styles available to suit
the user's taste
Modern designs balance aesthetics with efficiency

Types of Burners: Tube Burner
Construction
The burner consists of a steel tube,
closed at one end, and an air shutter
at the other end
The tube may be a variety of
configurations: straight, U-shaped, H-
shaped, or S-shaped
Ports
Ports of different sizes are drilled or
punched in the tube at different
locations and in different patterns
Clusters of larger ports are where the
majority of the flame will be
Small, single rows of ports between
the larger clusters are called carry-
over ports
Air Shutter
The air shutter draws primary air into the burner and mixes it with the gas
Manufacturers adjust the air shutters to their proper position and usually fix that
position

Types of Burners: Box Burner
Construction
Box burners are made of sheet metal that is slotted or punched to form ports and
then bent into a box shape
Design Features
The holes and slots can be arranged to give a specific flame pattern
The burner may have pins on the top to help position the simulated logs
Gas-Tight Seams
After it is bent into a box shape, the box seams are made to be gas-tight
Air Mixture
Like a tube burner, a box burner has an air shutter attached to it, or a separate
venturi tube and air shutter can be connected to the box

Types of Burners: Ceramic Tile Burner
Construction
Ceramic tile burners consist of a ceramic tile mounted in a sheet metal box
The ceramic tile has many small ports arranged in a very uniform pattern
The box holds the ceramic tile and provides a space into which the gas and primary air
mixture flow
Key Differences
The ceramic tile is brittle and can crack
Bending or prying the ceramic burner can cause gas to leak around the ceramic tile
Gas leaks can change the flame appearance and could make the gas appliance unsafe to
use

Pilot Burner Assemblies
Continuous Pilot
Also known as standing pilot
Energizes the millivolt control system
Can increase energy costs
Advantage of operating as an auxiliary heat source not dependent on
electricity
Most provinces have adopted energy efficiency standards that ban the sale of
continuous pilot fireplaces
Intermittent Pilot
Automatically ignited when the fireplace is called on to operate
Extinguished when the main burner operating cycle is complete
Modern electronic burner controls can operate on low DC voltage
Can use common dry cell batteries as backup or main power source
Provides the same auxiliary heat benefit as continuous pilot models

Types of Gas Fireplaces
Gas Fireplace Inserts
Convert existing wood-burning
masonry or factory-built fireplaces to
gas
Zero-Clearance Gas
Fireplaces
Used in installations where there's no
existing fireplace
Free-Standing Gas Fireplaces
Resemble wood-burning stoves and
often referred to as gas stoves
Gas Log Sets
Strictly classified as decorative

Energy Efficiency Requirements
Efficiency Standards
Decorative gas fireplaces do not have a minimum efficiency
requirement
Heating gas fireplaces must have a minimum FE of 50% as per
CAN/CSA P.4.1
Pilot Light Requirements
As of January 1, 2010, for new installations, gas fireplaces must
have one of several pilot flame control mechanisms
Venting Requirements
Must have a direct vent configuration, unless marked for
replacement use only

Gas Log Sets
Design
A gas flame provided by a bar-
type burner is placed under an
arrangement of ceramic logs
As the flame plays over the logs,
it is luminous due to the
disturbance in flame pattern
caused by the logs
Closely approximates a wood
flame in appearance
Installation Requirements
Must be installed only in a vented,
wood-burning fireplace with a
working flue
Fireplace must be constructed of
non-combustible material
The fireplace damper must be
locked fully open when gas logs
are installed
Limitations
Provide no real heat to the house
Can cause venting system problems, particularly in colder regions

Gas Log Maintenance
Inspect
Visually inspect the gas line and connections
Protect
Cover the pilot burner with a plastic bag to prevent material from
falling into the burner and orifices
Clean
Clean the logs of soot deposits
Check
Check the pilot burner to make sure it is clear of obstructions
Caution! Do not handle logs until they have cooled.

Gas Fireplace Inserts
Purpose
Used to convert existing
wood-burning masonry or
factory-built fireplaces to
gas
Once converted, the
fireplace can no longer be
used to burn solid fuel
Design
Gas burner and simulated
logs are contained in a
special metal housing
(engine) that fits into the
existing fireplace cavity
Some designs extend part
of the heat exchange
surface into the heating
space for radiant heat
Caution
Do not insulate around the fireplace insert as it results in
overheating and possible malfunction of the circulating fan

Combustion Air for Fireplace Inserts
Natural Draft Type
Designed to draw air in from the front and outer perimeters
of the fireplace
This air provides:
•Combustion air
•Dilution air for proper venting
•Air heated over the heat exchanger
It is very important that an adequate air supply be available
Direct-Vent Units
Preferred for new, tightly sealed and insulated homes
Have a dedicated combustion air supply duct from the
outside
Provide better efficiency and safety
Required for installation in R-2000 homes

Zero-Clearance Gas Fireplaces
Application
Used in installations where there's no
existing fireplace
Usually installed during construction
of new homes or renovation of
existing homes
Installation Flexibility
Can be built into a wall, a corner, a
peninsula, or even an island in the
home
Involves building the space and
framing in the unit
Important Considerations
Manufacturer's instructions must be followed carefully
Ensure proper clearances from combustibles
Use only approved venting materials
Caution! The glass used with these fireplaces is a special, high-temperature, ceramic
glass. If glass is damaged it should be replaced with a complete glass and frame
assembly purchased from an authorized dealer. Substituting lower grade glass could
cause injury or property damage.

Free-Standing Gas

Typically resemble wood-
burning stoves and
therefore are often referred
to as gas stoves
Heat Efficiency
Tend to be effective in
supplying heat to the
house, since all of the
fireplace's surfaces are
exposed to the room
Installation
Usually require no framing construction
Some units may require the installation of insulating materials to
protect combustible walls and floors from high temperatures

Venting Options for Gas Fireplaces
Natural Draft Venting
Uses a vertical chimney to take
advantage of the fact that hot air
rises
Direct Venting
Outdoor combustion air is drawn directly
into the firebox through one pipe, while
combustion products are exhausted
through another
Power Venting
Uses an electrical fan to assist the
venting process
Caution! Vent-free gas fireplaces offer no venting capacity. This means that harmful combustion by-products, including
possible deadly carbon monoxide, are released directly into a home. These units are not only unacceptable and uncertified for
Canadian housing, but they can be dangerous.

Natural Draft Venting
Operation
Uses a vertical chimney to take
advantage of the fact that hot air
rises
Creates a natural draft of hot
combustion gases up the flue to the
outdoors
Requires a draft hood that uses
house air to isolate the burner from
outside pressure fluctuations
Components
Typically uses a B-vent or, in an
existing chimney, an approved
metal liner
May include a B-vent or a flexible
metal liner
Considerations
Less efficient than direct venting as it uses heated indoor air
Requires proper chimney height and draft

Natural Draft Venting Installation
1
Transition Hardware
Manufacturers supply the vent
hardware to transition from the
fireplace insert's flue collar
through the existing fireplace
damper
2
Relining System
Manufacturers may require or
recommend a vent relining
system for many existing
fireplace vent systems
3
Code Compliance
The venting system must be
installed in accordance with CSA
B149.1
4
Clearances
Minimum clearances to combustible materials are 1
inch (2.5 cm) for B vents and 6 inches (15 cm) for
single-wall vents
5
Vent Cap Height
The vent cap must always extend a minimum of 2 ft
(60 cm) above any structure within a 10 ft (3 m)
horizontal plane

Direct Venting
Key Benefits
The sealed firebox generally makes these units safer since they require no room air for combustion
The units are more energy-efficient because there is no loss of heated room air out the vent
Direct-vent fireplaces are typically installed on an outside wall, with the vent running directly through
the wall
Some models are approved for extended horizontal and vertical flues
R-2000 Homes
To be installed in an energy-efficient R-2000 home, a gas fireplace must be direct-vented (sealed)
This provides an additional level of protection against spillage of combustion products
Helps increase the appliance's efficiency
Essential for modern, tightly-sealed homes

Types of Direct Venting
Coaxial Venting
Uses two concentric pipes
The outer pipe brings combustion air in from the outdoors
The inner pipe exhausts the combustion products
This is the method commonly used for sidewall venting
Collinear Venting
Uses two completely separate pipes to:
•Supply outside combustion air
•Exhaust combustion products
Most often used where there are space limitations when an existing fireplace and chimney have been retrofitted with a gas
insert
Used where long vent distances and cold temperatures make condensation and vent icing a potential concern

Power Venting Applications
Operation
Uses an electrical fan to assist the venting process
Installation Flexibility
Allows units to be installed with longer horizontal runs
Can be used in areas of a home where a conventional flue cannot be used
Approval
The power vent kit must be approved for the specific fireplace
Safety Interlock
The power vent fan kit must be interlocked with the fireplace controls
Ensures that the fireplace cannot light unless the power vent is
functioning

Vent Installation Considerations
Follow Instructions Exactly
One of the most important parts of the installation
Multiple Venting Options
A single model may have several approved configurations
Use Diagrams and Charts
Follow manufacturer's venting instructions and flow charts

Natural draft B-vent
Compatibility
Different venting manufacturer's components must not be combined

Vent Length Considerations
Vent Length Graphs
Manufacturers provide graphs
for selecting an acceptable
combination of horizontal and
vertical vent lengths
These must be followed
precisely for proper operation
Slope Requirements
Horizontal runs must slope
upward a minimum of 1/4 inch
per foot, or 1 in 50
Vent Restrictor
Installations with vertical rise may require the installation or
adjustment of a vent restrictor
