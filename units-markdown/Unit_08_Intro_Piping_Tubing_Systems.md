Type II Hose
Maximum operating pressure: 350 psig (2.4
MPa)
Minimum burst pressure: Ranges from 1750 psig
to 12,000 psig depending on size
Has a tubing made of oil-resistant elastomer
with cotton or synthetic braided cover

MPa)
Minimum burst pressure: Ranges from 1750 psig
to 12,000 psig depending on size
Has a tube or lining made of oil-resistant
material with low permeability
All elastomeric hose types must comply with CAN/CGA-8.1 and have certification and marking indicating type, maximum working pressure of 350
psig (2400 kPa), and a date code.

Thermoplastic Hose and Flexible Connectors
Thermoplastic Hose
Thermoplastic hose has a minimum working pressure of 350
psig (2.4 MPa) and a minimum burst strength of five times
the rated working pressure. It has an inner tube made of
seamless thermoplastic with tube reinforcement consisting
of one or more plies of synthetic fiber or stainless-steel wire.
The outer surface of the hose is weather resistant. This hose
must have certification of compliance with CAN1-8.3.
Markings include the symbol of the certification agency,
hose ID size, date code, and maximum working pressure.
Flexible Connectors
Flexible connectors approved for use with natural gas and
propane must conform to ANSI Z21.69/CSA 6.16,
Connectors for movable gas appliances. They are for use
with:
•Gas-fired commercial cooking equipment mounted on
casters
•Equipment that may need to be moved for cleaning
•Other large, heavy gas-fired equipment that may need to
be moved
They are for use with piping systems having fuel gas
pressures not in excess of 0.5 psig (3.4 kPa) and are not
more than 6 ft (1.83 m) in nominal length.

Corrugated Metal Connectors
Construction
Corrugated metal connectors are
made of new, unused parts and
materials, consisting of corrugated
tubing. They have nominal internal
diameters of 1/4, 3/8, 1/2, 5/8, 3/4,
and 1 in.
Fittings
They have fittings at both ends
provided with tapered pipe threads
for connection to gas appliances
and to house piping.
Approval
Corrugated metal connectors that
have approval for use with natural
gas and propane must conform to
ANSI Z21.69/CSA 6.16.

Pipe Joining Sealants
Effective Sealant
Requirements
To be effective, a joint sealant must:
•Flow to match the piping surfaces
and seal tightly
•Be non-hardening
•Withstand the required
temperatures and pressures
•Not be corroded by, or leach into,
the piping contents
•Prevent rusting and corrosion
•Lubricate when necessary
Certification Requirements
Sealants used with gas piping systems
must receive certification for such use
from one of the following agencies:
•Underwriters' Laboratories of
Canada
•CSA Group
The sealant container will bear a label
stating the name of the agency and
that the material is a Listed Joint
Compound.
Types of Joint Sealants
Joint sealants include:
•Thread compound (commonly called "pipe dope")
•Approved Teflon pipe tape

Applying Joint Sealants
Apply to Male Threads Only
Pipe dope and pipe tape help seal joints
in piping systems. Apply them only to
the male threads of pipes and fittings.
Using them on female threads may
cause an obstruction to flow, as they
may be forced into the pipe.
Leave First Threads Free
Leave the first two threads of pipes and
fittings free of dope or tape to prevent
the sealant from entering the piping
system and potentially damaging gas
valves and components downstream.
Apply Pipe Dope Evenly
Apply the pipe dope evenly to all but
the first two threads, with sufficient
coverage to seal the joint. Pipe dope
also acts as a lubricant, helping keep
temperatures down and reducing the
amount of wrench needed to run up the
threads.
Apply Pipe Tape Correctly
Stretch and apply the pipe tape to the
pipe in a clockwise direction, with a
50% overlap between wraps. Only
grades of Teflon pipe tape that are
identified by their listing as "Approved
for Gas" and often manufactured in a
different color such as orange or red are
approved for use with natural gas and
propane.

Expansion and Contraction in Piping
Systems
Temperature Fluctuations
In locations that experience wide fluctuations in temperature, piping installations must be able to
accommodate expansion and contraction.
Accommodation Methods
This can be accomplished through:
•Expansion loops
•Offsets
•Swing joints
Purpose
These types of piping configurations allow a system to stress and flex at fitting joints rather than
experience a break of pipe or fitting when piping settles or moves.
Securing Piping
Anchor or secure piping at critical points in order to control the direction of expansion and contraction.

Hazardous Locations for Gas
Piping
Prohibited Locations
You cannot install gas piping and tubing in locations where you can expect
diffusion of the gas throughout the building if a gas leak occurred. This
includes areas such as:
•Stairwells of multi-Chapter dwellings (more than two Chapters)
•Heating and ventilation ducts
•Elevator shafts
•Dumb waiters
•Chimneys
Corrosive Environments
You cannot install gas piping and tubing in locations where:
•Large quantities of corrosive chemicals are used
•It is in contact with corrosive cinders

Underground Gas Piping Requirements
Minimum Size
Piping cannot be smaller than NPS 1/2.
Depth Requirements
Minimum depth of installation must be:
•24 in (600 mm) under commercial driveways or parking lots
•15 in (400 mm) in other locations
Placement Restrictions
It must not pass beneath foundations, walls, or buildings.
Corrosion Protection
Except for Type K copper, it must have an approved, corrosion-resistant coating or covering.
Joint Requirements
All piping joints must be welded or be approved compression fittings. All copper tubing joints and connections must be brazed.

Runs Between Buildings and Copper Protection
Runs Between Buildings
Gas piping and tubing run between buildings must have a
shut-off valve where it exits the first building and one at the
point where it enters the second.
This ensures that gas flow can be stopped at either end of
the run in case of emergency or for maintenance purposes.
Protection of Copper Tubing
Where copper tubing runs through concrete, cement block
walls, or in places where contact with another surface could
cause corrosion of the pipe, the pipe must have external
corrosion protection in the form of:
•Paint
•Anti-corrosion coating
•Double layer of certified protective tape
Copper tubing used in underground applications must be
either Type G or Type L with an external approved coating,
or Type K.

Rooftop Piping Considerations
Support Requirements
When installing piping on commercial rooftops, give special considerations to support
along the piping length and at threaded connections.
Corrosion Protection
Ensure that piping exposed to the elements has protection against corrosion and linear
expansion.
Expansion Provisions
When a rooftop piping run extends beyond 100 feet in straight length, provide
provisions for linear expansion in the form of piping offsets or engineered expansion
joints.
Stress Management
These piping techniques take the stress of expansion away from the rigid piping length,
preventing potential leaks or failures.

Indoor Gas Piping Requirements
1
Minimum Pipe Size
The minimum pipe size for indoor applications is 1/2 in
diameter; however, 3/8 in diameter tubing may be
used for branch lines that are 25 ft (7.5 m) or less in
length and that do not supply more than 15,000 Btu/h
(4.5 kW).
2
Piping Orientation
Gas system piping and tubing can run parallel,
diagonal, or at right angles to floor joists, with specific
mounting requirements for each orientation.
3
Parallel Runs
When running pipe or tubing parallel to joists, fasten it
to the center of the vertical face of the joist.
4
Diagonal or Perpendicular Runs
When running pipe or tubing diagonally or at right
angles to joists, fasten it to the bottom of the joist or
install it through holes drilled in the center of the joists.

Piping and Joist Orientation
Parallel to Joists
When gas piping runs parallel to floor
joists, it must be fastened to the center
of the vertical face of the joist for proper
support and protection.
Perpendicular to Joists
When gas piping runs at right angles to
joists, it can be installed through holes
drilled in the center of the joists,
providing a clean installation that
doesn't interfere with finishing
materials.
Attached to Bottom of Joists
When running diagonally or at right
angles to joists, piping can also be
fastened to the bottom of the joists,
preferably close to water pipes,
conduits, ductwork, or support beams.

Concealed Piping Requirements
Location Restrictions
Concealed gas piping and tubing must not be in a
location where an undetected leak could allow gas to
accumulate.
Testing Requirements
It must undergo testing and inspection in the final
location before you conceal it.
Joint Restrictions
It should not have unions or swing joints made up of a
combination of fittings.
Size Limitations
You may not conceal gas piping less than NPS 1/2.

Tubing in Framed Walls
Protection Requirements
Copper tubing installed in framed walls must have a metal sleeve or other similar
means of protection at the point where it passes through a sill plate or other
structural members.
The protective sleeve must project at least 4 in (10 cm) on either side of the structural
member.
It must also have sufficient slack to allow for expansion, contraction, and some
movement.
When tubing runs horizontally across studs notched to accommodate the tubing, it
must be protected where it crosses each stud by a 16-gauge (USG) steel plate
extending at least 2 in (5 cm) on either side of the tubing.
Notches cut into studs must be large enough to accommodate the tubing without
forcing, but not so large as to weaken the stud.

In-Floor Gas Piping Installations
Channel with Removable Cover
When installed in concrete or other
solid types of floor, gas piping and
tubing can be located in a channel or
chase with a removable, protective
access cover.
Ventilated Sleeve
Another approved method for in-floor
installations is placing the gas piping in
a ventilated sleeve under the floor,
which allows for inspection and
prevents gas accumulation in case of
leaks.
Vertical Pipe Chase
When gas piping or tubing is installed in
a vertical pipe chase, the pipe chase
must have openings with a minimum
area equivalent to a 1 in diameter hole at
each end to provide ventilation.

Dirt and Drip Pockets
Purpose and Construction
A dirt pocket (sometimes called a dust pocket) is an area in a piping system that collects dirt and from which you can remove the dirt. A
drip pocket is an area in a piping system that collects condensate and from which you can remove the condensate.
A dirt or drip pocket is made from a "T" fitting, short nipple, and a cap. Its size makes the depth of the pocket either 3 in (75 mm) or equal
to the internal diameter of the piping it serves, whichever is greater.
Typical dirt pocket installation
Dirt and drip pocket sizing requirements

Dirt and Drip Pocket
Applications
Installation Location
Install a dirt pocket at the
bottom of any piping or
tubing on the final drop
serving most appliances.
Some specific appliances
do not require dirt pockets
(see Clause 6.13.1 of CSA
B149.1).
Condensation
Collection
A piping system where
condensation may collect,
as may be a result of the
piping being exposed to
wide ranges or sudden
change in temperature,
must have a drip pocket.
Sizing Requirements
The diameter of the pocket is either NPS 2 or equal to the
diameter of the piping it serves, whichever is less.

Prohibited Piping Practices
Nesting of Bushings
The relatively thin walls of bushings can
easily lead to fractures when a nest of
bushings is tightened. The likelihood of
leakage when a number of bushings are
nested is also significantly higher.
Mixed Thread Directions
Fittings containing both left- and right-
hand threads are susceptible to the
loosening of one end when the other is
being tightened.
Thread Protectors and Running
Threads
These do not allow for proper seating
and thread lock-up, thereby increasing
the likelihood of leakage.
Concealed Swing Joints
Since swing joints are susceptible to
loosening at the joints over time, you
cannot install them in concealed
locations.
Field Bending of Pipe
This is prohibited because it may induce
stresses that can lead to rupture and
leakage.

More Prohibited Practices
Electrical Grounding
You cannot use piping or tubing
as a ground because it does not
comply with the applicable
requirements of the Canadian
Electrical Code and may
potentially result in an electrical
hazard. Bonding of piping or
tubing is permitted; however,
when doing this, you must
connect the bond to an
approved electrical ground.
Close Nipples
Close nipples do not have a
shoulder, resulting in a lack of
seating that can lead to leakage.
Street Elbows and Tees
Street elbows and tees are not
permitted because these fittings
have both male and female
threaded ends. This makes
alignment of the piping difficult
since the direction of the piping
does not always correspond with
the fully seated position of the
fitting. When you back off the
connection to align the piping,
leakage may result.

Gas Tubing Fittings
Approved Fittings
You may connect copper and other tubing with forged,
brass, 45° flare fittings as well as approved compression
fittings such as SWAGELOK®. Note that although there are
many types and manufacturers of compression fittings, not
all are approved.
You can make connections between tubing and steel pipe by
means of threaded-to-tubing adaptors.
Never use tubing fittings for pressures higher than those
that local codes permit.
Approved tubing fittings: (a) 45° flare fitting and (b)
SWAGELOK® compression fitting

Steel Piping and Tubing
Fittings
Construction Requirements
Steel pipe fittings must be of malleable iron or steel construction and have
approval for use with gas systems.
Common Types
Steel pipe fittings consist of:
•45° and 90° elbows
•Straight and reducing couplings
•Nipples and unions
•Bushings
•Normal and reducing tees
•Plugs and caps

Common Steel Gas System Fittings
Steel gas system fittings include 90° elbows, reducing tees, plugs, bushings, reducing couplings, standard couplings, tees, and unions. Each has a specific purpose in creating
gas distribution systems.

Prohibited Fittings
Close Nipple
Close nipples do not have a shoulder,
resulting in a lack of seating that can
lead to leakage. They are prohibited for
use in gas systems.
Street Elbow
Street elbows have both male and
female threaded ends, making
alignment difficult. When you back off
the connection to align the piping,
leakage may result.
Running Threads
Fittings with running threads do not
allow for proper seating and thread
lock-up, thereby increasing the
likelihood of leakage in gas systems.

Gas Valves Overview
Purpose
Gas valves control the flow of gas to different appliances and to
main and pilot burners at various points along a piping system.
With different valves, the gas technician/fitter can make a
complete shutdown or regulate the flow at a specific location.
Selection Factors
The gas technician/fitter must take care in selecting the correct
valve for the job, since valve size, gas pressure, and location are all
important factors for consideration.
Installation Considerations
The gas technician/fitter must also allow for the valve's removal for
repair or replacement.
Code Requirements
CSA B149.1 outlines specific locations and applications for
installing manual gas valves in Clause 6.18.

Manual Gas Shut-Off Valves
Installation Methods
Manual gas valves are incorporated into the piping system in
different ways. In most cases, the size of the valve dictates the
jointing method used:
•Larger valves are usually flanged in place
•Mid-range sizes are threaded
•Smaller sizes, when used with copper tubing, are connected
using flare fittings
Valve Categories
Manual gas shut off valves fall into three categories:
•Plug type
•Ball type
•Eccentric type

Plug Type Valves
Operation
Plug type valves fully open or close with a quarter turn of a handle.
Types
There are two basic types common to the gas industry:
1.Spring-loaded valve - Made of brass and approved only for indoor use with sizes reaching up to 1 in diameter
2.Lubricated plug valve - Made of malleable iron and approved for indoor or outdoor use. Commonly named Lubeseal. Designed to
be lubricated and maintained with the valve in place and with no interruption of service
For outdoor use, you may also obtain the lubricated plug valve with a removable handle and a locking accessory for security.
Lubricated plug valve for gas systems
Spring-loaded gas valve for indoor use

Eccentric and Ball Valves
Eccentric Valve
The rotating-eccentric valve has a spherically faced plug that rotates through approximately 50° from the fully-open to fully-closed position. The eccentric motion
of the plug reduces operating torque requirements and produces no sliding friction between the plug and seat, reducing seat wear and seating torque.
Ball Valve
Ball-type valves also open and close with a quarter turn of a handle and have approval for indoor or outdoor use. They have a Teflon seat and a stainless-steel
sealing ball. To control the flow, the ball has a hole drilled through its center and fits tightly against the Teflon seat in the closed position.
Needle Valve
Needle valves are used for smaller applications and internal valve control. They are simple restrictors of flow, which you usually open or close with a screwdriver.
When slightly unscrewed, flow is limited. Full flow occurs when the needle is screwed out to its fullest extent.

Master Shut-Off Valves
Code Requirements
Clause 6.18.10 of CSA B149.1 contains the Code requirements for master shut-off valves.
Multiple Outlets
According to the Code, when multiple outlets are installed in a classroom, laboratory, or
similar facility, a clearly identified master shut-off valve must control them.
Location
The master shut-off valve must be located within the room containing the multiple
outlets.
Identification
The master shut-off valve must be clearly identified to ensure it can be quickly located
in case of emergency.

Polyethylene Pipe Joining Process
Preparation
Cut pipe ends square and ensure that surfaces you will join
are properly aligned.
Cleaning
Remove water, dirt, grease, oil, fingerprints, and cuttings.
Wipe the inside and outside of the pipes with a clean, lint-
free cloth.
Temperature Setting
Set the thermoswitch to 500°F ± 7°F (260°C ± 4°C). Allow
the temperature to stabilize, then check with a tempilstik.
Heating
Apply the heating iron to the surface of the mating
components until each surface melts but does not burn.
Joining
Remove the heating irons and press the surfaces together
with the appropriate pressure until the joint cools and
solidifies.

Flexible Connector Requirements
Certification
Must conform to ANSI Z21.69/CSA 6.16

Copper Tubing Protection in Walls
Metal Sleeve Protection
Required where tubing passes through structural members
Steel Plate Guards
16-gauge plates protect tubing crossing studs
Proper Notching
Notches must accommodate tubing without forcing
Expansion Allowance
Sufficient slack for expansion and contraction

Pipe Joining Sealant Application
Select Approved
Sealant
Use only pipe dope or Teflon
pipe tape that is specifically
approved for gas
applications. Approved
Teflon pipe tape is often
manufactured in a different
color such as orange or red.
Prepare the Threads
Ensure threads are clean and
free from debris before
applying sealant. Dirty
threads can prevent proper
sealing even with the correct
sealant.
Apply to Male Threads
Only
Apply sealant only to the
male threads, leaving the
first two threads free of dope
or tape to prevent the
sealant from entering the
piping system.
Apply Tape Correctly
When using tape, stretch
and apply it to the pipe in a
clockwise direction, with a
50% overlap between wraps
to ensure complete
coverage and effective
sealing.

Gas Valve Selection Guide
Ball ValvesPlug ValvesEccentric ValvesNeedle ValvesOther Valve Types
The chart shows the distribution of valve types used in gas systems. Ball valves are the most commonly used at 45%, followed by plug valves at 30%. Eccentric valves account for 15% of installations, while needle
valves and other specialized valve types each represent 5% of the market. The selection depends on factors such as application, pressure rating, location, and maintenance requirements.

Piping Material Comparison
CostInstallation TimeDurability
This chart compares different gas piping materials across three key metrics: cost (higher values indicate higher cost), installation time (higher values indicate longer installation time), and durability (higher values indicate
greater durability). Steel pipe offers the highest durability but requires the longest installation time. CSST has the highest material cost but the fastest installation time. Polyethylene provides the lowest cost option but
with somewhat lower durability ratings compared to metallic options.

Pipe Threading and Joining Methods
NPT Threading
Gas piping utilizes a tapered thread
(NPT) cut on a pipe threading machine
or hand tool. The taper allows threads to
form a seal when torqued as the flanks
compress against each other.
Copper Flaring
Copper tubing is joined using 45° brass
flare connectors. The flaring tool
creates a precise angle that mates with
the fitting to create a gas-tight seal.
Polyethylene Fusion
Polyethylene piping is fused by applying
heat and pressure. As the surfaces melt,
the heating irons are removed and the
surfaces are pressed together to form a
strong joint.

Gas System Installation Safety
Material Verification
Ensure all materials are approved for gas applications and have proper certification markings.
Pressure Testing
Test all piping and tubing in the final location before concealing it to verify there are no leaks.
Proper Ventilation
Install gas piping in ventilated spaces and never in locations where leaking gas could accumulate.
Physical Protection
Protect piping from physical damage with proper sleeves, plates, and support methods.
Accessible Shut-offs
Install shut-off valves in accessible locations to allow quick gas isolation in emergencies.

Dirt Pocket Installation
Purpose of Dirt Pockets
Dirt pockets (sometimes called dust pockets) collect dirt and debris from the gas
system, preventing it from reaching and potentially damaging appliance components.
They are installed at the bottom of any piping or tubing on the final drop serving most
appliances.
The design allows solid particles to fall into the pocket rather than continuing to the
appliance. The cap at the bottom can be removed for periodic cleaning to maintain
system efficiency and safety.
A typical dirt pocket installation consists of a "T" fitting, short nipple, and a cap. The
depth of the pocket is either 3 in (75 mm) or equal to the internal diameter of the piping it
serves, whichever is greater. The diameter is either NPS 2 or equal to the diameter of the
piping it serves, whichever is less.

Piping System Maintenance
Regular Inspection
Periodically check piping systems for
signs of corrosion, damage, or leaks.
Clean Dirt Pockets
Remove and clean dirt pockets to
prevent debris accumulation in the
system.
Leak Testing
Perform leak tests after any system
modifications or repairs.
Valve Maintenance
Lubricate and service valves
according to manufacturer
specifications.
Check Supports
Verify that pipe supports remain
secure and properly positioned.

Code Compliance and Certification
CSA B149.1 Requirements

outlines the proper connecting methods and the many piping practices that gas
technicians/fitters must follow.
Material Certification
All piping, tubing, valves, and fittings used in gas systems must have proper certification
from recognized agencies such as CSA Group or Underwriters' Laboratories of Canada.
Installer Certification
Gas technicians/fitters should ensure they have successfully completed manufacturer's
certified installation training programs, especially for specialized systems like
polyethylene piping or CSST.
Inspection Requirements

If the valve passes gas in this way, the system test will not be
accurate and results will be invalid

Shut-Off Valve Seepage Test
Procedure
Create Static Pressure
When the system is brought to a static pressure condition, release a small
amount of the contained gas pressure
Quick Release Method
Quickly remove, then replace, the manometer or pressure gauge tubing
Test Service Regulator
This action opens the service regulator, allowing the testing of the
system back to the gas meter shut-off valve
Observe Pressure
If, after this action, the gas pressure increases slowly to static
pressure, the meter valve is seeping gas and should undergo
servicing before testing proceeds

Propane System Testing Overview
Two-Stage Testing
Propane system testing is also in two stages:
1.Before the installation of appliances
2.After installation of appliances
Before Appliance Installation
This is the same procedure as for natural gas.
Refer to Testing before installation of appliances section.

Propane System Testing After Appliance
Installation
With Meter
If a meter is installed on the propane
system, this test follows the same
procedure as natural gas
Without Meter
If no meter is installed, perform a
main manual shut-off valve seepage
test
Pressure Testing
Place a pressure gauge on the system
according to CSA B149.1
requirements
System Verification
Pressurize the system and observe
for leakage

Two-Stage Propane System Testing
Place Pressure Gauges
Place another pressure gauge on the second stage. You can use a manometer in place of a pressure gauge on low-
pressure systems
Seepage Test
Perform a seepage test on the manual shut-off valve at the second-stage regulator
Pressurize System
Pressurize the system by opening the manual valves on each stage
Close Valves
When the system is up to pressure, close the manual valves
Monitor Pressure
Mark the pressure gauges and observe for leakage

Propane System Leak
Detection
Identify Pressure Drop
If a drop in pressure in the system indicates a leak
Apply Soap Solution
Wipe each joint or fitting in the suspect portion of the
system with the leak detector solution (soap and water)
Locate Leak Source
A leak will cause the solution to form bubbles at its source

Safety and Procedures
A comprehensive guide for gas technicians and fitters on how to properly
purge gas piping systems in accordance with applicable codes to prevent
combustible air/gas mixtures and ensure air-free gas delivery to
appliances.

Purpose and Objectives
Purpose
A gas technician/fitter must know how to properly purge a
gas piping system in accordance with applicable codes to
prevent a buildup of combustible air/gas mixtures and
ensure that the pinng/ tubing system delivers air-free gas to
the appliances.

Learning Objectives
Refer to Code Requirements
Understand and apply Code
requirements related to purging gas
systems
Identify Purge Points
Correctly identify appropriate
locations for purge points in gas
systems
Differentiate Gas Types
Describe differences in purging natural gas and propane systems

Key Terminology
Branch line
Part of a piping or tubing system that conveys gas from the main piping or tubing or header to an
appliance(s)
Purge
To replace the existing fluid (gaseous or liquid) in piping, tubing, equipment, a container, or an
appliance with a desired fluid
Purge burner
Burner equipped with a constant ignition source and a flame arrestor intended to burn the escaping
(discharged) gas during purging operations
Specific gravity
Ratio of the density of the gas to the density of the air at a specified temperature and pressure

Purging Requirements Overview
After successfully completing pressure and leak tests, you
must purge the gas system. Purging consists of forcing air
out of the system with gas under pressure. It is important to
begin and perform purging at the proper locations to ensure
the complete system is purged.
Clause 6 of CSA B149.1 covers purging requirements and
procedures.
Incorrect purging methods and shortcuts have led to
numerous leaks, fires, and even explosions. lt is imperative
that gas technicians have louts hare four even explosion in
the skills. It is imperative that gas technicians/fitters
maintain safe and approved purging meth work conducted.

Purge Points and Procedures
Start at the Farthest Point
Purging should begin at the appliance farthest from the source of supply.
Purge Branch Lines
Purging of branch lines then follows one by one at a location farthest from the
source on supply.
Complete Individual Lines
Furging lines includual branch line.
Clause 6.23 of CSA B149.1 lists a number of different options for purging natural gas and
propane piping and tubing systems. You should review these options to ensure that you
use the most suitable method for the type of installation at hand.
Incorrect purging procedures have led to gas leaks, fires, and in rare cases, explosions.

Code-Recognized Purging
Techniques
Purging techniqueDescription
Use a hose to the outdoorsThis involves a long tubing terminating
outside away from air intakes and
sources of ignition with a valve and a gas
technician/fitter at the outside location.
Use a burnerYou use a specially approved burner that
connects to piping and has a propane-
fired pilot light that flares off the gas/air
mixture until a stable flame is
established.
Use pilot tubingOn appliances equipped with a constant
pilot, you can disconnect the tubing at
the gas valve and purge it using the gas
control valve knob. Appliances input
must be less than 400,000 BTU.

Additional Purging Techniques
Purging techniqueDescription
Use a readily accessible burnerWhen an installation includes a gas
range, you may purge the system
piping at the top range burners with
a match lit beside them until such
time as a steady flame is
established. Appliance input must
be less than 400,000 BTU.
Use a purge toolAnnex H outlines the use of this
approved assembly, which
connects to the drip pocket and
allows for purging indoors using the
spring-loaded nozzle valve.

Approved Purge Assembly

Components
The approved purge
assembly connects to the
drip pocket and allows for
purging indoors using the
spring-loaded nozzle valve.
Practical Application
A gas technician using the
purge assembly to safely
purge a gas system
according to code
requirements.

Code Requirements for Purging
Clause 6.23 of CSA B149.1 titled "Purging of gas piping systems
after leak testing," which also references Annex H of the Code,
"Purging of piping and tubing systems where a readily accessible
burner is not available or where an appliance is not equipped with a
continuous pilot," lists purging requirements and procedures.
The gas technician/fitter should review and become familiar with
these Code requirements.

Purging Large Diameter Piping
Identify Large Piping
CSA B149.1 outlines how you must first purge piping of 4 in or greater
Use Inert Gas First
If the test gas was air, purge with nitrogen or carbon dioxide to neutralize the
interior of the piping prior to the purging procedure
Reduce Risk
This helps reduce the risk of a gas/air mixture existing inside the piping and finding
a source of ignition that may flash back
Purge Outdoors
You should always purge piping of this diameter to the outdoors in order to
minimize the amount of gas buildup inside the building

Natural Gas vs. Propane: Key Differences
Main Differences
With respect to purging, the main differences to be aware of between natural gas and propane are their upper and lower
explosive limits and their specific gravities.
Why These Differences Matter
These differences affect how the gases behave during purging operations and what safety precautions must be taken
for each type of gas.
Understanding these differences is crucial for safe and effective purging procedures.

Explosive Limits of Gases
GasApproximate explosive limitsExplosion risk
Natural gasRange from 4% to 15% natural gas in
air
Concentrations above or below these
limits lessen the risk of explosion.
PropaneRange from 2% to 10% propane in airNarrower range than natural gas,
requiring more careful purging.

Specific Gravity of Gases
Air has a specific gravity of 1.0. If a fuel's specific gravity:
•is lower than 1.0, the less dense or lighter the gas; and
•is higher than 1.0, the denser or heavier the gas.

Natural Gas Properties
Specific Gravity:

## 0.60 

Natural gas is lighter
than air (air = 1.0)
Rises in Air
Because its specific
gravity is lower than
that of air, natural gas
is lighter than air and
will rise above it in a
confined space
Natural Venting
This quality of natural
gas allows it to vent
naturally to
atmosphere when
there is a path for it to
do so

Propane Properties
Specific Gravity: 1.5
Propane is heavier than air (air = 1.0)
Sinks in Air
Because it is heavier than air, propane will collect in the lower areas of confined spaces
Explosion Hazard
This property of propane can create a dangerous explosion hazard if it occurs in an area where there is the possibility of the propane
coming into contact with a source of ignition

Propane Purging Safety
Considerations
Pools in Low Areas
A heavier-than-air fuel,
such as propane, pools and
collects in low-lying areas
and is more difficult to
ventilate than natural gas
Flammable Mixture
Risk
This creates the risk of a
flammable mixture that is
ready to ignite from any
source of ignition
Outdoor Purging Recommended
It is always a safer procedure to utilize a purge hose to the
outdoors in accordance with Code guidelines when purging
propane gas piping systems

Pressure Testing Timing
Installation
Complete piping installation
Pressure Test
Perform before any appliances are
installed
Leak Test
Required after appliance installation
Final Verification
Ensure system integrity before use
When during a piping installation should pressure testing be carried out? Before any appliance is installed. A leak test is
required after the appliance is installed.

Pressure Gauge
Requirements
2
Minimum Diameter
The minimum diameter gauge that can be used for pressure testing is 2
inches (50 mm)
100
Pressure Range
Typical pressure gauge range in kPa for residential gas systems

Inert Gases for Pressure Testing
Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)
A colorless, odorless gas that is heavier than air and non-
flammable, making it safe for pressure testing gas
systems.
Nitrogen (N₂)
An inert gas that comprises about 78% of Earth's
atmosphere. It's non-flammable and slightly lighter than
air, making it ideal for pressure testing.
What two inert gases may be used to pressure-test gas piping systems? Carbon dioxide and Nitrogen.

Post-Valve Opening Procedure
Open Gas Valve
Open the gas valve at the gas meter
Listen for Flow
Listen for the gas flow to stop
Monitor Test Dial
Monitor the gas meter test dial
What should be done immediately after opening the gas valve at the gas meter? Listen for the gas flow to stop and monitor the
gas meter test dial.

Leak Detection Methods
Leak Detecting
Solution
By wiping each joint in the
system with a leak
detecting solution (i.e.,
soap and water),
technicians can identify
leaks through the formation
of bubbles at the leak point.
Meter Movement
Watching the meter for
movement when all
appliances are off can
indicate a leak somewhere
in the system.

Propane System Testing Steps
Place a pressure gauge on the system
First step in the testing process
Pressurize the system by opening the manual valves on each stage
Second step to build pressure in the system
When the system is up to pressure, close the manual valves
Third step to isolate the system
Mark the pressure gauges and observe for leakage
Fourth step to detect any pressure drops
Do a main manual shut-off valve seepage test
Final step to ensure valve integrity

Importance of Proper Purging
Safety Risks of Improper Purging
Incorrect purging methods and shortcuts have led to
numerous leaks, fires, and even explosions. lt is imperative
that gas technicians have louts hare four even explosion in
the skills.
It is imperative that gas technicians/fitters maintain safe
and approved purging meth work conducted.
Consequences of improper purging can be catastrophic,
resulting in property damage, injuries, or fatalities.

Purging Sequence Importance
Identify Farthest Appliance
Locate the appliance that is farthest from the gas source
Begin Purging
Start purging at this farthest point to ensure complete system
purging
Move to Branch Lines
Purge branch lines one by one, starting with the farthest from the
source
Complete Each Line
Ensure each branch line is fully purged before moving to the next

Outdoor Purging Method
Hose to Outdoors
This involves a long tubing
terminating outside away
from air intakes and sources
of ignition with a valve and a
gas technician/fitter at the
outside location.
Safety Considerations
When purging outdoors,
ensure the area is well-
ventilated, free from
ignition sources, and that
the purge point is
positioned to prevent gas
from entering buildings
through windows, doors, or
air intakes.

Purge Burner Method
Specialized Equipment
You use a specially approved burner that connects to piping and
has a propane-fired pilot light that flares off the gas/air mixture
until a stable flame is established.
This method provides a controlled way to burn off the gas/air
mixture during purging, reducing the risk of creating an explosive
mixture in the surrounding area.

Pilot Tubing Purge Method
Identify Eligible Appliances
On appliances equipped with a constant pilot and input less than
400,000 BTU
Disconnect Tubing
Disconnect the tubing at the gas valve
Use Control Valve
Purge using the gas control valve knob

Range Burner Purge Method
Applicable Scenarios
When an installation includes a gas range, you may purge
the system piping at the top range burners with a match lit
beside them until such time as a steady flame is established.
Input Limitation
Appliance input must be less than 400,000 BTU.

Purge Tool Method
Approved Assembly
Annex H outlines the use of this approved assembly, which
connects to the drip pocket and allows for purging indoors
using the spring-loaded nozzle valve.
Practical Application
The purge tool provides a controlled method for indoor
purging when other methods are not feasible or available.

Code Reference for Purging
Clause 6.23 of CSA B149.1
"Purging of gas piping systems
after leak testing"
Annex H of the Code
"Purging of piping and tubing
systems where a readily accessible
burner is not available or where an
appliance is not equipped with a
continuous pilot"
Technician Responsibility
The gas technician/fitter should
review and become familiar with
these Code requirements.

Large Diameter Piping Purge
Process
Identify Large Piping
Piping of 4 in or greater diameter
Initial Purge with Inert Gas
If test gas was air, purge with nitrogen or carbon dioxide
Neutralize Interior
This neutralizes the interior of the piping prior to the gas
purging procedure
Final Gas Purge
Complete the purging with the actual gas to be used

Risk Reduction in Large Pipe Purging
Flash Back Prevention
Using inert gas first helps reduce the risk of a gas/air mixture
existing inside the piping and finding a source of ignition
that may flash back.
Outdoor Purging Requirement
You should always purge piping of this diameter to the
outdoors in order to minimize the amount of gas buildup
inside the building.

Natural Gas Explosive Limits
4%
Lower Explosive Limit
Minimum concentration of natural gas in air that can ignite
15%
Upper Explosive Limit
Maximum concentration of natural gas in air that can ignite
Concentrations above or below these limits lessen the risk of explosion.

Propane Explosive Limits
2%
Lower Explosive Limit
Minimum concentration of propane in air that can ignite
10%
Upper Explosive Limit
Maximum concentration of propane in air that can ignite
Propane has a narrower explosive range than natural gas, requiring more careful purging procedures.

Understanding Specific Gravity
Air has a specific gravity of 1.0. If a fuel's specific gravity is lower than 1.0, the gas is less dense or lighter than air. If it's higher than 1.0, the gas is denser or heavier than air.

Natural Gas Behavior
Specific Gravity: 0.60
Because its specific gravity is lower than that of air, natural
gas is lighter than air and will rise above it in a confined
space.
This quality of natural gas allows it to vent naturally to
atmosphere when there is a path for it to do so.

Propane Behavior
Specific Gravity: 1.5
Because it is heavier than air, propane will collect in the
lower areas of confined spaces.
This property of propane can create a dangerous explosion
hazard if it occurs in an area where there is the possibility of
the propane coming into contact with a source of ignition.

Propane Purging Safety
Pooling Behavior
A heavier-than-air fuel,
such as propane, pools and
collects in low-lying areas
and is more difficult to
ventilate than natural gas.
Flammable Mixture
Risk
This creates the risk of a
flammable mixture that is
ready to ignite from any
source of ignition.
Outdoor Purging Recommendation
It is always a safer procedure to utilize a purge hose to the
outdoors in accordance with Code guidelines when purging
propane gas piping systems.

Understanding Corrosion
What is Corrosion?
Corrosion is one of the ways that a pure metal can revert to a
more stable compound. Some metals, when unprotected
from the atmosphere, gradually corrode.
The metals used to make pipelines and piping systems are
generally pure. However, you can also find metals as
chemical compounds such as oxides, sulphides, and other
salts.
Stability of Compounds
Many metals are more stable in their natural compound than
as a pure metal. For example, iron oxide (rust) is more stable
than the pure iron used in pipes. It is more stable because
the atmosphere has reacted with the iron to create the
compound iron oxide. As a compound, iron oxide has no
further chemical reaction to atmospheric elements and is
therefore stable.

Corrosion Protection and Control
Specialized Expertise
Qualified corrosion engineers should supervise protection systems
System Design
Proper design of piping protection systems
Installation
Correct installation techniques for corrosion prevention
Testing
Verification of protection system effectiveness
Corrosion protection and control is a highly specialized area. A qualified corrosion engineer or a firm specializing in this work should always supervise
the design, installation, and testing of piping protection systems. (You can obtain a current list of corrosion specialists from the local gas authority.)
Nevertheless, as a gas technician/fitter, you must fully understand the corrosion process so that you can take preventive measures when internation
the contribution of repairing piping that may be exposed to corrosive conditions.

The Corrosion Process
Anode
The metal surface where electrons
leave and oxidation occurs
Conductive Path
The metal that allows current to flow
between anode and cathode
Electrolyte
The medium (often water or soil) that
conducts electric current
Cathode
The metal surface where electrons
enter and reduction occurs
Corrosion is an electrochemical action that changes pure metals into their compound, while producing electric current.
Corrosion cannot occur if any of these four elements is absent.

Anode and Cathode in Corrosion
Electrical Circuit
Metal corrodes when there is a complete electrical circuit.
The electrical current travels from the anode to the cathode
in the electrolyte. This is conventional current the
movement of positive charges you can find in a basic
electrical circuit.
The anode and cathode are what you call electrodes. The
current flows between them, causing corrosion at the
anode.

Dry Cell Battery Example
Dry Cell Battery
Structure
An everyday example of
how we benefit from this
electrochemical action is
the dry cell battery. The dry
cell battery produces an
electric current because the
zinc casing is an anode and
the carbon rod is a cathode.
Current Flow
The electric current runs
from the anode to the
cathode, passes through
the light, and goes back to
the anode. This is the same
principle that causes
corrosion in metal pipes.

The Role of Electrolyte in
Corrosion
Water as Essential Element
Dry metals, in general, do not corrode. Water is essential to the
corrosion process, as it acts as the conductor of the electric
currents. It is what you call the electrolyte.
Contaminants Accelerate Corrosion
Although pure water is a poor electrical conductor, traces of salts,
acids, or alkalis increase its effectiveness as an electrolyte and
greatly accelerate corrosion processes.
Soil as Electrolyte
Water and these contaminants are present in most soils and, with
the oxygen that permeates the soil from the air above, all the
corrosive agents are present.

Soil Resistivity and Corrosion
High Resistivity Soils
Dry soil and gravel have high resistance to electrical current
Low Resistivity Soils
Moist soil, loam, and clay have low resistance to electric current
Corrosion Risk
Piping buried in moist soil is more prone to corrosion
Soils have varying abilities to resist current flow and therefore have varying abilities as an electrolyte. A soil with very high
resistance to electrical current is a poor electrolyte. A moist soil with low resistance to electric current is a more efficient
electrolyte.

Metallic Path in Corrosion
Current Flow in Underground Pipes
In an unprotected underground pipe, the electric current
flows from the anodic areas of the pipe —through the soil
(the electrolyte)—to the cathodic areas. The current then
returns through the pipe to complete the circuit.
Metallic Path Definition
The metallic path is the pipe length that the electrical
current travels from the time it enters the cathode until it
leaves the anode.

Metals with Different Potentials
Electromotive Scale
All metals have a known electrical
value on an electromotive scale.
Current Flow
If two metals have different electrical
potential, a current will flow between
them from active metals to less active
metals.
Corrosion Result
The current flows between metals of
differing potential regardless of
whether the metals are close together
or far apart.

Types of Corrosion Based on Metal Proximity
Surface Corrosion
Surface corrosion occurs when the differing metals are close together, for example, when there is
mill scale on steel piping.
Soil-Induced Corrosion
When the soil quality changes from one end of a pipeline to another, the soil's resistivity may
change the metal's potential. This again creates current flow and corrosion occurs.

Soil Resistivity Measurement
Resistivity Definition
Resistivity is the soil's (electrolyte's) resistance to electric force within a
cube measuring 1 cm. It is expressed in ohm/cm.
Corrosion Risk Assessment
Nearly all soils are corrosive to steel, and those below 10,000 ohms/cm
are considered especially corrosive. Soils below 5,000 ohms/cm are
sufficiently corrosive to cast iron or ductile iron to warrant cathodic
protection.
Measurement Method
The Wenner four pin method is the technique usually used for
measuring resistivity. This method involves direct driving of four pins
into the ground in a straight line at specific distances apart, imposition
of a current between the two outside pins, and measurement of the
voltage across the two inside pins.

General Corrosion
Protection Principles
Protective Coatings
Piping and tubing is
covered with an approved
corrosion-resistant paint or
coating, when conditions
require
Wall Protection
Piping and tubing is coated
or wrapped where it passes
through walls where it
could sustain physical
damage, and be subject to
corrosion
Material-Specific Treatment
Different types of pipe and tubing require different treatment
based on their material properties

Copper Pipe and Tubing Protection
Requirements
LocationProtection Requirements
Above groundWhere it passes through concrete, cement
block, or similar locations that would cause
corrosive action if the copper came in
direct contact with the material it passes
through
Above groundWhere the copper may contact a dissimilar
metal
Above groundWhere the copper may come in contact
with corrosive chemicals or vapours
UndergroundAll underground copper tubing
installations require the use of Type L or G
copper having an approved protective
coating. The use of Type K copper is
allowed. This type does not require
external protection.

Copper Protection Methods - Above Ground
Standard
Installation
You may use
uncoated copper
pipe and tubing in
above ground
applications where it
is not exposed to
corrosive elements or
physical damage.
Wall Penetration
- Exterior
Coat or double wrap
copper pipe and
tubing that passes
through exterior
concrete or masonry
walls with an
approved protective
tape, with waterproof
caulking applied at
the entrance and exit
points.
Wall Penetration
- Interior
Coat or double wrap
copper pipe and
tubing that passes
through interior
concrete or masonry
walls with an
approved protective
tape. Caulking is not
required.
Dissimilar Metals
To avoid possible
electrolytic action, do
not allow copper pipe
and tubing to come in
contact with
dissimilar metals. If
this is unavoidable,
double wrap the
copper with tape or
insulation to provide
galvanic protection.

Copper Protection Methods - Underground
Type K Copper
Type K copper can be used
underground without external
protection due to its thicker wall
construction.
Type L or G Copper
Copper tubing used in underground
applications must be Type K, L, or G
copper. Type L or G copper must
have an approved, external coating.
Mounting Considerations
Whenever possible, use only copper
or plastic mounting clips to secure
copper pipe and tubing to avoid
dissimilar metal contact.

Steel and Iron Pipe Protection Requirements
Above Ground Requirements
•Where it passes through concrete, cement block, or
similar locations that would cause corrosive action if the
pipe came in direct contact with the material it passes
through
•Where the pipe may contact a dissimilar metal
•Where the pipe may come in contact with corrosive
chemicals or vapours
Underground Requirements
Installations require protection for steel and iron pipe by
means of an approved method or combination of methods,
including:
•Protective coating
•Corrosion-resistant wrapping
•Cathodic protection
•Electrical bonding
•Isolation of individual pipe sections

Steel and Iron Protection Methods - Above
Ground
1
Corrosive Environment Protection
Steel and iron pipe used in above-ground applications
where it is exposed to corrosive elements must have
an approved protective coating or corrosion-resistant
wrapping.
2
Exterior Wall Penetration
Coat, sleeve, or double wrap steel and iron pipe that
passes through exterior concrete or masonry walls
with an approved protective tape, with waterproof
caulking applied at the entrance and exit points.
3
Interior Wall Penetration
Coat, sleeve, or double wrap steel and iron pipe that
passes through interior concrete or masonry walls
with an approved protective tape. Caulking is not
required.
4
Dissimilar Metal Contact
To avoid possible electrolytic action, do not allow steel
and iron pipe to come in contact with dissimilar
metals. If this is unavoidable, double wrap the pipe
with tape or insulation to provide galvanic protection.

Steel and Iron Protection Methods - Underground
Usage Limitations
Steel and iron pipe is not usually used underground, because only welded joints are acceptable and because this pipe is vulnerable to
corrosion.
Required Protection
If the local inspection authority permits the use of steel and iron pipe underground, ensure that the pipe have a coating or wrap with
corrosion-resistant material.
Joint Protection
Wrap all joints and risers with approved corrosion-resistant material.
Cathodic Protection
Bond a correctly sized anode to the pipe by cadwelding.
Electrical Isolation
Install a dielectric union or insulating flanges above grade at each end of the pipe run.

Plastic Pipe Installation
Underground Use Only
You may only use polyethylene pipe
(plastic pipe) for underground
installations.
Riser Material Requirements
Note that the material of all risers
that extend above grade must be
steel or copper.
Connection Requirements
Connectors must be approved
transition fittings, and a tracer wire
must follow the pipe for future
locating.

Methods for Protecting Underground Piping
Protective Coatings
Insulate pipe from soil using
materials with high electrical
resistance
•Coal tar coatings
•Extruded polyethylene
•Protective tapes
Electrical Insulation
Prevent current flow between
different metal components
•Dielectric fittings
•Insulated unions
•Insulated flanges
Cathodic Protection
Use sacrificial anodes or impressed
current systems
•Magnesium anodes
•Zinc anodes
•Rectifier systems

Protective Coatings for Underground Piping
Coating Properties
A good coating has a high electrical resistance. It adheres tightly to the pipe
and has the strength to withstand installation and handling, soil stresses,
and any tendency towards cracking.
Yard applied coal tar and extruded polyethylene are the main coatings
used. While most coatings allow some current to penetrate through to the
steel surface, for most practical purposes, the steel is considered isolated
from the soil.
Coating Limitations
In theory, this would be enough to prevent corrosion; however, it is virtually
impossible to install a pipeline without some coating damage. The portions
of pipe that become exposed in the soil corrode more quickly because the
corrosion is concentrated in those areas.

Repairing Pipe with Protective
Coating
Use Approved Materials
When repairing or adding to a pipe that has a protective coating, ensure
you use approved protective coatings such as Polyken tape or heatshrink
sleeves.
Quality Testing
Upon repairing the pipe, check the quality of the protective coating
with the Jeep Test, an Open Circuit Potential test, to find any holidays
(defects) in the coating so that you can repair them before burying the
piping.
Electrical Insulation
Ensure that a protected piping system is electrically insulated from
other metallic structures by installing a dielectric fitting on the
pipeline directly outside the building wall.

Dielectric Fittings
Dielectric Fitting Protection
Dielectric fitting protects underground pipeline from above-ground
piping by preventing electrical current flow between the two systems.
Insulated Fitting
Insulated fitting to protect pipe from contact with other pipe systems.
Additionally, insulated couplings separate long gas piping networks
into individual electrical units. In this way, long electric current lines are
inhibited, and you can accurately assess the number of anodes
required for each unit.

Bonding of Piping
Code Requirements
CSA B149.1, Clause 4.7.3 requires, "All interior metal gas
piping that may become energized shall be made electrically
continuous and shall be bonded in accordance with the
requirements of the local electrical code, or in absence of
such, the Canadian Electrical Code, Part I."
CSA B149.1 forbids the use of gas piping as an electrical
ground, while the Canadian Electrical Code, Part I requires
bonding of continuous metal gas piping systems in a
building supplied with electric power.
Bonding vs. Grounding
It is important to note that bonding and grounding are not
the same. Bonding, as defined in the Canadian Electrical
Code, is, "a low impedance path obtained by permanently
joining all non-current-carrying metal parts to ensure
electrical continuity and having the capacity to conduct
safely any current likely to be imposed on it."
Grounding, as defined in Canadian Electrical Code, is, "a
permanent and continuous conductive path to the earth
with sufficient ampacity to carry any fault current liable to be
imposed on it, and of a sufficiently low impedance to limit
the voltage rise above ground and to facilitate the operation
of the protective devices in the circuit."

Important Bonding Considerations
Equipotential Bonding
Code-compliant bonding of gas
piping in the field will ensure the
gas piping is made equipotential
with the non-current-carrying
conductive parts of electrical
equipment.
CSST Considerations
The requirement in Rule 10-700
c) of the Canadian Electrical Code
to provide equipotential bonding
to a metal gas piping system is not
intended to apply to metal gas
tubing, i.e., CSST. Attempts to
bond metal gas tubing with
conventional bonding means can
create a hazardous situation
where the tubing can be
punctured by installation of the
bonding means or by arcing
between improperly secured
bonding faults or lightning strikes.
Proper Connection
The grounding conductor at a
building connects to a grounding
electrode, and CSA B149.1, as well
as the Canadian Electrical Code,
require the bonding of the gas
piping to that system be installed
in an approved manner. This
bonding connection provides
equipotentiality - the state in
which conductive parts are at a
substantially equal electric
potential.

Consult local codes for such
items as water supply shutoff,
vacuum relief, temperature
and/or pressure relief, and
cross-connection control
requirements.
Building Code Regulations
The installation of plastic piping and tubing must be in accordance
with Building Code regulations concerning combustible piping and
fire separations, etc.

Often used with copper and
plastic tubing
Flared
Used on soft copper tubing
Solvent Welded
Used with some plastic pipes
Crimped

Another method for joining pipes

Threaded Joints
Description
Threaded joints are what you use on some water pipe and
fittings, as well as adapters such as those used to join the
threaded outlets of a hot water to incoming copper or plastic
water distribution tubing.
You should use an approved thread sealant with this type of
joint.
Figure 5-2 shows a typical threaded joint.

Solder Joints
Definition
Soldering can refer to the process of joining two or more pieces of
metal together by means of an alloy that has a lower melting
temperature than the metal being joined.
Solder Types
The many different solders available use alloys consisting of various
combinations of tin, head, silver, and copper.

Soft Soldering vs. Hard Soldering
Common Practice
The joining of copper tubing using
hard and soft solders is common in the
plumbing and gas trades.
Key Differences
The difference between a soft-
soldered joint and one that is hard-
soldered (also known as silver
brazing) is the melting temperature of
the solder.
Hard solders have a melting
temperature above 1000°F (537°C)
and provide a stronger joint.
Health Considerations
With concerns related to lead
exposure, plumbing products such as
flux and solder now come lead-free.

Compression Joints
Components
A compression-type fitting often joins copper and plastic tubing.
A compression fitting is composed of a fitting body, a nut, and a
ferrule.
You place the nut and ferrule over the tubing, then insert the
tubing into the fitting body. You then tighten the external thread
of the fitting body, compressing the ferrule and sealing the joint.
In some cases when plastic tubing is used, place a supporting
insert inside the tubing to prevent it from collapsing as it is being
tightened.

Flared Joints - Part 1
Purpose
Flared joints are what you use on soft copper tubing. This type of
joint requires a special tool to form the flare on the end of the tubing.
Step 1
Cut the end of the copper tubing square and smooth. You may
ream the inside edge and slightly chamfer the outside edge to
ensure a clean, tight joint.
Step 2
Place a flare nut and any other necessary parts of the fitting
over the copper tubing in the correct orientation and slide
down the tubing to leave the end clear for flaring.

Flared Joints - Part 2
Step 3
Insert the tubing into the block of the flaring tool. The block or die
bar of the compression-type flaring tool shown in Figure 5-4 swings
open to allow insertion of the copper tubing and, when closed and
tightened by means of wing nuts, holds the tubing securely in
position.
Alternative Tool
You can also use a ratchet-style flaring tool. See Figure 5-5.
Step 4
Centre the die over the open end of the tubing and turn the
handle to force the die down onto tubing to form the flare.

Flaring Tools
Compression-Type Flaring Tool
Traditional flaring tool with wing nuts to
secure the tubing
Ratchet-Style Flaring Tool
More modern design with ratchet
mechanism for easier operation
Properly Made Flare
Example of a correctly formed flare on
copper tubing

Solvent-Welded Joints
Preparation
Some plastic pipes are joined by using solvent cement
(glue). The piping end must be square and the pipe and
socket fitting must be clean and dry.
Application
Apply the cement to both the pipe and socket, and push
the pipe into the socket to complete and arrange the joint.
Compatibility
The cement must be suitable for the type of pipe being
used.

Crimped Joints
Application
This type of joint is what you use with plastic tubing.
Components
It consists of an insert fitting with raised grooves (barb type) on
the ends that you insert into the tubing, and a crimp ring that you
place over the tubing.
Process
Use a special crimping tool sized for that diameter of tubing
to compress the ring.

Expansion Joints - Part 1
Principle
This type of joint uses the memory effect of polyethylene to make a
water-tight seal and is typically used with PEX-a, cross-linked
polyethylene (Uponor uses this manufacturer and joining method).
Mechanism
The fitting is slightly larger than the original inside diameter of the
tubing, so the memory effect allows the tubing to return to its
original form, providing a continuous, watertight seal.

Expansion Joints - Part 2
Step 1
Cut the tubing square, and then place a polyethylene collar over
the end of the tubing.
Step 2
Place a special tool in the end of the tube, and expand the tubing
and collar.
Step 3
Remove the tool and insert the fitting into the tubing.
Step 4
The tubing immediately tries to return to its original diameter, in
effect shrinking itself around the fitting to create a water-tight seal.

Expansion Joint Features
Extra Strength
The collar provides extra
strength at the joint.
Color Coding
It is also colour coded to
provide identification of hot
and cold-water lines.

Cross-Connection Control
Definition
A cross-connection is any physical
connection between a potable water
supply and any source of
contamination.
Prevention Devices
•Backflow preventers
•Vacuum breakers
•Air gaps
•Check valves
Importance
Proper cross-connection control is
essential to prevent contamination of
the potable water supply.

Water Hammer Prevention
What is Water
Hammer?
Water hammer is the banging
noise that occurs when
flowing water suddenly stops
or changes direction, creating
a pressure wave in the pipes.
Prevention Methods
•Install water hammer
arrestors
•Secure pipes properly with
adequate supports
•Reduce water pressure if
excessive
•Install slow-closing valves
Location Recommendations
Install water hammer arrestors near quick-closing valves, such as
those on washing machines, dishwashers, and toilets.

Thermal Expansion Considerations
The Issue
When water is heated, it expands. In a
closed system (with backflow
prevention), this expansion can create
excessive pressure.
Solutions
•Thermal expansion tanks
•Pressure relief valves
•Expansion loops in piping
Installation Location
Expansion tanks should be installed
on the cold water supply line to the
water heater.

Pipe Insulation
Energy Efficiency
Insulating hot water pipes reduces heat loss and saves energy
Freeze Protection
Insulation helps prevent pipes from freezing in cold areas
Condensation Prevention
Insulating cold water pipes prevents condensation and potential
water damage
Noise Reduction
Insulation can help reduce water flow noise in pipes

Water Heater Connections
Copper Connections
Copper piping connected to water heaters should use dielectric unions to prevent galvanic corrosion between dissimilar metals.
PEX Connections
When using PEX tubing, ensure it's rated for the temperatures near the water heater. Some codes require metal piping for the first 18 inches from the water heater.
Safety Devices
All water heaters must have properly installed temperature and pressure relief valves with appropriate discharge piping.

Boiler Connections
Supply and Return Lines
Boiler connections typically include supply and return lines, which must be properly sized according to the boiler's specifications.
Safety Devices
Boilers require pressure relief valves, expansion tanks, and other safety devices as specified by local codes.
Zone Controls
Multi-zone systems require appropriate valves and controls to direct hot water to different areas of the building.

safely and efficiently.

efficient operation of gas appliances. This requires understanding
various factors that affect pipe sizing and applying the correct
calculations based on the specific application requirements.

Factors affecting pipe sizing
Pipe sizing is an important consideration on a gas installation. Properly sized piping or tubing helps ensure that adequate supply pressure and volume of fuel is available at all appliance specifications for inlet pressure, and
subsequently appliance firing rates, are achievable.
Gas piping should be large enough to meet maximum demands without undue pressure loss, i.e., a pressure drop, between the meter and the appliance.
Pressure drop is the working pressure at the meter installation downstream of the service regulator minus the working pressure at the appliance. The purpose of the pipe sizing tables is to assist you in determining the pipe
size suitable for the project.
Undersized piping may lead to low gas pressure at the appliances, under-fired equipment, and poor performance. Oversized piping inflates job costs and wastes money.
Factors to Consider Before Installation
FactorConsideration
Fuel typeNatural gas and propane have different calorific values—i.e., propane requires less fuel for the same
btu rating of appliance- and different specific gravity.
Length of runThe greater the distance from the appliance to the meter, the larger the supply piping may have to be.
Allowable pressure dropThe supply pressure available will also determine pipe size.
Maximum gas consumptionYou must account for the total load of all appliances firing at the same moment when sizing.
Piping configurationsThe number of fittings, manifold headers, and branch lines utilized all become factors when sizing pipe.
Some piping manufacturers, such as the manufacturers of CSST products, supply their own sizing tables because the CSA B149.1 Tables do not take into account the special features and characteristics of these products.
Passes in the required manufacturer training and certification would cover these piping specifics.
The steel piping tables in CSA B149.1 include plastic gas piping allowances, which can accommodate plastic as well as steel pipe.

Pipe measurement and fitting
allowance
Pipe measuring methods
Generally, you use one of the following three methods to measure pipe
lengths:
1
End-to-end
Measuring the pipe without
any fittings
2
End-to-centre
Measuring from the centre of
a fitting on one end to the
opposite end of the pipe
3
Centre-to-centre
Measuring the distance between the centres of two fittings in a line
of pipe

End-to-end and End-to-centre Measurements
End-to-end
The "end-to-end" measurement is the measurement of the pipe
without any fittings. See Figure 6-1.
Figure 6-1 End-to-end measurement
End-to-centre
You take an "end-to-centre" measurement from the centre of a fitting
screwed on one end to the opposite end of the pipe. See Figure 6-2.
Make an end-to-centre measurement by first tightening a fitting on the
threaded end of a pipe. Place the end of the rule exactly in the centre of
the fitting, measure along the pipe, and mark at the proper distance.
Figure 6-2

Centre-to-centre and Additional Measuring Methods
Centre-to-centre
Most pipe drawings are shown as "centre-to-centre" measurements. A centre-to-centre measurement is the distance between the
centre of two fittings in a line of pipe. See Figure 6-3.
Figure 6-3
Additional measuring methods
Although not as commonly used as the preceding methods, there are additional methods of taking pipe measurements. These
measurements, which you can see in Figure 6-4, are:
•back-to-back
•centre-to-back
•centre-to-throat
•overall centre-to-centre

Fitting allowance
As pointed out previously, you usually make pipe measurements end-to-centre or centre-to-centre.
Using the end-to-centre measurement (see Figure 6-5), notice that the end of the pipe will not screw into the centre of the fitting. Therefore, you must make a certain allowance "F" for the fitting, and cut the pipe that much shorter.
You may measure fitting allowance on the job. Otherwise, you can find it in the manufacturer's catalogue. However, since fitting measurements are not the same for all manufacturers, it is very important that you obtain the allowance from the catalogue of the manufacturer of
that fitting.
Calculating fitting allowance
The measurements given are from the centre to the fitting (see Figure 6-6), a standard malleable elbow.
Measurement indicated by letterMeasured
"A"The centre-to-face measurement
"T"The thread engagement or the distance the pipe screws into the fitting
"F"The fitting allowance, the space between the centre of the fitting and the end of the pipe
Using these identifying letters, the formula for determining the fitting allowance is F = A - T.
Figure 6-6 Fitting measurement

Example of Fitting Allowance Calculation
What is the fitting allowance for an NPS 3, 90°, 150-pound malleable elbow using a Crane fitting?
•"A", the centre-to-face measurement, is 3 1/8 in Table 6-1
•"T", the thread engagement, is 1 in at the bottom of Table 6-1.
Table 6-1 Dimensions of 150-pound malleable iron fittings and normal engagement between male and female threads
150-pound malleable iron crane fittings
These dimensions apply to both banded and plain fittings; their centre to end dimensions are alike.
*Close pattern return bends can not be used to make up parallel coils. The centre to centre dimension is so close that the bands of adjacent bends will not clear each other.

Sizing of low-pressure piping systems
Factors that influence gas flow
Type of Gas
Different gases flow at different rates due to their density
Type of Pipe
Pipe material affects internal resistance to gas flow
Length of Pipe
Longer pipes create more resistance to flow
Diameter of Pipe
Larger diameters allow greater gas flow
Number of Fittings
Each fitting adds resistance to gas flow
Pressure Drop
Affects the resistance through the pipe

Type of Gas and Type of Pipe
Type of gas
Before you attempt to size pipe, you should clearly understand how the following six factors affect the flow rate of gas:
•type of gas
•type of pipe
•length of pipe
•diameter of pipe
•number of fittings
•pressure drop
Propane and natural gas flow through pipe at different rates because they have different relative densities. (Relative density is the
weight of a gas compared to air. Other terms to describe density are specific gravity, relative weight, and specific weight.) The relative
density of propane is heavier than natural gas.
Since lighter gases flow through a pipe more easily than heavier gases, larger volumes of natural gas can flow through a pipe than
propane (if both supply pressures are the same).

Type of Pipe and Length of Pipe
Type of pipe
An internal resistance forms as the gas molecules slide along the walls of the pipe. Pipes with smooth interior walls cause less resistance
than pipes with rough interior walls.
For example, copper tubing offers less resistance (and therefore a higher flow rate) than an iron pipe with the same inside diameter.
Length of pipe
The resistance factor also applies to the length of pipe: the longer the pipe, the greater the resistance.

Diameter of Pipe
The larger the pipe diameter, the greater the gas flow through the system.

between pipe diameter and potential
gas flow capacity

Number of Fittings and Pressure Drop
Number of fittings
Each fitting on a piping system adds resistance to the gas flow. For this reason, it is important to design a system with as few
fittings as possible.
If the pipe sizing table includes fittings, the figures have included a 20% allowance, which is more than enough for a normal
piping system.
Pressure drop
Pressure drop is the pressure difference between the gas supply (either the gas meter or a system pressure regulator) and a gas
appliance. The greater the pressure drop, the greater the resistance through a pipe.
The Natural gas and propane installation code specifies the maximum allowable pressure drop in a system, based on the system
pressure.
You must design natural gas piping systems with pressures:
•less than 7 in w.c. (1.75 kPa), so the pressure drop does not exceed 0.5 in w.c. (125 Pa); and
•of 7 in w.c. to 14 in w.c. (1.75 kPa to 3.5 kPa), so the pressure drop does not exceed 1 in w.c. (250 Pa).
Design of propane piping systems of 11 in w.c. (2.7 kPa) must not allow the pressure drop to exceed 1 in w.c. (250 Pa).

Sizing low-pressure systems
The discussion of pipe sizing usually specifies low-pressure or high-
pressure systems. Low-pressure systems, a topic of this Chapter, are
those which contain gas pressures up to 0.5 psig (3.5 kPa).

Drawing a System Sketch
Drawing a sketch of the whole piping system allows you to identify and locate important system components. Knowing the details about these system components will
ultimately guide you to choose the correct pipe sizing table.
System Components
InformationDescription
Gas supplyThe gas supply may be a meter that a local utility company installed for natural
gas or propane. Also, supply of propane may come from a storage container.
System pressureAfter carefully considering available gas pressures, you will choose the pressure
that best suits the job and conforms to local codes.
Appliance locationThe building design, not the gas technician/fitter, usually fixes the appliance's
location.
Appliance inputsAppliance input is the amount of heat that can be generated in the combustion
chamber every hour. This therefore determines the amount of gas that the
appliance requires. The manufacturer determines each appliance's input, which
is then stamped on a rating plate and permanently affixed to the equipment.
Piping routeYou must determine the best piping route, that is, the one that uses the least
amount of pipe, fittings, and valves.

Valves and Related Equipment
Every piping system requires valves and other equipment such as regulators. You must know where to locate this equipment
before sizing the piping system.
Shutoff Valves
Essential for isolating sections of the
system for maintenance or
emergencies
Pressure Regulators
Control and maintain consistent gas
pressure throughout the system
Gas Meters
Measure gas consumption and often
serve as the connection point to the
utility supply

Identify the pipe sizing table
There are over 50 pipe sizing tables in CSA B149.1. Finding the correct table can be a complex undertaking unless you have the required information. Each table is
identified by a sequence of pipe system criteria:
Required Information
InformationDescription
Type of gasDetermine the type of gas based on availability and cost. Natural gas is
usually the cheapest fuel.
Type of pipeDetermine the type of pipe you will use after considering costs of material
and labour, code restrictions, and job specifications.
System pressuresDetermine system pressure after considering the following: available
pressures from the gas utility; code restrictions; specifications; and cost of
system installations.
Maximum pressure dropThe maximum pressure drop is the maximum allowable drop in pressure
across a piping system as specified by the code and the system pressure.
You must thoroughly understand system pressures and allowable pressure
drops before selecting a pipe sizing table.

Selecting the table
Now that you clearly understand how to identify a pipe sizing table, identify the criteria used to create the table.
Table Selection Criteria
InformationDescription
Type of gasNatural gas
Type of pipeIron pipe
System pressuresLess than 7 in w.c.
Pressure dropFlow rates based on a pressure drop of 0.5 in w.c.
In CSA B149.1, both imperial and metric gas tables are available. The pipe sizing tables, Tables A.1 and A.2, have two parts:
•Part "a" covers imperial measurements; and
•Part "b" covers metric measurements.

Pipe Sizing Tables
Table A.1 Maximum capacity of natural gas in thousands of Btuh for Schedule 40 pipe and plastic pipe, including fittings, for pressures of less than 7 in w.c. based on a
pressure drop of 0.5 in w.c.
(See Clauses 6.3.2, 6.3.5, A.2.3, A.2.4, A.2.6, and A.3.5.)
Notice that the table title includes all the necessary criteria: Schedule 40 pipe, system pressure of 1.75 kPa to 3.5 kPa and a pressure drop of 250 Pa. The volume of gas
flow is expressed in metric Units (kW).
Table A.2 Maximum capacity of natural gas in thousands of Btuh for Schedule 40 pipe and plastic pipe, including fittings, for pressures of 7 in w.c. up to 14 in w.c. based on
a pressure drop of 1 in w.c.
(See Clauses 6.3.2, 6.3.4, 6.3.5, A.2.3, A.2.4, A.2.6, A.3.5, E.1.2, and E.2.2.)
Once you have drawn the sketch and selected the correct table, you are ready to size the piping system. Sizing the piping system is just a matter of correctly reading the
table.

Reading the table
In order to correctly read a table, you would have to identify the following information:
•piping loads
•longest measured supply run
•code zone
Key Information
InformationDescription
Piping loadsThis term expresses the volume of fuel that must pass through a pipe each hour. Determine this volume
using the appliance load connected to that pipe. Each section of pipe has its own piping load.
Longest measured supply runThis is the distance from the point of gas supply (gas meter or system regulator) to the manifold of the
furthest appliance. This measurement must be the actual length of pipe as installed. It may be expressed in
feet or metres, depending on the Units of measurement in the pipe sizing table.
Code zoneThe code zone (CZ) is a horizontal grouping of flow values according to the longest measured run. Choosing
the code zone is based on selecting the length of pipe that is exactly the same, or larger, than the longest
measured run. You may use only the flow values in the code zone to size the piping system.
Example
Using Figure 6-7 as a guide, assume a longest measured run (LMR) of 65 ft. Identify the pipe size required to carry a flow rate of 300,000 Btu/h (expressed as 300 MBtu/h for the purpose of the table) and proceed as follows:
1.Look down the Length of Pipe column and identify the code zone (CZ) that is exactly the same or larger than the longest measured run. You will find all load values in the 70 ft code zone.
2.Move across the code zone until you find an equal or greater value than 300 MBtu/h. In this case, you locate 440 MBtu/h.
3.Move up to the top of the column and identify that a NPS 1-1/4 iron pipe size is required.

3.Identify the piping material (iron pipe or copper tubing).
4.Identify the pressure system and the allowable pressure drop.
5.Select the correct pipe sizing table.
6.Calculate the gas load in Btu/h (or kW) on each section of pipe and list each load.
7.Calculate the longest measured run (LMR) in the system.
8.Locate the appropriate code zone (CZ).
9.Size each pipe in the system from the selected code zone.

Converting between metric and imperial measures
With the installation of new appliances and meters, you may have to mix imperial with metric values. For example, you may hook an appliance rated in Btu/h into a meter
delivering its gas in m³. Similarly, you may hook an appliance rated in kilowatts into an older type of gas meter, delivering gas in ft3.
You cannot perform pipe sizing unless all values are imperial or metric. The following conversion factors are what you use for converting between imperial and metric
Units of measure.

Conversion factors for gas pressure Units:
•1 psi = 28 in w.c. = 6.895 kPa
•1 inHg = 2 psi = 6895 Pa

Sizing of 2 psig gas piping systems
Traditionally, the gas utility companies in Canada have offered natural gas to customers at either 7 in w.c. for low-pressure
applications (domestic) or at 5 psig for high-pressure applications (industrial). Additionally, 2 psig gas pressures inside one
and two family dwellings are permitted with both 1 psig and 1.5 psig pressure drops.
Before changes in the production process, natural gas had a high sulphur content and copper tubing had to have a tin-lining.
Now, however, natural gas has a very low sulphur content and standard copper tubing is widely used.
You can install two psig gas piping systems using copper tubing, iron pipe, or a combination of these. Copper tubing offers
some advantages over iron pipe. It is flexible and you can often install it in places where you cannot install iron pipe. Soft types
of copper tubing come in long coils, reducing the number of fittings required in the system. Overall, a copper tube system can
be quicker to install, allowing considerable savings.
Characteristics

Conventional vs. 2 psig Systems
In a conventional low pressure system, natural gas is supplied to the
residential property at about 60 psig (see Figure 6-10). The gas flows through
a service regulator at the gas meter, which reduces the pressure to 7 in w.c.
The gas then flows to the appliances at the same 7 in w.c. pressure.
Notice in Figure 6-10 that the size of the pipe leaving the meter is
comparatively larger than the pipe entering the appliance. The larger pipe size
is required to supply enough volume to all three appliances.
Figure 6-10 Conventional low-pressure piping system
In a 2 psig system, natural gas is also supplied to the residential property at
about 60 psig (see Figure 6-11). The service regulator at the meter reduces
the pressure to 2 psig instead of 7 in w.c. The second regulator reduces the
gas pressure to 7 in w.c.
Notice in Figure 6-11 that a smaller-diameter piping than the conventional
piping delivers the gas to the 2 psig regulators. Note also that supplying two or
more appliances from a single 2 psig regulator is possible.
Figure 6-11 2 psig gas tubing system

2 psig regulators
Because most gas appliances require gas at low pressure, the installation of a regulator is a must to reduce the pressure. You can locate 2-psig regulators anywhere in a building, but their location should be close to the appliances, and they must be accessible.
Shut-off valves
Each regulator must have a shut off valve on the high pressure side for the regulator to be serviced.

Sizing regulators
Take care when sizing regulators, particularly with respect to the inlet pressure:
Inlet pressure = system pressure - pressure drop
As CSA B149.1 tables allow for 1.5 psig pressure drop, the regulator will be sized accordingly:

## 0.5 psig = 2 psig - 1.5 psig

The chart shows the pressure reduction through a typical 2 psig gas system, from the initial supply pressure to the final pressure after the 2 psig regulator.

Sizing a 2 psig system
Sizing a 2 psig piping system can consist of three steps:
1.Draw a sketch.
2.Identify the 2 psig pipe sizing table.
3.Calculate the pipe size.
The sketch of the whole piping system identifies and locates important system components such as:
•gas supply
•piping route
•appliance locations
•2 psig regulator locations
This sketch also allows you to identify the different pressure zones in the piping system:
•2 psig pressure zone-the piping from the meter to the regulator
•low-pressure zone-the piping from the regulator to the appliances
Size each pressure zone separately
For the next two steps (identifying the table and sizing the pipe), you must size each pressure zone separately. It is advisable to first size the low-pressure zone, followed by the 2
psig zone.
You can size any low-pressure zones according to information in the Pipe measurement and fitting allowance section. Remember, you will measure the LMR for the low-
pressure zone from the 2 psig regulator to the appliance.

Identify 2 psig pipe sizing tables
The sizing tables for 2 psig gas pressure also have a 20% allowance for fittings. You do not have to add an extra allowance unless the system has an unusually large number of fiittings. ("Including fittings" is found in the table title if fitting allowance is included.)
Correctly identifying the table for a 2 psig system requires the following information:

Sizing of high-pressure natural gas piping
systems
High-pressure gas is any gas pressure over 1/2 psig. Two psig gas piping systems (as discussed in the Sizing of low-pressure
piping systems section) are also classified as high-pressure systems, but the pipe sizing tables include fittings. This section will
discuss only high-pressure pipe sizing systems for which the pipe sizing table does not allow for fittings.
CSA B149.1 specifies the maximum gas pressure allowed inside different classes of buildings. Single family dwellings are
limited to a maximum of 2 psig. Because commercial and industrial buildings may have heavy flow rates and long pipe runs, it is
more economical to design piping systems with small-diameter pipes. As a result of the smaller pipe size, gas pressure in
industrial and commercial applications ranges from 5 to 20 psig.

Characteristics of High-Pressure Systems
In a conventional low pressure system, natural gas is supplied to the building site at about 60 psig. The gas flows through a
service regulator at the gas meter that reduces the pressure either to 2 psig or to 7 in w.c. These pressures are well-suited to
applications where the pressure requirements are low and the pipe runs are relatively short.
As the flow rates and the pipe length increases, it becomes more economical to design piping systems with higher gas
pressures. This keeps the pipe sizes small. The most common high pressures are 5, 10, and sometimes 20 psig (34, 70, and 140
kPa).

High-pressure regulators
Because most appliances require gas at low pressure, a regulator is installed to reduce the pressure. You must locate the high-pressure regulators where
they are accessible and make provisions to install a vent to the outdoors.
Shut-off valves
Each regulator must have a shut off valve on the high pressure side so that you can service the regulator. It is also good piping practice to have a shut-off
valve on the downstream side to save time and money when servicing the regulator.

Sizing regulators
Take care when sizing regulators, particularly with respect to the inlet pressure.
System pressure - Pressure drop = Inlet pressure
Since the Code tables come with large pressure drops, the regulators are sized with the following inlet pressures:

5 psig50%2-1/2 psig
10 psig50%5 psig

Sizing a high-pressure system

Sizing a high-pressure system
Sizing a high-pressure piping system can consist of three steps:
1.Draw a sketch.
2.Identify the pipe sizing table.
3.Calculate the pipe size.
Drawing a sketch of the whole piping system allows you to identify and locate important system components such as:
•gas supply
•piping route
•system regulator locations
•appliance locations
This sketch also allows you to identify the different pressure zones in the piping system:
Pressure Zones
ZoneDescription
High-pressure zonePiping from the meter to the system regulators or piping between system
regulators
Low-pressure zonePiping from the system regulators to the appliances

Size each pressure zone separately
For the next two steps (identifying the table and sizing the pipe), you must size each pressure zone separately. It is advisable to first size the low-pressure zone, followed by the
high-pressure zone.
You can size all low-pressure zones according to the information in Pipe measurement and fitting allowance section. Remember, you will measure the LMR for the low-pressure
zone from the system regulator to the appliance.
Identify pipe sizing table
To correctly identify the table for a high-pressure piping system, you need the following information:
Required Information

Type of gasNatural gas or propane
Type of pipeIron pipe or copper tubing

You should now be able to identify a pipe sizing table for your specific piping project.

Calculate pipe size
Before listing the steps to sizing the high-pressure piping system, it is important to understand how fittings are allowed for in the calculations. As discussed previously,
there are six factors that influence the flow rate through a pipe. One of these factors, the number of fittings, is particularly relevant to sizing high-pressure systems.

Number of fittings
Fittings and valves create resistance to gas flow. Most low-pressure and 2 psig pipe sizing tables allow for this resistance by including a reasonable
number of pipe fittings in the table calculations. Most high-pressure pipe sizing tables, however, do not allow for fittings. You must, therefore include
fitting resistance in your calculations. The table title will indicate whether fittings are included or not.
The formula for deriving Tables A.1 to A.4 and A.8 to A.11, B.1, B.2, B.6, and B.7 contains a factor, (F = 1.2), which is used to multiply the piping or tubing
length to allow for a reasonable number of fittings. Tables A.5 to A.7, A.12 to A.14, B.3 to B.5 and B.8 to B.10 do not contain a fitting allowance (F = 1),
and Table A.16 or B.11 contains equivalent lengths of fittings.
How do you allow for fittings in high-pressure pipe sizing calculations? The resistance through a fitting is expressed as the equivalent length of
straight pipe. In other words, each pipe fitting is equal, in resistance, to an equivalent length of straight pipe.
To make your job easier, Table A.16 in CSA B149.1 lists the equivalent length values. This table lists values for threaded or welded fittings and valves.
Notes: Keep the following points in mind when calculating the number of fittings:
•The equivalent length of pipe run includes only tees that change the direction of flow 90°. Do not include fittings that do not change the direction
of flow (tees on the run, pipe couplings, unions, reducing couplings).
•Calculate reducing tees or bull-headed tees that change flow direction by the largest inlet size of the tee.
•Table A.16 does not show NPS 3.5 fittings. You will have to use a value between the NPS 3 and NPS 4 fittings.
•Where a regulator reduces the pressure on a section of pipe, calculate each section separately.

Sizing a high-pressure system steps summary
Sizing a high-pressure system is similar to sizing a low-pressure system, except for Steps 8 and 10:
1.type of gas
2.type of pipe
3.system pressure
4.pressure drop
5.pipe sizing table
6.pipe loads
7.longest measured run
8.guess code zone
9.size pipe
10.prove code zone
Special Steps for High-Pressure Systems
InformationDescription
Step 8Requires you to guess the code zone, based on the measured length of the piping run and an allowance of
equivalent length for the fittings
Step 9Sizes the pipe based on that code zone
Step 10A check to see whether you chose the correct code zone. This is very important because since you have
guessed at the code zone, you must check whether that pipe size will actually carry the gas load. You do this
by checking whether the measured length added to the equivalent length exceeds the code zone length.
Example (imperial)
Referring to Figure 6-13, go through the pipe sizing procedure.

Proof length of pipe runs
To proof the length of pipe runs, add the measured length of pipe with the equivalent length of pipe to find the length of equivalent run (LER). The LER of any pipe run must not exceed the code zone used to size
the piping system.
Procedure:
1.List all fittings on the run, starting with the longest measured run.
2.Look up their equivalent lengths from Table A.16.
Proof pipe A
3 -1 in screwed 90 @ 2.62 ft7.86 ft
1 – 1 in screwed T @ 5.24 ft5.24 ft
2 – 3/4 in screwed 90 @ 2.06 ft4.12 ft
1 – 3/4 in valve @ 2.06 ft2.06 ft
Equivalent length19.28 ft
Equivalent length (EL)19.28 ft
Measured length (ML)145.00 ft
Length of equivalent run (LER)164.28 ft
Proof pipe B
3 – 1 in screwed 90 @ 2.62 ft7.86 ft
1 - 1 in screwed T @ 5.24 ft5.24 ft
1 - 3/4 in screwed 90 @ 2.06 ft2.06 ft
1 – 3/4 in valve @ 2.06 ft2.06 ft
Equivalent length17.22 ft
Equivalent length (EL)17.22 ft
Measured length (ML)140.00 ft
Length of equivalent run (LER)157.22 ft
If both Pipe A and Pipe B's length of equivalent runs are less than the selected code zone, the code zone is okay. In neither case does the LER exceed the selected code zone of 175 ft. Therefore, the 175 ft code zone
is okay and the pipe is sized correctly.
Note: If any LER had exceeded the chosen code zone, it would indicate the chosen code zone is too short and you would have to resize and reproof the piping on the next longest code zone.

Sizing of propane piping systems
Propane systems, like natural gas systems, may have more than one pressure zone due to the fact that the supply pressure to propane appliances is normally 11 in w.c.
However, the propane supplied from a tank or cylinder, under most conditions, is much higher. (The vapour pressure in the tank is related to the temperature of the
propane liquid in the tank. See the Unit 3 Properties, characteristics, and safe handling of fuel gases for temperature/pressure relationships.)
You can carry out the pressure reduction from the tank to the appliance either in a single stage or in two stages:
Propane System Types
SystemDescription
Single-stage systemReduction of tank pressure immediately to 11 in w.c. with a regulator at the
outlet valve
Two-stage systemReduction of tank pressure to an intermediate pressure (usually 10 psig) in
the first stage, and then to 11 in w.c. in the second stage
Sizing propane systems
Once you have determined whether it is a single- or two-stage system, you can size it using the same procedure as natural gas low-pressure sizing or high-pressure
sizing. Annex B of CSA B149.1 provides the tables used for sizing propane systems.

Example of Propane System Sizing
The following example sizes a two-stage system using the high and low pressure methods previously reviewed for natural gas.
If you need to size a single-stage system, only use the low-pressure sizing method.
Refer to Figure 6-15 for a dimensioned sketch of the piping system for this example. Start with the farthest appliance and pick up loads as you approach the
propane container.

Using the appropriate table values
Proper pipe sizing is critical for the safe and efficient operation of gas systems. By following the procedures outlined in this chapter, gas technicians can
ensure that piping systems are correctly sized to deliver the required gas volume at the appropriate pressure to all appliances.
Remember that different systems (low-pressure, 2 psig, high-pressure, and propane) have specific sizing requirements and tables. Always consult the
appropriate sections of CSA B149.1 for the correct sizing information and follow all applicable codes and regulations.
